Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"I didnt think i was going to give it a perfect score but..... Its looks, smells, tastes, a 5, HOWEVER, the mouth feel is NOT BY ANY MEANS EQUAL TO LOOK SMELL AND TASTE. Pardon me i have to sit down. Mouth feel is, well 11. Yeh, like twice as good as anything ive ever had before. It grabs you by the face with both hands and says, 'what was that that just went down my throat'. It tasted familiar-- like real, pure butter on real Belgium-chocolate, buttermilk pancakes with fresh highbush blueberries, real Vermont maple syrup and Madagascar vanilla, served with Seattle coffee, and a shot of pappy.",5.0
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"So I just read a review that called the legendary KBBS, “typical…white trash.” It kinda made me nervous because I don’t dig white/pale stouts and I thought, “how could I miss that this being a white stout?!”
Well happily that guy is drinking something else. Or maybe he meant that KBBS is like Mountain Dew; enjoyed by European-Americans whom the reviewer is afraid of. Bah, who cares?
So KBBS. Looks great poured into a wine stem. Really dark lovely stuff. There’s foam for those of you who judge beer based on foam. Yep, it’s present. Looks like foam too.
The wine glass is supposed to enable the drinker to easily acquire aromas. This one is heavy on the adjuncts and, as a result, heavy on aromas that should be present but not so overwhelming. I am a lover of all things maple syrup so I enjoy it. Underneath the maple I get pretty standard, decent stout aromas of coffee, cocoa and roasted grain. Maybe mulberries? Yeah mulberries have an aroma and it’s subtle but rather pleasant. The additions aren’t artificial on the nose but just too much. Kinda like someone skipped the basics and went right to breaking the rules. I could go on at length about the fallacy of that approach but you don’t care.
After tasting many beers and learning how to pay attention to the different aspects of beer tasting, I have found that reviewing the “front,” “back” and finish is not NECESSARILY pretentious, it’s simply that many reviewers are. This one is actually kinda consistent. The nose is pretty reliable in telegraphing the initial flavor. The maple maple maple. Yeah it’s real maple syrup and there’s a lot of it. There’s definitely cocoa and quite possibly vanilla adjuncts present. I am not going to trash this beer because of the adjuncts - I knew that going in. But they’re aggressive. Dark fruit on the finish, for which I am grateful.
Given the abv and particular adjuncts, I expected a boozy, heavy feel with little carbonation and that is exactly it. Again, pleasant.
Of course some will reflexively say that the highest rated beers are overrated. In this case I agree but that’s a reactionary approach. This is a very enjoyable beer. Of late I have become increasingly skeptical of adjunct stouts because I truly think that they are too quickly used when experience and talent can produce a world of flavors without just capriciously tossing stuff in a barrel. In sum, the score is ridiculously high. But it’s too good to score it a protest one…",3.79
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2021 vintage, bottle #79

Holy. Fucking. Shit. KBBS. Beer review #1000. We're finally here. Legendary. I absolutely splurged on this one, but why not? Morbid curiosity got the better of me. I can't think of a better beer to review for this milestone than the highest rated beer in the whole damn world. I do love maple as an adjunct, so I'm (cautiously) optimistic for this one. I guess there's nothing to do now other than popping this open huh?

Pours completely pitch black with no head into the signature branded stemless teku, just a thin tan ring that leaves no lacing

The nose on this beer is an all out maple bomb, but there's a nice subtlety to it as well. I'm picking up on aromas of real maple syrup, light roast coffee, sticky caramel, pecan pie, milk chocolate, toasted oak, and light earthy bourbon

Man, I didn't want to like the taste of this as much as I do. It's not the most complex thing I've ever had but it is so goddamn good for what it is. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting sticky maple syrup, caramel candy, milk chocolate, fruity coffee, light oak, toffee, and raisin. The swallow brings notes of fruity coffee, sticky maple, spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, espresso, vanilla ice cream, pecan pie, and toasted oak. Sublime

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a velvety beer. Finishes surprisingly dry and boozy with a wonderful sweetness

I won't even play around, this is fucking amazing. Not top beer in the world amazing, but it definitely cracks my top 10. This is truly a once in a lifetime beer experience. I will likely never get another bottle again unless I make the trek out to Iowa with @Pru (who I allowed a few sips of this for his review) but I will cherish every sip of this one. More than the sum of its parts. Cheers BA!",4.64
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Celebrating my buddy @Rug with his 1,000th beer review. Pours an almost perfect black with no head. Smells lightly of maple syrup and chocolate. With the first sip I immediately tasted chocolate and caramel followed by a maple syrup finish. The syrup flavor lingers. The feel department is where this stout lacks. Feels very light, which is good for me as someone not too fond of stouts and lagers but to the avid fan of a heavier beer, this one may disappoint. Overall great beer and I’m glad I got to crack it open with my bud.",4.27
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Thick and syrupy pour, mocha head. Aroma is boozy maple, bittersweet chocolate.
Lived up to my expectations and very happy to try.
Mouthfeel was heavy, syrupy, smooth with light carbonation.
Nice barrel presence and all the flavors blend together neatly.",4.79
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Look - fantastic black and thick with a great tan head
Smell - maple and barrel
Taste - great maple coffee barrel taste
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - incredible but for the hype, to much maple",4.73
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Initial nose is beautiful maple! The taste is nice barrel, maple, coffee and chocolate. This is very rich and overall deserving of the high ratings. The only slight knock on this beer is viscosity.",4.96
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"A: Nightfall in appearance that presents a class, of shades, within the Bearded Iris: Before the Storm. Though, the arriving predominance peers to schemes of an Ayam Cemani, with dyed allocations on provoked (methodical) discharges. Inasmuch as, light charcoal to the late reposed tones of a Cayuga Duck, given the dark purple to aerated grey-green exhales. In conjunction, a fallow headpiece that’s brief in withstanding preservation. Yet, justifiably well-designed, as the accents address the Beaver toned collapse with a Dutch white lip. There is minimal adherence upon the necks fold, as that portrayal comes in balmy, goaded strides. Notwithstanding, the thermal development behind tack-distilled tears, for adequately webbing church windows. To that extent, a multi-layered scene that’s deep for optimization with each intermission

S: Malt is put into motion and characterized by the sweet/rich lexicons with a thick trek for pure maple, as a slight roasted bite aids in dimension. Thereby, ushering in dark chocolate on sticky toffee, while puck tamping a quad-sized shot in back. There’s a pastiness in the peripheral that fastens the bourbon adhesion to coffee beans. Coupled with, an aerated basecoat for raisin molasses gems, while strolling cold deciduous forests, as red maple and birch bark circumference pine resin. The barrel interiors coat figs and prunes beneath, while malt soothes midriffs above, before synergizing cask complexions. Accordingly, a caramel crème brûlée middle with a touch of frangipane/hazelnut praline, while the blend puts notice on vanilla oak staves. The furtherance becomes rightly victimized, by the prolonged exposure, where opportunities pit meaty leather to spice-pipe tobacco, as marshmallow fondant faints to the barreled derived coconut. This progresses to sawn wood, from the recoiled temperate woodlands, as a balminess curbs brandy to the dried fruit shifts and hard Chimes. In the interim, an oak sediment lingers with a dry hop bite amongst ricocheting malt, as bourbon pitches flat densities to the rhythm behind (soft) tannins

T: A proactive start on clean maple that measures a light bourbon dictation against roasted grains, as esters serenely interweave. The blend fondues oak atop Barhi Dates and Pain aux raisins, while summersaulting around prunes, before paying heed to Lemberger grapes. That aside, foretaste is mainly situated on rich Ganache over maple poffertjes, as a robust earthiness tends juneberries to dark rosin cascades. Mid-palate opens malt to bready dexterities with reacting nuts/walnuts, in the act of a polymer coalescence. Chiefly, a league for barrel mechanics besides toasted grains, as the equidistant hovers around caramelized toffee and chocolate cordials. In a prolonged/timely struggle, the progression veers off of fudge fondant for more complex - wooded - polymers set to vanillin staves, and oaked-smoked book shelves. Moreover, a greenhouse effect that becomes prevalent in the orchestration of deferred intervals. In light of oxygenating restfully across the hours, the blend incriminates Bual, from Madeira regions, and suggests charred figs with dried marzipan. In turn, a distantly placed roasted bite to the inclining warming degree, as the blend’s anatomy codas tarry skins with Mozhee extractions

M: A level of fatness that’s rich in fluidity, for levying a smooth, composited viscosity. The mechanics attend carbonation cautiously, by truncating the spectrum, for warming coordination behind that semi-tamed glueyness. Such factors roadmap a weighing scale, as vitrics breath open air, and course a drying constitute. In passing, the approach offers an adhesiveness without taxing saccharinity, while protracting an earthly bite to waddle an exsiccation with light (caustic) tannin physiques

O: The framework provides a eurythmic nature on maple, with a backing around barrel warmth and an elusive sense to earthy livelihoods. In centering agenda, the woody hop influence remains docile to the gravity behind malts blended depth, yet prompts in for balance and refines ester institution on clocked time. Consequently, forest fruits and backwoods are shrouded, by a tug-of-war sense of heft, but consciously linger with a palate fondness in step",4.23
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Draft pour at TG.

Pitch black with no head. Not too thick. At the nose is heavy maple with some coffee. I didn’t really pick up any barrels though. The taste is likewise the same, heavy maple with coffee and chocolate. Very little barrel as it warmed. Medium bodied, perfect carbonation. Not too thin nor too thick. Overall: a standard BA breakfast stout. Great beer overall but over hyped with ridiculous pricing. Glad I had a draft pour which cost less per oz than the bottle. It seems to me it’s almost the same as Mornin Delight.",4.49
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"2020 vintage drank 10/22/21
Incredible smell as soon as bottle was opened. Rich maple, chocolate, syrup breakfast in a glass. Incredibly smooth. Not a ton of bourbon flavor, and no alcohol burn. Not as thick as some TG stouts like assassin, but still an incredible beer and glad I chased it. Definitely one of the best",4.9
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,2020 vintage acquired during the pandemic. It was everything I'd hoped it would be and worth the drive to track it down. Wonderful aroma and such a smooth taste. Very few live up to the hype but this one did.,5.0
Kentucky Brunch Brand Stout,"Long time waiting to tick this one, and I have to say - pretty underwhelmed. Its delicious as far as maple syrup goes, but overall it was lacking in complexity. Barrel was light and not much else. Nice mouth feel and long finish.",4.56
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"Bottle, graciously shared by Clark at Peg’s. Dark brown pour with a light brown head. Inviting vanilla bean and coco puff aromas. Sweet with delicious vanilla, rich caramel, decadent chocolate, and woody notes. Some heat from the whiskey, but not overwhelming. More of a backbeat really. Doesn’t drink like a 12%er. Smooth, but complex with a very good mouthfeel and body. Bravo......",4.45
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"Unofficially my last beer of the top 250 (had the trade secured for it before changes were made to calculations, making me 20 short again...)

It glugs out of the bottle super thick and tar black. It has a finger and a half head of tight, thick khaki bubbles that recedes slowly to a thin film and collar that retain throughout. Leaves some nice legs on the glass when swirled.

Immediate strong aromas of boozy bourbon are softened by sweet vanilla and lightly toasted marshmallow. Fudgey brownie batter, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, toasted coconut, and charred oak all follow. There's just a hint of figs linger in the background.

The flavor is quite bourbon forward, but very round and smooth. It's like a scoop of real vanilla bean ice cream topped with burnt caramel, artisan fudge, and a shot of high end bourbon. Nothing pops much except maybe the bourbon, but this is quite well balanced.

The mouth feel is thick, but not overly so. It's slick and coats the mouth well, lingering and begging you to take another sip. Just the right amount (only a touch) of carbonation, and a bone dry, slightly boozy finish. Superb!

Overall this is an absolute pleasure of a beer to drink, and a worthy one for my ""last"" of the 250 list! It doesn't blow me away in the flavor department, but it does in its balance and roundedness! Those are things hard to find in modern BA adjunct stouts! The fact that I could EASILY solo dome this bottle says something!",4.68
Vanilla Bean Assassin,"As far as vanilla barrel ages stouts go, it is hard to name a better one than this. Very sweet, but just short of cloying. The huge fudge notes blend perfectly with that intense vanilla marshmallow presence. Don't miss out on this one if you have a chance to get some!",5.0
Marshmallow Handjee,"Midnight black with a dark mocha head. No real retention or lacing.

Chocolate, vanilla and plum stand out most in the nose. I really enjoy the fruitiness behind what is some very strong brownie batter and vanilla.

The taste is pretty similar. Loads of vanilla without it seeming artificial. High quality brownie. Fruit complexity underneath. And lots of heat.

Oily slick feel with soft fizz.

Probably overhyped, but still very nicely done. The flavors are all intense without being over intense.",4.34
Marshmallow Handjee,"Just because it can't be perfect, I guess, but it's damn close.

L:I was looking for Marshmallow Handjee. Looked for awhile. Looks cool in the bottle and better in my wine glass.
S: Mmmmm - did I see it can't be perfect? The nose on this gem is as close as it gets. Before the characteristic Dark Lord depth, there is the vanilla-creamy-sweet-smores thing going. And that's just the easy part. The complex, fine barrel notes compete with the earthy black malts and I love every moment of the struggle. If oil came from barley, this would fuel jets.
T: No surprises because the smell telegraphs the taste like an amateur against Ali. More of the vanilla sweet cocoa gram up front followed by the bourbon twisted chocolate caramel espresso of a great stout. It's all here.
F: It's like chewing bubble gum that never gets boring nor loses its flavor. Heavy like the punch that aforementioned amateur caught on the jaw though. Sloooww sipper.
Overall this is how it's done. An adjunct stout is never my first choice but, when done right, you get something like this. I don't like it better than the straight up WWS or some of the other simple, three ingredient brews, but it is damn good.",4.83
Marshmallow Handjee,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Heavy oily legs form on the glass after a swirl. Aroma is marshmallow and brown sugary initially. This overt sugariness breaks away to reveal roasty and toasty malts with a hearty bitter edge. Underneath is bourbon and late barrel character, which further counteract the initial sugary notes. Flavor profile pushes the same start - marshmallow and brown sugar, in addition to toffee. As these start-up notes fade, hearty barrel, bourbon, and roasty and toasty malts are revealed. The latter hearty notes becomes the storyline the second half, countering the initial sugary notes well. Mouth feel is thick, with a velvety, smooth, and full texture. Overall, while the sugary start leads to a dangerous territory, the following malt and barrel notes balance the whole experience out well.

Served from a 750mL bottle. Light blue wax. Allowed to warm ~45 minutes at room temperature after removal from the fridge. Reviewed from notes.",4.64
Marshmallow Handjee,"Been hunting a long time for this one and finally landed a 2019 bottle.
Remarkable how little this tastes like a regular Darklord. It's fairly sweet which i generally don't like, but the barrel presence compensates enough to make it really enjoyable. It delivers on all fronts with ton's of vanilla, chocolate notes and some heat from the barrel. It's also nice and thiccc.",4.9
Marshmallow Handjee,"2020 in 2022. Also had the 2021 and very similar to 2020.
Look - fantastic thick black with a great thick tan head and big lacing.
Smell - roasty malt caramel barrel vanilla
Taste - fantastic vanilla marshmallow caramel woody barrel
Feel - full body creamy light carb
Overall - just incredible",4.81
Marshmallow Handjee,"Brewing pastry stouts before pastry stouts were cool, the imperial stout that Dark Lord used to be has trended sweeter, more sultry, heavier and stronger as time has passes. Now doubling down with a vanilla-riddled, bourbon barrel aged version of that notorious elixir has allowed time to finally catch up with it.

With a thick, oily and onyx looking pour, Marshmallow Hanjee shares barely a trickle of froth before falling still. As its decadent scent of vanilla drifts gently above its sweet and savory roast, the scent of espresso, cocoa and nuttiness permeates an oxidized aroma of sherry, port and soy. Devilishly sweet, the beer's early cloying nature saturates the early palate with molasses, sorghum, vanilla cream and all-things burnt marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a full and lavish saturation of the tastebuds reveal bold complementary flavors of espresso, bittersweet chocolate, white chocolate, sweet wines and savory sherry, port and madeira. Hinting toward soy sauce, a late and whisky soaked taste of bourbon keeps the complex flavors of coconut, caramel, toasted oak and bourbon spice coming sip after sip.

Heavy, rich and undeniably cloying, the sipping ale is oily and warm on the palate, reserved as an after dinner digestif. A long, rich and fat maltiness clings to the mouth for an impossibly long and spicy aftertaste.",4.59

Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Good. Not noticeably better than normal abraxas. Id say overly sweet per style and too mich cinnamon. #3 beer on beer advocate LMAO no.

Okay. Fuck. The more I drink this the more I can barely finish the 9oz pour. Sugar cinnamon water. Cloying and WAY fucking 2 dimensional and cloying.",4.13
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"2021 variant - great viscosity and barrel on this - was missing the chili's and vanilla, but got a good bit of cinnamon, chocolate and coffee. Enjoyable experience, but expected a little more.",4.52
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Maybe I waited to long to open my 2020 bottle. Mostly chocolate, mild cinnamon, slight coffee which aren't bad. Zero vanilla or pepper. Not bad overall but I expected more from BA's #3 rated beer. Won't go out of my way to acquire another bottle.",4.27
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Look - black, thick, copper head dissipates quickly
Smell- Smooth licorice, molasses
Taste - BA imperial stout at its best. The right balance of vanilla bean, cinnamon, whiskey, with the dark smooth licorice and molasses stout. The chilis are not overpowering at all, adding just a hint of flavor without overpowering heat.
Feel - smooth, thick rich",4.84
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"This is a beer I've been wanting to try for some time now (was able to obtain it in a trade for Fremont B5K).

The beer pours fairly dark, blackish brown color with good head retention and considerable lacing. The beer certainly looks impressive enough. On the nose, I pick up vanilla, green chili peppers, some chocolate, underlying coffee and considerable whiskey. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, though I thought it a bit hot on the finish (something that is especially noticeable, given the chili flavor in this beer). That being said, the barrel aging seems to mute the base beer flavors in this beer somewhat, and really doesn't seem to blend in all that well. It does add another flavor component/dimension, which is always nice, but the whiskey flavor otherwise doesn't seem to bring a lot to the party in this beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full otherwise, and the alcohol seemed to be pretty well integrated into the flavor profile. Drinkability is pretty good, though it's hard to imagine drinking more than a small amount of this beer at a sitting.

This is a very nice beer, but given it's reputation, I confess I was expecting a bit more from it. Very glad I had the opportunity to try it, but this probably isn't a beer I'd want to seek out again.",4.31
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Lucky enough to try this one at Xul Beer Company's first bottle share on Nov. 10, 2021.
Poured into an event glass.
Look- A deep black with a nice tan/brown head covering the top.
Smell- Nice chocolate and caramel mix with a hint of cinnamon. The barrel was present but not as strong as I expected.
Taste- Mostly followed the smell except the bourbon added a nice little kick to each sip. The molasses taste seemed more toward the middle of the pour.
Mouthfeel- Smooth with no carbonation. Not as thick and had nice lacing.
Overall- A first class stout with a great finish.",4.98
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Appearance - The poured a thick black color with a dark tan head. The body could block out the sun.

Smell - The nose radiated chocolate with the spice of a cinnamon cookie.

Taste - Initially, the beer was like boozy chocolate. The cinnamon brought to mind spicy cinnamon cookies with ancho heat. Notes of raisin juice and dark fruits follow. It was a bit warming toward the back with a lingering spice.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a huge smooth body with little carbonation.

Overall - The beer may not have been exactly as I expected, but it was quite nice.",4.55
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Pours very dark black with a thin tan head on top, Smells of Cinnamon Toast Crunch soaked in Bourbon which I think is pretty nice. The taste of the beer has the cinnamon and the touch of spice in there along with the vanilla and chocolate. The feel is nice and silky, doesn't burn the throat or mouth from the adjuncts which is perfect. Overall it's an outstanding beer and was fortunate to try it finally.",4.34
Abraxas - Barrel-Aged,"Big time grail for me. Vintage 2019 on tap at Bier Station, consumed and reviewed October 2021.

Pours black with a finger and a half of dark caramel foam. Good head retention. Aroma is spices, cinnamon, chocolate, toffee, caramel, and molasses. Roasty and toasty malts offer up a firm base, adding a strong malty stout backbone to each whiff. As the sweetness crescendos to a peak, barrel character sweeps in to add some char, bourbon, and bitterness. Alcohol remains an after thought, allowing the beer to shine forward of its ABV. Loaded from first whiff to last sniff. Flavor profile is more of the same - a firm stout base of roasty and toasty malts form the foundation of cinnamon, spices, vanilla, caramel, molasses, toffee, and cream. It opens up less spicy than the nose, but finishes more spicy than the nose, that is to say, the dynamics are shaped in contrast - mirrored. Only caveat to the mirror image is the barrel character notes of char and bourbon that come thru at the end again, dropping this stout an octave into deeper heartiness. Despite the bourbon character popping through the beer, the beer never comes off as hot. Mouth feel is thick with a smooth, consistent grit. Its feel is uniform from front to back. Overall, incredible depth with loads of barrel complimenting the initial spices well. It borders on an ADHD stout, spreading it's attention in a spiderweb of directions, but remains cohesive enough to form an intoxicating melody.

Draft. 8oz pour.",4.64

A - Very hazy medium orange gold color with a dense ring of creamy white lacing.

S - Bright citrus, citrus rind, dank pine, and earthy peppery citrus rind. ,

O - Not, sure why I've never reviewed this before because I've had alot of it in the past. Final verdict? Enjoying this beer equally as much today as I did when I first had it. This Classic never gets old (IMO), just total all around class. One of my all time favorites.",4.46
Heady Topper,Pours a hazy gold. Thick foam. Juicy sweet hop aroma. Loads of dank hop flavors. Some sweetness. Some bitterness. Loads of juicy goodness. Not for the beginner but definitely very drinkable and a must have if you love IPAs.,4.75
Heady Topper,"Canned 8/18/22. Purchased that day at the brewery.

L: Normally kept in the can, this one pours a hazy dark orange with a big head that quickly thins to a film with splotches on the cap and a thicker ring around the glass. Lacing is minimal but attractive.

S: Huge aromas of everything good. Floral, citrus, tropical, mixed berries, and pine. Incredible.

T: Strong hop character in your face up front. Mellows a bit in the middle to reveal some delicious juicy fruit and berries, but the hops never take a back seat. Finishes dry, but not as bitter as the hop punch would suggest.

F: The hop onslaught provides a sticky, resinous mouthfeel, which is not a criticism.

O: Heady Topper takes no prisoners. An absolute hop smackdown that also showcases a wide variety of aromas and flavors. This is the DIPA for those who think west coasts are too bitter and hazies are too juicy.",4.74
Heady Topper,"I opened a pint can, bright citrus (mostly pineapple), pine and herbal hops greeted the nose. Bready malt and citrus juice give the impression of sweetness, alcohol is noticeable. I drank out of the can for a few sips, bitter, semi-dry and boldly flavored. Hops are way out in front, juiciness masks the malt flavor. Bitterness rises throughout the taste.

Next, I poured most of the rest into a mug. Pale orange-straw body, very hazy with a rich creamy white head that quickly shrunk to a cap that lasted leaving rings of lacing. The taste is best this way and represents a well-made Imperial New England style IPA.

Next, I added in the dregs, and I can see why this is not recommended. The haze changed to cloudy and turbid, the taste changed to peppery bitter with a slight funky juiciness. I don't mind the dregs; the white pepper bitterness hides the alcohol and keeps the sweet juice taste in check.

Medium bodied with plentiful carbonation, bold, bitter and still balanced but I wouldn't call it smooth. Lightly colored for the style and begs the question ""Should there be an Imperial NEIPA category?""
Following of the pouring guidelines is highly recommended.


Canned on 7-25-22",4.74
Heady Topper,"My second favorite beer of all time. Absolutely nothing but awesome deliciousness throughout. Unfortunately I live in Wisconsin, and have to pay my brother to send me 4 packs. I love the somewhat malty hopped taste, when you open a can it’s aroma is almost as good as the taste. It’s been around for years, yet with all the new brews coming and going, it has rarely met it’s match.",4.75
Heady Topper,"I’m not understanding the hype around this one. My buddy from MA sent me a four pack for my birthday so I have been dissecting this for a week now.

Pours a wonderful, slightly hazy dark straw color with an immaculate head.

Aroma seems a bit lacking. Sure it has hops but it isn’t overwhelming or any better than the other 100 IPAs out there. Kind of citrusy with a touch of pine.

It’s a little malty for my liking. Thick and heavy. The hop oils really coat the tongue. Bitterness is average, not too much.

It’s a good beer but not world class IMO.",4.15
Heady Topper,"Look: Yeah, I know, I poured it out into a glass – old habits die hard. Light orange and cloudy with a silky-looking pure white head that builds up and holds as a lid, ever-so-slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Ripe peaches, mango, tangerines, strawberries, cantaloupe melon, pine, some kiwi, kumquats, Cannabis, blueberries, and some sweet malt
Taste: Opens up with a barrage of citrus fruits and resinous pine sap that seemingly gain strength as they develop. Peaches, mango, and mixed berries pop up both together and separate as the journey continues and dankness also makes it presence known here and there in no-so-subtle ways. Malt sweetness tries to keep up but is continually beaten back by the hops and closes with a conifer-laden finish and a delectable, strong bite
Mouthfeel: Full, a little slick, medium-high carbonation, and felt and I’d say medium-strength dryness on the finish
Overall: Wow, this is outstanding. To me, this was the OG I heard about, here on BA, before the NE-Style IPA trend migrated West and when I saw a month-old can, I had to try it as I haven’t been a fan of the sub-style much since it took over here but figured and wished I would be. Happy to say, this is my type of beer though as it absolutely captures the amazing aromatics that the late/dry hop additions and yeast can being to the ‘hazy’ style but it drinks like a WCIPA without the chewy feel and an awesome, pithy bite, and plenty of dryness. Color me WAY impressed and I’d buy this again and again in a heartbeat. Thank you, The Alchemist, for creating this gem and props on blowing me away right out of the gate, as that doesn’t happen often",4.84
Heady Topper,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single from a local bottle shop for $5.25. No canned on date. This must be fresh because this doesn't get distributed here very often and it usually sells out pretty quickly.

Look: Pours a mildly to moderately hazy pale yellow/golden color. The head dissipated quickly. This is very pale for an 8% ABV Double IPA.

Smell: The aroma is very expressive. Tons of dank, resinous hops. A bit of citrus thrown in too. Up front, I get a strong green bell pepper note. This yields to citrusy notes and resinous, piney hoppiness. I get notes of grapefruit and lemon hard candy, along with secondary notes of papaya and mango.

Taste: This is really good. It is actually quite drinkable given how aggressive it is. Up front, it's citrusy and dank. The finish is tooth-enamel stripping bitterness, in a good way. It has a strong bitter finish with lots of woody pine tar, grapefruit pith, and lemon rind. The finish is very dry and the bitterness lingers long.

Feel: It has a slick and oily mouthfeel with a relatively soft carbonation. Medium bodied.

Overall: This is my first time trying Heady Topper, as well as my first time trying anything from Alchemist. There is so much hype around this beer, so it was almost impossible to live up to it. But it actually manages to come pretty close. What I find most interesting about this beer is that it is so different from ""New England-Style IPAs"" that are made by 90% of breweries today. To me, this beer is more West Coast at heart than it is an NEIPA. This beer reminds me of Lagunitas Super Cluster, which I know is all-Citra hopped and I do not know which hops are used in Heady Topper. I would think that there at least has got to be Citra in here too though. Also reminds me a bit of Foley Brothers Prospect.",4.24
Heady Topper,"Very difficult beer to find in my area. Luckily, there was what appears to be a one time drop at my local store - very limited amount. I scoffed two 4 packs. This is definitely a solid brew, but I don't find it all that drinkable. I was never able to drink more than one before wanting to move on to something else. Pretty one-dimensional to me - bitter, bitter, and bitter. I prefer a more balanced, multifaceted IPA.

If I come across some I will probably purchase a 4 pack, but it's not something I will be actively seeking out, there are plenty of other beers that I prefer over this one.",3.72
Heady Topper,"Alchemist Heady Topper Imperial IPA, 8% ABV. Can is dated 05/09/22. Pours...wait, didn't pour it, per the label. Nose is a forest of big f'ing pine trees. Taste follows, and though hugely bitter, still quite drinkable. Excellent mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Overall world-class. I've got sap in my beard and I'm belching pine trees.",4.4
Heady Topper,"Maybe it's because it has been hyped, maybe it's because I drank it in a glass rather than from the can (as suggested on the can), but I was underwhelmed by this most hyped of IPAs...

It does look pretty good, has a very piney smell that just doesn't resonate with me, and the taste is full of that same resin that comes from pine. I suppose there are many that swear by it, but this just isn't what I was expecting from a ""world class"" beer. Mouthfeel was smooth, I do have to give it that, actually very smooth. Out of respect and acknowledgement I did give it an overall higher rating than I normally would, but in the end I'm walking away feeling, well...meh...",3.84
Heady Topper,"I've been fortunate enough to have this multiple times and each time I'm impressed. Looks the part of a fantasticly crafted IPA. Pale yellow color with a nice murkiness. Smell is off the charts when fresh and bursting with pine and citrus. Just like the nose there is lots of pine and orange zest, but never overly bitter. Dangerously drinkable even though its a bit hefty in the body. I've had multiple in a night before and though the morning after was a touch rough, I didn't regret a single sip. Overall, this beer is worth every bit of praise it receives in my opinion.",4.88
Heady Topper,"Finally found the Holy Grail in Colorado. Unexpectedly pine-forward. I am sick of all those juice NEIPAs out there. This is a NEIPA style with pine, The perfect IPA. I bought 20 of these, and they'll be gone by the end of Memorial Day.",4.94
Heady Topper,"Dave Dave Erazo vacationed in New England and brought my son and me some Alchemist brews. Fresh Heady Topper at refrigerator temperature poured from the can (!) into glasses. Slightly cloudy pale yellow body with a pure white cotton candy head. Aroma is powerfully hoppy, sort of reminiscent of the pungent Ballantine ale from Newark in 1971. Very good beer. It's hop flavor and aroma are accompanied by a lasting flavorful bitter aftertaste. For myself , I could use a bit more malt body, possibly with a little less alcohol. But this is a memorable modern IPA, probably the best one I've tasted.",4.19
Heady Topper,Best NEIPA I have had. Super drinkable and all around delicious. A light sweetness to the malts balances with a hearty hop bitterness and makes it more refreshing and easier to drink than I expected. Great beer.,4.91
Heady Topper,a little over a month old. tried some from the can but i preferred drinking from a glass to get a good whiff of the hops while taking a drink. It is slightly foggy with a good head and lacing. Nice citrus smell. citrus follows to the taste with pine balancing it out. i had my doubts but it lived up to the hype.,5.0

Blessed,"Batch 2, 2022

Oh man, here we are. The highest rated beer from Alaska, and 8th highest rated overall on BA. Getting Anchorage beers is always a treat, but I’m expecting this one to go beyond a treat. Let’s pop this bad boy open

Pours a very dark muddy brown with a finger of reddish dark brown head that immediately fades to nothing and leaves no lacing but decent sheeting

To call the nose decadent would be a massive understatement, I could smell this one from the second I cracked it and the aroma filled the room. I’m picking up on aromas of sticky caramel, thick fudge, toasted coconut, sweet bourbon, cinnamon, dates, light roast coffee, nougat, and a touch of maple

While it is certainly good in taste, it doesn't quite reach the levels of the aroma, though there's still a lot going on. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting chocolate cake, black cherry, sweet coconut, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, and a touch of fudge. The swallow brings notes of chocolate cake, toasted coconut, creamy vanilla, sweet bourbon, fresh oak, fruity coffee, dates, and burnt caramel

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a rich and slick beer. Finishes slightly sticky with a touch of boozy heat but nothing overbearing

This is truly an awesome beer. I'm sure many will complain that batch 1 was better or some stupid shit like that, but having had only this one, it's amazing. What a treat, cheers BA!",4.55
Blessed,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours jet black with insanely dark brown head. The head disappeared within seconds, leaving an array of very small coconut chunks floating on top. Looks fantastic.

The nose is absolutely insane. Thick layers of vanilla, coconut, bourbon, chocolate, toffee, marshmallow, a touch of maple, figs, and more sweet fudge. This is definitely on the sweet side, but it just smells thick and creamy.

The taste is marvelous. In addition to the vanilla, fudge, coconut, and bourbon, some of the roasted malts from the base stouts comes through. Marshmallow and some dark fruit. The coconut is definitely on the toasted side, at least that is what comes through. Some burnt toffee, a touch of coffee grounds, and some oak bitterness on the back end. Overall, this hits all the senses and makes for a great ride. Not overly sweet on the taste.

Mouthfeel is thick and creamy. Long aftertaste. Overall, a fantastic BA stout.",4.52
Blessed,"Dark, inky body, opaque; carbonation burbles percolate above a flat crown with no head. Very rich, powerful aroma; fudge and milk chocolate; roasted and charred grain; moderate sweetness. Very sweet and spicy taste; cocoa and milk chocolate; vanilla and cinnamon; coconut; raisins and figs; fairly bold alcohol presence simmering beneath the sweetness. Heavy body; slick and chewy; very rich residual sugar feel; some alcohol warmth noted, increasing as the beer warms.

This beer exudes decadence and richness. The overall sweetness is a bit overpowering. I think the alcohol notes are more from the beer's ABV rather than anything from the barrel aging. The lack of any head is also a minus. Still, taste-wise, and overlooking the dominating sweetness, this isn't a bad imperial stout, just lacking some depth and complexity that it really could have it had a bit more balance between the malts, coconut, vanilla, and barrel-aging used in its creation.

King JJJuliusss,"Canned on 8/9/22; consumed on 9/9/22

Pours an opaque, rusted dark orange body capped with two fingers of creamy, off-white foam; decent head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, moderate, frothy collar, amd layers of chunky, webby lacing encircling the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh orange juice sit atop a fluffy malt foundation, soon welcoming peach, passionfruit, and grapefruit peel as undertones of catty dank poke through over time and musty lime eases through the closing impressions.

Taste offers candied grapefruit and sugar-dusted orange as a passionfruit zest meets musty lime to balance a level, tropical citrus overlay, while subtler undertones of fresh peach/mango linger on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-full body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a weighty fluff of glossy resins through the mid-palate; a creamy counterbalance to a largely subdued grit on the back end eases to a soft hop twang and minimal perceptible bitterness through the finish.

Sweet fruit saturation sports detailed edges of earthier dank, and while heavy on the palate, maintains a steady, balanced presentation of ripe, juicy resins throughout.",4.07

Mornin' Delight,"2021 bottle split 3 ways, was fortunate enough to win this in a charity raffle and wasted no time enjoying it

Look - an aggressive pour into a tulip glass looking like oil with a nice two finger mocha colored head

Smell - the maple, oh the maple! While it dominates, also get some notes of vanilla, toffee and chocolate

Taste - The maple sweetness definitely hits at first bit there is a good balance with some roasty coffee and semi-sweet chocolate flavors. Outstanding

Mouthfeel - it's thick, syrupy and coats the mouth nicely

Overall - just an absolute world class beer, my only wish is I would've had some waffles or French toast for brunch to pair with it",4.77

Mornin' Delight,"2021 vintage, growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck

Serious question, does Half Time ever disappoint? Any time I’m heading to New York I make a point to stop in there, and I always find good stuff that I can’t really find elsewhere. In addition to 2015 vintage 120 Minute IPA, they had this for fills. A successful trip there yet again. I’ve wanted to try this one for a while, currently sitting at #7 of the highest rated beers of all time on BA. I’m very excited to try this, so let’s crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

It’s not even a question that this is loaded with maple in the nose, but it feels very authentic. I’m picking up on aromas of maple candy, medium roast coffee, sweet caramel, nougat, milk chocolate, raisin, and vanilla creme

In taste, it has an interesting vibe where it’s even more sweet, but also quite balanced in its sweetness. More or less sweetness from different notes working together well. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, light roast coffee, marshmallow, sticky maple, and light bourbon. The swallow brings notes of maple candy, sticky caramel, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, toffee, and candied raisin

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a super slick beer. Finishes very sticky with a bit of boozy heat

This is good no doubt, great even, but it is very sweet. Because of this, I can’t give it reslly anywhere near the average. A good beer, but there’s better options for this kind of thing",4.45
Mornin' Delight,"Had both 2020 and 2021 on draught. 2020 - the coffee faded quite a bit, the maple is dominant to the point of being a maple bomb. If you like maple in your beer its great. 2021 had lots of coffee on the nose and the flavor. I definitely preferred the fresh one as it had both the coffee and the maple. Good beer.",4.06
Mornin' Delight,This is the perfect blend of maple and coffee. It is very difficult to get the maple syrup correct in a beer. It has the perfect thickness and is probably my favorite non barrel aged beer.,4.99
Mornin' Delight,"5oz pour at Carmine Street in NYC.

A NEW BAR HAS BEEN SET.

I’m not sure how this is so perfect. Warm without being boozy, sweet but balanced beauty. With all the extras, the backbone is a well developed stout. This is a magic experience.

I am blown away that anyone could complain about the $15 pour. Most of NYC just had a mediocre pinot noir for $15 and found that normal. This may be the very best pour value in the city. Go in before it’s gone.

I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",4.98
Mornin' Delight,"Pure black pour with a huge maple nose. Lots of maple flavor balanced with coffee. Thick, velvety mouthfeel that leaves syrup stickiness. Just a great beer!!",4.99
Mornin' Delight,"Had a fresh ten ounce pour on tap into a tulip glass. The rich and luscious cocoa-colored foam pours two fingers deep over a nearly black base, and slowly dissolves leaving ample lacing coating the surface and the rim of the glass. Powerfully aromatic maple and coffee is detectable a foot away. Bringing the nose in closer reveals underlying notes of chocolate and an intense maple and coffee that is simply about as pleasing as can be expected from a beer. The taste is fresh maple and coffee, chocolate, molasses and syrup with just a hint of roasted malts and hops from the base beer. Thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall just short of life changing, but if every coffee stout were this good it would be a better world.",4.72
King Julius,"Not every beer is deserving of the hype it receives. This is not one of those beers. It's wow-factor off the charts in every aspect - no need for me to list my amazement in every category. If you can obtain this beer, and you generally enjoy NEIPA style, this one's a must. Near-flawless brew.",4.74
King Julius,"With utmost radiance, vibrancy and brilliance in its hop display, Tree House's Imperial New England IPA hits hops pinnacle. In a world of princes, they are the king.

And the excellence in King Julius is not only expected but also realized with a creamy peachy-taupe and golden hue with airy textures in its creamy meringue-like froth. The beer's muddled appearance only works to make the session more appetizing. A slow separation of froth ale underneath suggests a viscous character that carries over to a creamy, tangy-sweet and fruit-filled taste just after a grassy, citrusy, herbal and sprucy scent starts out like a fruitier citronella.

The flavors that simply blossom on the middle palate are abundant with a bursting fruit display. Branch-ripe tangerine,in all its tangy, fructose-sweet and vibrant glory springs to life with a zesty support of grapefruit, lemon and lime. Tantalizing tropical fruits join the taste with pineapple, pawpaw and kiwi nuances. Smooth in the beer's fleeting finish, a sense of herbal sherbet with citronella apply their final and lasting impressions of spiked fruit punch.

Creamy and malty-dry, the taste starts plush on the palate but trails into a semi-dry, smoothly bittered, softly resinous and tea-like finish. The soft sappiness of fresh and perfumy cedar links up with fragrant citrus peel for an evaporative minty cooling and a nearly teeth-churning creamy tartness that aligns with gin-spiked sorbet textures as well as flavors.",4.6
King Julius,"16oz. Can served in a Spiegelau tulip. Pours a dull orange with a hazy clarity and a frothy, half-inch, off-white head. Nose expresses bright notes of Mandarin Orange and peel. Taste follows nose with a light herbal bite at the finish. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a consistent, almost assertive carbonation. Overall, very tasty but not sure it warrants the hype.",4.04
King Julius,"Canned 8/19/22. Warm yellow orange color, totally opaque hazy beer. An inch of just off-white head on top which hangs around a good bit, and laces the glass well. Nose is as advertised, orange cream, mango, honeydew melon, ripe and sweet and a bit floral at the end. There are so many good NEIPAs out there that I often think they start to run together... then I taste something like this. Sweet at the very beginning, but also floral, big citrus notes, grapefruit and orange peel, with a silky feel. What's incredible is how clean it finishes for what really starts out pretty sweet, but the grassy and a little bitter orange hop resin at the end leave your mouth not overly sweet at the end. The booze is present, but it plays in the background. The bitterness shines through especially at the end in a really satisfying ""take another sip"" type of way.",4.81
King Julius,"Canned: Jul-29-2022

""The Crimson King's balcony beer"", indeed.

Wow. It really is cranked up about as high as could be in terms of orangey lupuline saturation. Drinks like Orange Crush toilet wine made in a Scandinavian white-collar prison in heaven. That or an Orange Julius from hell. Either way, only the best.

Big and rich and fruity and creamy and boozy. It is big enough to require easing into while never approaching harshness or anything off-putting in the flavor. Lovely look to it. Aroma and flavor are an at once complicated and simple blend of tangerine, clementine, apricots, grapefruit rind dipped in honey, pithy citrus oil, weed that has been rehydrated using orange peel, I could go on. Again, wow....

Like with most of the IIPAs from TH, this is as close to perfect as you can get. A balance of all the individual components of the style each unique, each cranked to 11 but each in total harmony with the others. Textbook example of what the style can be.

One other thing I want to add here for no real reason. I am far from a TH expert but I have a decently experienced palate and have had a few dozen of their beers over the years. These are the first of their beers I've had in a couple years cause of the pandemic and damned if their packaging has not gotten even more incredible (at least compared to the best packaging you find in Quebec). A month old and just mellowed right into itself. No vague hints of oxidation, no fading or changing profile over the few cans I've had of this (and others ranging up to a month and a half old). Anyway, cheers to the canning line. Based on their many date code messages I've seen over the years and including this one I think we'd all enjoy sitting around listening to music together. You guys rock!

Cheers, KC!

This is a beautiful beer. It pours a thick, creamy, deep orange with a billowy white head. Smells of juicy mango and bright citrus fruits.

Appearance: Deep gold color with 2-finger white head. It is deep with a very hazy complexion, like many New England IPAs. Head is very thick, and it lasts a minute, leaving a small covering. There is a medium amount of lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong aroma of citrus and pine, as well as some hops and pineapple. The citrus and pine aromas dominates the other aromas.

Taste: Bitter taste from the hops with a moderate sweetness like citrus. The sweetness and bitter edge are well-balanced. Has a very nice after-taste that lasts a moderate amount of time. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Medium body. Average alcohol, which matches the 8.2% listed on the can.

S: The aroma contains strong floral and dank hops, strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

Zenne Y Frontera,"Batch 5, Blend 49, Season 17|18, Bottled 4/11/18

Review 1200!!! For this landmark review, I'm tackling the highest rated Traditional Lambic on BA, which also happens to be the 10th highest rated beer overall on the site. This one has been a huge want for me for quite some time now, so I'm happy I managed to source a bottle. I will drink half of this immediately and decant the other half for about 20 minutes, as suggest by 3F and others who have reviewed to see the difference. I will take the highest of the 2 for the official rating, but I'm sure that will be the decanted version. Let's pop it open

Pours a cloudy deep orange with just a thin ring of bubbles which obviously leaves no lacing. Expected for the style, and I don't think decanting will make a difference in this regard

The first whiff of this tells me that decanting is probably the move, as it feels like it needs to open up a bit first. Pre-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of peat smoke, leather, oxidized sherry, wet hay, and white wine vinegar. Post-decant, I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, tart peach, white peppercorn, oxidized sherry, wet hay, wheat cracker, toasted oak, light smoke, and stone

The same applies for taste, this is super funky and almost aggressive pre-decant. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, olorosso sherry, sharp oak, leather, sweet honey and light smoke. The swallow brings notes of peat smoke, wet hay, old leather, vinegar, sharp oak, lemon zest, and apple skin. Post-decant, it really opens up. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting lemon juice, pear skin, oxidized sherry, toasted oak, earthy wheat, wet hay, and a touch of peat smoke. The swallow brings notes of oxidized sherry, peat smoke, wet hay, lemon zest, tart peach, wheat bread, stone, light leather and sharp oak

Much like the appearance, I don't think decanting will have any effect on the mouthfeel. A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a sharp and funky beer. Finishes bone dry with a hefty funk. This is so damn refreshing that I could literally chug it, but obviously I wouldn't do that

Wow, this is truly awesome stuff. I mean, I can't say I'm surprised, I knew what I was getting into, but it was an absolute honor. Paired wonderfully with a smoked bleu cheese and fig pecan crackers. I couldn't think of a better beer for 1200. Cheers BA!",4.54
Zenne Y Frontera,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass.

Pours a beautiful gold color with a light haziness to the transparency. Head is two fingers of white foam. Aroma is sherry and barrel right off the cusp. Funky stone, lemon, and earthy notes round it out with a light funky nose. Sherry smooths things out, elevating the whole nose from base, while delivering stronger, more potent notes of dried fruit. Flavor profile builds on the nose, hitting sherry and barrel character first. Stone, lemon, tangy green apple, and earthy notes round it out - again. There is a sublime twist of funky tartness that does well to give the whole flavor profile an additional dimension. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. Texture is driven by a consistent, smooth, even texture. Overall, just a splendid beer, in each terms of complexity, quaffability, and thoughtfulness. Lovely.

Great lambic but was expecting the Pedro Ximinez barrel to be more apparent.,4.25

Zenne Y Frontera,"Bottle @ La Palma Sour Fest 2015. Hazy orange colored beer with a small white head. Holy smokes is this funky. Tons of musty, damp, earthy basement and mushroom notes. Bright lemon and green grape acidity. Slight apricot sweetness and perhaps a hint of vanilla. Really nice mineral quality to it as well. Pretty citrusy and zesty as well. A winner, as usual.",4.42
Pliny The Younger,"Pours a slight dark gold with a light frost to the transparency. Head is a couple fingers of plush white foam.

Aroma is a pleasant quick hit of tropical fruits, citrus, and mild resin and grass. It melds together sugary hop notes seamlessly with sticky hops for a dramatic, dynamic, quick-hitting aroma. Light bready malts adorn the back of the aroma profile, but are faint in comparison to the hops. Hops are never loud, instead, they land at a mild volume of ""six"" on a scale of 1-10, ten being the highest. Instead of using volume, hops are overlapped to create complexity.

Flavor profile is light tropical fruits and citrus at the onset, sharing the spotlight with resiny, grassy, piney, and mild herbal and floral hops, before dipping back into tropical fruits at the finish. Pine notes build in intensity as the beer warms, but it refrains from crossing into overly sticky or heavy. It's never overtly sweet, nor does it carry a bitter bite at the end, as do some west coast IPAs. Instead, the end is marked by a light dryness that marks an end to hops. That dryness is accompanied by bready malts.

Mouth feel is medium-thick with a consistent, crisp texture driven by a mild effervescence. It's just thick enough to drink more like an experience, and less like a parking lot, tailgating IPA - though I would never turn down a pour / bottle of this in the latter situation.

Overall, this beer embodies wonderful balance, along with thoughtful nuance, to create a dreamy smooth IPA. Hops are pleasant, plump, and forward, without carrying the pedal-to-the-metal force of some other IPAs. This one is marked and adorned by simplicity and nuance.

Pliny The Younger,"On draft on March 25th and bottle today. In the past four trips up over a decade, Pliny would always have an unmistakable distinguished character to it. It was the Cadillac of Russian River. This time I called the server over. ""Are you sure this is it? Not Happy Hops or something else?"". Nope. This was Younger. More acidic and lacking the smooth richness and piney, sticky aftertaste, and gone was the once amazing nose of sap and sweet burnt sugar. With three to try on this visit, I had just one pour, and was, like my friend, stumped and disappointed. The vibe of visiting Windsor was pleasant, I took a self guided tour, the wait in the spring sunshine a mere three and a half hours, and the food there scrumptious. My friend and I shared a bottle of Refraction, a collab with Brooklyn Brewery, and that seemed to have more to offer. Still, I purchased two bottles of PtY to go to give it another shot at home. Pouring it now in a four ounce glass akin to what they served it in at Santa Rosa, I have the same vibes from it. I got a four pack of R&D #4 from the gift shop and enjoyed those more. Alas!",3.0
Pliny The Younger,"Appearance - The beer poured a clear golden color with visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The earthy pine notes were strong in the nose. By way of comparison, it smelled like in the amped up version of Elder.

Taste - Having sampled Pliny the elder first, I will use it as a means of comparison. Younger seemed like an amped up version of Elder. The green grass and hops was next level. The pine notes left a little room for sweetness, but there was somewhat of a backbone. The pain notes lingered in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had the body of an imperial, with carbonation scrubbing away the sweetness and allowing the bitterness to linger.

Overall - Hype-worthy. Glad I got to try some, thanks @bret27",5.0

Pliny The Younger,"Welp, it’s been about 18 years or so on the hunt for this elusive brew. Ever since finding craft beer through Sam Adams in the early college days of the mid-2000s, this has been the ultimate Sasquatch beer. Spent most of my years on the east coast and college in Arizona but never took the trip to Northern California. Then finally, living in San Diego, they decide to send more kegs for 2022. Incredible find through a random Google search. Turns out the owner of Fathom Bistro & Bar knows Vinnie. I figured it would be similar to the best beers from HF/TH/Trillium but it’s so different. It’s the perfect West Coast hoppy beer but amplified. Super resinous, dry, and dank. Amazing finish. Feel and body are so smooth. Flavor is obviously off the charts. This is worth the hype!!!",4.87

Barrel Aged Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"2021 batch.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells very strongly of coconut, with loads of milk and dark chocolate, very slight roast, light bourbon, and lots of creamy vanilla.

This is definitely sweet, but honestly, not as sweet as I expected. This really does meet the hype that it garners - it's exactly what you want out of high quality pastry. The coconut is done so well, it's so bright and vibrant and just plain tasty. There's a little bit of barrel, it helps anchor the beer slightly. The vanilla is also done very well, and it's all just layered on top of a very tasty and creamy base beer.

This is very creamy and rich, with no real booziness to it at all. It's very, very drinkable.

I almost didn't want this one to be good - I don't always like Angry Chair and this is such a hyped beer. Fortunately (unfortunately?) for me, it's honestly awesome. This is the best Angry Chair beer that I've ever had.",4.81

Smells like chocolate with some light bourbon notes. Taste is the best chocolate I’ve ever tasted in a stout. Rich, sweet chocolate balanced perfectly with a slight bourbon taste. Mouthfeel was also perfect just coating the tongue. This beer blew me away! I’ve had the non BA Version years ago and it was very good but this is in a league of its own.

Poured into oversized snifter. Completely opaque Hazy darkish yellow. Head settles to sticky lace that coats glass. Tropical notes on the nose, sweet and cracker in the background. Starfruit, citrus, slight dank but more clean. Taste is same, fruity, papaya citrus with nice hop bitterness at the end. Probably overused, but “pillowy” is the only way to describe the feel.

Very Hazy,"Canned 8/3/22. Purchased 8/16/22 at Charlton.

L: Pours an opaque gold with a thick big-bubbled head that stays a while. Irregular but pretty lacing.

S: Aromas of peach, strawberry, guava, lemon and tangerine. Quite a medley.

T: Citrus up front, followed by peach and strawberry. Finishes dry and slightly bitter with some dankness. Very little heat for the ABV.

F: A bit pricklier mouthfeel than is normal for Tree House. Medium carbonation.

O: Very enjoyable. The taste and aroma aren't quite as memorable as the initial appearance, but still a fantastic beer. Outstanding melding of peach/strawberry with citrus.",4.52

Canned: Jul-29-2022

""Long days and pleasant nights"" on the date code

Lovely look as per usual. Glowing gold, hazy, ok covering of creamy white head that leaves swooping lacing. The aroma is dank and earthy compared to what I was expecting, with some stonefruit and clementine sweetness underneath. Perhaps a tiny bit faded, but I might be having an off day. Delicious and enticing regardless. The flavor is (as expected) a barrage of peaches, citrus (sweet not tart or bitter) and weedy hop funk. There is definitely more to it but on the whole it is a balance between peachy sweetness, canteloup, clementine and the more resinous (but not sappy) character of the hops. Mouthfeel is spot on as usual, creamy, round and filling while also refreshing. Really nice beer. I think it was Haze that I once described as a sweaty hippie taking a nap in the shade after a day of harvesting peaches. Well in this case the hippie is also burning one and we are smelling his feet after stomping up some overripe peaches to make wine. Or something like that I have no idea...

Very Hazy,"really cool to get to drink this, so thankful i have people in my life who want to share this kind of thing with me, but i am just shocked that this comes in at number 15 on the BA top beers list, like in the entire world, seems outlandish for something i would not even describe as insanely well refined or anything, and yeah the hop profile is great, but it also has some burn, some unneeded weight, feels under carbonated to me, and really doesnt distinguish itself as elite in any way. that might sound harsh, if this was from my local watering hole i would be pretty stoked, but to get all in a tizzy about it is simply foolish, which is not true of all the tree house hyped hazy ones by the way, but is true about this one. super dense looking from the 12 ounce can, high frothy white headed and all, but dull a little bit and chewy, not as maybe well refined as expected or as very green was pretty much right next to it. i wish they told you the hops, but then i guess everyone would copycat it, but it seems somewhat conventional, like citra could be driving it along with something just slightly spicy at this dosage, a bit of bitterness which i dont hate, short of green burn, a fine line in this style and they walk it, but i am perhaps seeking a little more. it warms up favorably before the alcohol takes over, i get green pear, orange tic tac candy, and a little white grape, its tasty, even downright awesome, and i like the way it kind of permeates the tongue and hangs after each swallow, its semi permanent on the palate. not oily or slick feeling through, truly a new england type to its core. minimal grain flavor but all the body in the world, nobody would call this balance, and i dont need it to be, but it seems big for the sake of it, like the hops dont even want this much structure, and not that its forced, but just that its not perfect, as the ratings seem to suggest. i like their yeast and its used well here, its a little short on bubbles for a big one, at least for my preferences, and overall the flavor cannot be denied, this is yummy, but is it objectively amazing beer leagues better than the rest in this space? heck no. one of the more anticipated but least epic tree house beers ive cut into, which is still to say its still excellent, but it certainly has a peer group...",4.17

A Deal With The Devil - Triple Oak-Aged,"A: The emergence is dense on lucidity with a materialization that ensues oily margins. Similarly, a visibility on fingers thru a firewater viscosity, at a state where the collar is annulled, if tolerant on time. The pour is deep on mahogany, and transcendent on ruby highlights, while the neck transcribes a copper to chestnut tone. Correspondingly, a thinning out on retention to the hour, which terminates lace delicately, before that annulled header addressed above

S: The cask recitals circumference the subtle (earthy) hop effects, which quarter the esters, while building a strong dexterity around sweet – bready – malt. An inclination on dark fruit that ranges to elderberries, when exhibiting dated prunes amongst raisins. Sequentially, an armored disposition on Crème caramel that’s been slightly browned to aptness, before taxing in a Mackintosh bar. The inclining humidity brawns a treacliness over a Black Forest Chocotorta & liquored truffles, while pitting leathery advances against brown sugar tobacco. Synchronously, a hop bite to softly cuddle malts candied advances on creamed variations, when sylvan elements develop upon the tarry dried fruit inclinations. With this in mind, a bittering – woodsy – expansion that’s deepening on pine resin around timberlands, yet a facilitating aid to not overextend the greenery virulence. Moreover, a step that nears Goobers with a charred following on walnuts, besides stale cherry bitters to coriaceous stipulations. Oxidation is lightly pressed against the late solvent esters that work to benefit the movement, by suggesting a Pedro Ximénez cleverness, while barreling the oak staves at length

T: Bourbon continually pillars the complexity with a warming – humid – torridness on malt, as hops lightly frame a woodsy path. The elements touch on a caramelized fig custard, while parading crystallized stone fruit in a molasses – marshmallow – soufflé. Secondly, a posturing sweetness to neighbor an unwanted cloyingness in balminess; however, a position that’s impeccably groomed to cloak heat. In sequence, a spice to fruit component that prompts Ethyl Caproate under the residual malt pleasantness. There is an ongoing sentience over the varying cask proportions, which are competently equipped to gamble on the sustained aeriation. Thusly, meandering polymers to further provoke/strengthen vanillin aside honeyed spices, while continuing to calibrate the oak lactones. The barrel presence continues on to address almonds with lightly shredded coconut, as a hard Skor emanates against fudge. In addition, liquored raisins applied to charring, when shriveled cherries pass cordials & cola taffy, once hops attune that backwoods kick to face grape – brandy – bugs. A measure that becomes thirsting of tannin stipulations in the patient exertions, as dried leaves spread from a nearby – progressive – ruin

M: Sidesteps under-attenuation in the inclusive duty, of not overwhelming the rich records. Nonetheless, the approach is sweet with a chewy dexterity and a warming sensation, while carbonation is handled in a judicious manner. An approach that does not burn or madden the slick feel, as longevity offers a calm smoothness, in the act of intellectualizing a system over the dry (oak) tannin mannerisms

O: A hop bill that’s cautiously tempered against a glucose powerhouse, which bypasses the aggressiveness on bite, while still prominent to ally the esters. They offer a balance to the finer points on wood amid the several transfers, as malt sweetens the complexity chronologically, in anticipation of the craftily dry hooks. An onset that’s censoring on depth with a tough buildout; albeit, an advantageous/more beneficial buildout, if given the patience to draw out time",4.25

Fundamental Observation,"Serving: 1 Pt. 0.9 Fl. oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. This is the 2019 edition, so a little age on it. Sorry, it's all I could find! The bottle has 2 check boxes though, one for ""drink fresh"" and one for ""cellar and save"" and the latter is checked. So I'm at least following the rules.

A: Pours super dark and thick, motor-oil like. Nice lacing up the glass. Minimal off-white head that fades quickly.

S: Huge vanilla up front. It's like extract, maybe vanilla coffee creamer. Super on the nose, with a little bourbon note behind it.

T: Again, vanilla is the centerpiece. It's a real sweet vanilla note here, I know it's not extract, but it's so concentrated and strong. Bourbon there on the finish, really a second player to the vanilla.

M: This is where this beer really excels. Nice, full mouthfeel. Very balanced. The vanilla is huge, but so is the bourbon. Feels like everything is in HD. Way chewier and thick than some of the more recent BCBS beers I've had.

O: Okay, well. This is very good. I'll start by saying I am not familiar with BL at all. I always noticed FO at the top of the 250 list, but it was so out of reach, I didn't think much of it. Was very fortunate to take a vacation to SF recently and a shop still had some '19 bottles left. Seems like the big comparison point with this beer is BCBVS, which I can totally see. I haven't had that beer in some time, so this isn't a 1:1. But I'll say just from memory that this beer is every bit as good, if not better. My initial impression is that I like the mouthfeel and balance of this beer more. But I do feel the vanilla flavor of BCBVS might be a tough better. This is really strong and vanilla forward, and it's a really sweet and pastry-like vanilla. Not that I want it subdued in any way, but BCBVS has it reeled in and maybe a little more natural-tasting. I really feel like I'm splitting hairs here. At the end of the day, it's huge props to BL for making a really good, chewy, balanced, BA stout. Oh, and I think the age may have even helped this beer. I get no sense of oxidation or fading of flavor. Again, the vanilla is huge on this.

Recommendation: I think this beer deserves its ranking and reputation. Must try for any BA stout fan.",4.79
Fundamental Observation,"The beers pours the expected blackish brown color with minimal lacing and fair at best head retention. This beer has the look of a beer that has seen some pretty significant barrel aging (though it's not overly viscous). On the nose I get dark chocolate and vanilla, with underlying bourbon and light licorice. It's nice but I was expecting a more robust aroma profile. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fairly sweet stout, but with a much greater level of intensity. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, moderately sweet finish. Carbonation seemed to be on the low side, which I tend to think works well with rich, BA impy stouts (like this one). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit. Even so, there's no way I would guess an abv. in the 14% range.

This is a very nice BA impy stout, no doubt, though I guess I was expecting a bit more complexity. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I'm not sure it's a beer I'd go out of my way to find. Still a very solid beer...",4.35

Looks lethal and the nose goes as deep as you want it to. I could sniff this all day; there’s dark rye bread, beef jerky, baker’s chocolate…
That flavor, though. It tastes like a pastry - fig, vanilla, caramel, flaky shell - that doesn’t actually exist. But then it’s also cake! Steph sez: “It’s like they crashed a full bakery into the bottle.”
4-way mud wrestling match between all the vanilla (both bean + barrel, yet without any booze from the latter), sugar, dark fruit, and roasty notes. Everyone takes a turn without taking over.
It’s a perfect example of barrel aging, it’s savoury, it’s dessert - walks a razor’s edge. How is it so cakey without being that sweet? How does it tame the sweet without being charred or boozy? Not hot, ashy, cloying, sugary… the execution is just baffling + masterful.

The aroma has notes of vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, caramelized brown sugar, brownie batter, oak, and some light smoke and dark fruit notes. The vanilla however is the show here - its absolutely dominated by the vanilla and its lovely.

Taste follows the nose with notes of roasted malts, dark fruits, vanilla, sweet cream, bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, chocolate and yea, vanilla. If you like your vanilla stout to avoid subtly this is perfect. Its sweet, but dances up to the cloying line without going over. The barrel aging is nicely balanced. There is a light smokiness that I occasionally get, but I suspect that is the influence of the bourbon.

Nose is a sort of light smoked cherry wood, not at all what I expected. First sips are great! The mix of bourbon barrels is very complex. You don’t get any one distinct flavor, but rather a changing swirl of sweetnesses and woods. The vanilla comes in mid-palate with a sort of vanilla bean shell earthiness, a hint of coffee-ness without the coffee. The malts are deep, robust, providing a massive foundation. Some of that cherry comes back toward the finish. Mouthfeel is perfect: Full but crisp and refreshing. Alcohol has that bourbon flavor, but no noticeable bite or warmth at this stage.

A Deal With The Devil - Double Oak-Aged,"2022

Drinking this is comparable to drinking cold brew coffee concentrate that I forgot to water down. The intensity of flavors makes this absolutely unique. The relatively short time in the barrels seems to leave the oaky depths and nuance behind in favor of a massive straight up bourbon presence. This works well with the strong toffee and raisin base. This does not represent my favorite approach to double barrel barleywine, I will continue to buy multiples of everything Kane offers at a fraction of the price while this is a one and done purchase. But, these are flavors I enjoy at intensity levels that no one else offers. If you are curious, I say try this once. This is leaps and bounds better than Wendigo.",4.65

Top popped (53 degrees) with a whimpering sigh, got a nice coffee aroma right away. Almost zero head at all made for a full pour into my 12oz Avery Brewing snifter.
Bourbon and espresso coffee share the nose space.
The first taste matches the nose. Chewing on it a little reveals notes of fine cacao, bit of vanilla, faint oak barrel, a dark fruit I can’t quite put a finger on and a welcoming heat.

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2014 Vintage

Appearance: Black with a small, dark, beige head that quickly faded. Age probably took a big hit on the head size.

Smell: Fairly prominent bourbon aromas and moderate coffee aromas. Not bad, but again age is a factor here as well as the appearance.

Taste: Bourbon notes, prominent coffee notes, mild brown sugar notes, and mild tannic oak notes. The coffee comes off a touch bitter but considering the age of the beer it's not bad and provides a nice counter to the bourbon notes.

Mouth-feel: Mediuml-bodied with a fairly low level of carbonation. Not a bad mouthfeel but age is a factor.

Overall: While the beer wasn't bad, I get the feeling I'm only getting a glimpse of how good the beer was fresh. hopefully it's rebrewed and I can get my hands on a fresh one.",4.09
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Goose Island – Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout (BCBCS – 2014)

12.6% ABV

The beer is listed as “Stout – American Imperial” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 years. Beer poured into 2012 BCBS snifter.

First Impression: Pours dark, thinner than BCBS. 4.5

Appearance: Standard Bourbon County. An aggressive pour years only a small amount of khaki head that fades quickly, leaving only a small ring around the glass. 4.25

Smell: Coffee up front. Mostly this cold-brew smelling with a hint of grounds and also the dread ‘pepper’. Weak barrel on the nose. 4.25

Taste: 2014 and earlier BCBCS is what all coffee stouts should be judged on for me. As the kids say, ‘it fucks’. And after this many years, to still say that? Come on. Taste starts with the coffee, shifts to bourbon, pulls in some chocolate fudge brownies, shifts back to bourbon, finishes on coffee, and then a slow finish lasts for longer than most BA stouts, let alone BA coffee stouts. Impressive for 12.5% abv. 4.70

Mouthfeel: Coffee stouts are always thinner than their regular counterparts. They just are. While this is clearly thinner than the regular, not appreciably so. For judging this against other coffee stouts, this is still upper echelon. 4.75

Overall: This is a great beer, and I’m jamming on this. I debated about whether to have this tonight, because I have to get up in 4.5 hours to hit the BCBS release. Well, I’m glad I did, but only because I chose to drink this tonight. It’s really fantastic. It’s incredible how well this has held up. I did have this a few years back (just once), and while it was great, I don’t remember enjoying it quite this much. This is just singing tonight. It’s everything that I want. And the finish just keeps going. I’m in heaven. All this said – could it be better? Of course. I’d love to have even more barrel. I’d love to see how this shined at 15%. But for what it is, and compared to others, this is Heaven. 4.65

Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"Bottled 7/25/17, cracking this open just over 4 years later

Oh boy, we have quite the whale here. From what I've heard, the coffee BCBS is one of the most sought after variants, and 2017 is unfortunately the last vintage. I never really expected to see it on a shelf anywhere. However, when visiting DC this past weekend, I decided to pop in a liquor store to search for some of the Dogfish Head spirits, since we don't get those up here in Mass. Well, I found their whiskey and was happy, but decided to check out the beer selection. This one was staring at me and I immediately snatched it without looking at the price tag. Worth it? Let's find out

Pours a velvety black with a finger of dark tan head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing but very strong legs

This is wonderfully balanced between roasty and sweet in the nose, like a decadent coffee drink mixed to perfection. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy caramel, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate covered espresso beans, vanilla creme, ripe fig, smooth oak, and just the slightest hint of sweet blueberry

The fact that this has such a strong coffee presence after 4 years is very impressive. Many of these beers tend to fall off in flavor pretty quick, but it is beautifully preserved here, despite not being full force. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting creamy vanilla, lightly spicy bourbon, milk chocolate, medium acidic coffee, and light grape. The swallow brings notes of decadent milk chocolate, oily espresso beans, burnt toast, a touch of that vegetal green pepper character others have complained about in older bottles, and earthy oaked bourbon on the aftertaste

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and viscous beer. Finishes mostly dry from the bourbon heat

This beer is awesome! It doesn't quite crack my top 10 though I suspect it might if fresher. Regardless, I'm very happy to have tried this one, and here's to hoping they bring it back next year!",4.53
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2017 Vintage

L: Deep black with a slight twinge of brown

A: The winner in my opinion. Bakers chocolate and coffee all the way.

T: Do not drink this beer cold, severely underwhelming. Once it warms there is a strong chocolate syrupy goodness up front followed by a slight sweetened Cuban coffee. While I assume the coffee has dropped off some, still provides a strong aftertaste which makes it more enjoyable.

M: It’s bourbon county. Always proper almost syrup like.

O: While a damn good beer, I think the hype train has won with the coffee BCBS. I have not had a lot of them, but I prefer the regular. Maybe I’m in the minority here. Still great though.",4.66
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2014 vintage poured into a pint glass.

Appearance: Pours impenetrable dark brown with no head at all, leaving a slight sediment behind in the bottle.

Smell: Very rich coffee and bourbon, a bit of chocolate. No green pepper.

Taste: Phenomenally smooth and deep. Starts with bourbon, shifts to dark, acidic coffee grinds, finishes with a delightful burnt bread roast. My only demerit is that I find the bourbon ever so slightly too dominant on some finishes.

Feel: Full-bodied but not too heavy, with light carbonation. Bit of alcohol on the finish, but not too much.

Overall: It's a huge beer, really well put-together. It's a bourbon-lover's coffee stout, with a very prominent bourbon character that somehow still doesn't mask the big coffee base.",4.56
Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout,"2013 Vintage - Los Inmortales Coffee

335ml bottle - lightly chilled, poured into a snifter.

Appearance: Pours a coal-black hue - slightly thin, with a deep reddish-mahogany ring around the top edge. Zero head, zero foam, zero collar. Just sits like liquorice-coloured liquid in the glass. Lifeless.

Nose: Surpriseingly, the coffee is still here - and quite strong. The coffee is deep, dark, roasty and pungent, with an almost stale quality to it - like a gas station coffee maker that hasn't been emptied or cleaned in a day. It almost smells sticky and concentrated, very much like Kaluha. Zero green pepper. There's some deep roast beneath the coffee, along with a bit of an ashen/smoky note. Some tangy dark fruit peeks through, as well as some bourbon, and if you really dig deep, some vanilla, oak, and baker's chocolate emerge. Not much warmth. Coffee dominates.

Palate: This 7 year old stout greets the palate fairly sweet, with some rich chocolate fudge, brownie batter, vanilla, bourbon, and oak, before an intense coffee presence explodes and takes the lead. It's a miracle there's still so much coffee in here. The coffee is sweet, black, roasty, with some fresh whole bean notes. Saturated, almost like coffee liqueur, and then finally showing some of that stale back coffee character. A whisper of tangy dark fruit pokes out, before some coffee bean bitterness begins to show, quickly compounded by blackened malt bitterness, drying this out very quickly and fully. Some more subtle bourbon, followed by some less subtle barrel reappear, and the finish approaches, bringing sticky black coffee, roasty beans, bitter malt roast, pure cacao, charred malt, and spicy charred oak. No lingering sweetness.

Mouthfeel/Body: Admittedly, I expected this to be thin, given its age, but surprisingly, it's actually packing some nice heft when chilled. It isn't luscious or chewy, but before it warms, it does have some nice viscosity, though it does thin out as it warms. Effervescence is extremely low - not still, and there is some subtle fuzz in there, but like a cup of soda the morning after you poured it. Quite sticky around the lips, but almost fully dries out in the finish with all that roast.

Overall: This is a difficult one to rate. Is it fair to formally review and rate a 7 year old coffee stout that I've never had? It may actually not be. I'll never know how this was when fresh, but even now, I'd say this is a perfectly respectable barrel-aged coffee stout. Strong coffee presence, no green pepper notes, essentially no oxidation, and maybe just a hint of staleness to the coffee. The bourbon and barrel are subdued, and the effervescence is lacking, but as-is, this is still a great coffee stout. The fact that it has held up so well is definitely a testimony to the early-mid BCBS era. Smoke 'em if you got 'em. This is the most you could ask for in a 7 year old coffee stout. I have to wonder if the 2013 was particularly coffee-forward, because apparently less ancient bottles have already lost their beans. Certainly not the case here, but I wouldn't hold onto one any longer than this. Gracefully aged.",4.21

Purchased from Goose recently, so I assume it was stored properly. It has none of the vegetable taste I have had in some older coffee BCS. This bottle is perfect. A wonderful balance of coffee bitterness and the sweet BCS barrel notes. I love the smell. There’s a lot of coffee here. Drinking it I get a lot of coffee too.

Very GGGreennn,"Serving: Can
Canned: Aug-10-2022

Pours like they all do... Very nice, glowing orange haziness with a creamy cap that sticks around till the end. Aroma and flavor are a complex, layered mixture of tropical and non-tropical fruits and different ""green"" characters just like the OG Green (probably my favorite beer, and definitely my favorite NEIPA) but turned up a bit. This does not drink like a gimmick. Nose is still a little rough around the edges. But is a melange of sticky, resinous fruit. The flavor is grapefruit oleo, underripe guava, green mango, pine sap. It is so wonderfully sappy-yet-sweet and hop layered/laden. It reminds me of the first time I had Heady Topper*. Morning dew in the Rockies at the break of day after a late night around the campfire. Hot dogs. America. Fuck. So good.
Truly loverly.

There’s dank citrus flavors up front on taste, but it’s that passion fruit/mango/pineapple trifecta that makes this beer for me, and the full, creamy mouthfeel that accompanies the bit of hop bite at the back end is just the cherry on top of this excellent beer.",4.5
Very GGGreennn,"Canned on 6/2/22; consumed on 6/17/22

Pours a turbid, mango purée-esque body topped with multiple fingers of rich, fluffy, slightly off-white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and thin, soapy curtains of webby/spotty lacing draping down the entirety of the walls of the glass.

Aromas of dank peppermint beneath layers of juicy pineapple and mango slices dominant, with dense undertones of bubblegum yeast accented by papaya as a subtle, bready malt welcomes an earthy, catty stank to the back end of the bouquet.

Taste highlights orange contrasted by sweeter peach upfront, progressively dank and overripe into musty passionfruit and guava over the mid-palate as a catty dank proceeds into bready malt easing into mossy undertones on the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body and a moderate carbonation, rounded and fluffy to a peak of creamy overtones and contrasting juicy, boggy resins; a hop twang emerging in the back end guides to a refined, earthy grit marking the finish.

Myriad juicy fruits and boggy hops bring an onslaught of lush, full-flavored character within an overtly resinous containment; supremely, comprehensively expressive, this is an immense display of hop variation from Tree House at its peak.",4.42

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not really sure what this is other than a variation of ""Green"" so I'll leave that up to you to research, I'm just going to drink it! It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of creamy white foam. The aroma expresses passionfruit, soft orange, nectarine, and hop resins. Tasting it reveals a sweetish, basic malt that's bready and must be made up of of 2-row brewers malt as well as wheat and oats although I can't taste the oats specifically. I'm finding passionfruit, pineapple, peach, orange, and lemon/lime as well as more hop resin. There's a lot of hop bite to it, and a decent amout of bitterness although there's also a lot of malt to balance it. Things are becoming clearer to me now - this is a double IPA, and not just a more heavily hopped version of ""Green"". I actually like it better. The additional maltiness softens it and allows the hop flavors to come through more clearly. It seems less bitter, although it's probably got more IBUs. Beyond that, the hop bite is smoothed out. There's additional alcohol but it doesn't stick out any more than you want it to in a double IPA. It's dry in the finish but not as dry as the original, and it's certainly not as seemingly bitter and biting overall. I find it very rounded and smooth, while at the same time still a bit of a hulk of a beer. I'm about halfway through so let me comment on the head retention and lacing, and then the mouthfeel. The head has held up really well and I still have a creamy surface covering. The lacing covers the glass with swirling 'stained glass' and sweeping waves breaking into spots of sea foam. Almost all of the Treehouse beers have great head retention and lacing and this is no exception. In the mouth it's medium-full in body and beautifully smooth and fluffy. I am impressed!

Mouthfeel: Smooth as a dolphin. Maybe too smooth? I would be happy with more of a carbonation bite.

Taste: I don't think it's as citrusy as people are saying, but that isn't to say there is no citrus/tropical fruit. Fruity up front then quickly transfers to a puckering bitter floral/piney taste. Almost reminiscent of a west coast at the end if it wasn't for such a creamy mouthfeel.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a murky golden/brass colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The head appears to be holding quite well as is always the case with Treehouse beers. The aroma delivers sweetish and bready malt along with notes of passionfruit, nectarine, some mild hop resin, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of passionfruit, pineapple, orange, citrus pith, and a hint of lemon/lime. The malt is basic and sweetish. It's bready, and oat-like. A very firm bitterness makes it's way through all of the sweet malt (it's got to be more bitter but you just can't tell) but there's also a whole lot of acidic ""hop burn"" and it finishes dry with some passionfruit, soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium but feeling a little fuller because of all the extra proteins from the wheat and oats, and the carbonation and hop acidity gives a gentle bristle on the tongue before becoming smoother. The head has held up really well and it's left some beautiful lace all around the glass. I'm quite pleased with Very Green and feel that it's actually better than Green but that's just my opinion. Regardles, it remains a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.

Very Green,"16oz can courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ.

Poured into my Precious Things Teku (my one and only Teku), this was an opaque yellow-orange color, with a good sized & creamy looking off-white head. Lots of lace.

Nose is of tropical and citrus fruits. Initially just sweet fruit scent, as it warms a more bitter, pithy aroma seeps into the background.

More complex than the nose lets on, although the beginning is straightforward tropical fruits and Mandarin oranges, Midway through there's a more pithy, bitter happiness. The level of bitterness is just right to add a shade of complexity to things without clashing with what came before. Things finish off smoothly, with a slightly dry bitter zap to the palate.

Medium bodied, with a mouth feel that's a bit creamy.

V.S.O.J.,"Pours a rich dark brown color that is impenetrable by light and features a creamy mocha colored head that lingers a bit before dissipating to allow you to focus on the beautiful beer in your glass and the aromas drawing you closer.

And what magnificent aromas greet you - rich English toffee, vanilla, a bit of fig, oak, and a smidge of booze, all in perfect balance. I am literally drooling.

The toffee is forward on the taste as expected, but it willingly allows room for the vanilla (hurray!), oak (double hurray!), and especially the fig (cubed hurray!) that provides balance to the sweetness of the other components and coasts into the boozy warming at the back of the palate. Simply stunning flavor profile and nuance to a beer this big (13.8% ABV).

Moderately heavy oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl, foreshadowing a heavy, hearty beer. Head is two and a half fingers of khaki foam.

Aroma is raisins, fig, toffee, molasses, and dark fruits mashed together with leathery, spicy bourbon. Barrel adds additional char and heat, which is smoothed out well by hearty caramel, toasty, and bready malts. That dark fruit character really starts to swell up and become a much more major player in the aroma as the beer warms.

Flavor profile is fig, raisins, toffee, molasses, brown sugar, and hearty dark fruits. Grassy hops add some resinous hop presence, which introduces some pleasant variation to the profile that is not a sugary note, heavy malt, or bourbon. Bourbon is present throughout, but becomes much more present on the back half of the flavor profile, building up heat and complexity akin to the way a snowball builds rolling down a hill. Despite that build up, it never runs away with heat. Underneath it all is strong caramel, bready, and toasty malts.

Mouth feel is thick with a still effervescence, offering up some light bubbles at the start before smoothing out at the mid-way point. A very light silt adds some further texture, but really, it's smooth. The texture matches, both, the aging process output, and alcohol, suggesting this beer has been slowly pressed flat by the act of time and heavy alcohol.

Overall, a remarkable beer that pairs bourbon barrel complexity over a resounding barleywine. Regardless of notes, it's a remarkable beer for sipping, offering complexity and depth at every corner and crevice.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz can. Canned June 29, 2021. 15% ABV.

For kicks, this was served side-by-side with Piggyback 6yr Rye aged in V.S.O.J. barrels. This is a sample from barrel #1. A few notes: Dark coloration, with moderate oily legs after a swirl. Spicy rye on the cusp of the nose, with heavy barrel leading way to floral and mild bourbon and dark fruits behind. Complexity is dense, mixing in a little cake at the finish. Flavor profile brings a more mild profile, building spicy rye over oak, lemon zest, floral and mild dark fruits and bourbon. Spice simmers on the back of the palate long after a sip, emphasizing the rye base. Really smooth, with a crescendo from start to finish that resembles a wheelchair ramp - a linear rise from start to finish.

Served neat in a Glencairn glass.",4.7

One I’ve been wanting to try for awhile. Revolution Barleywine base with a higher carb than I’m used to, but doesn’t detract at all from the beautiful complexity of oak, molasses, caramel, and bourbon. Mild esters and warmth on the tail.",4.69

V.S.O.J.,"I received a can of this famous Barleywine from @fbarber in the NBS BIF #14. Can dated 6/29/2021. Poured into a Revolution Deep Wood Series glass also received from Mr. Barber. It pours a deep cola color with a fizzy, light khaki-colored head that dissipated quickly. It boasts a great Barleywine smell with toffee, brown sugar, raisin, plum, tobacco smoke, oak, and subtle but discernible bourbon. The taste is ridiculous! It's particularly fruity with lots of raisin, plum, and fig, along with loads of brown sugar and toffee, oaky char, tobacco, and a strong, hot bourbon presence. There is little bitterness. The tastes really pop; it's incredibly flavorful. Its mouthfeel is rich and creamy with appropriate and pleasant carbonation, and there's no escaping the 15% ABV; you can feel the alcohol burn.

Poured dark reddish brown with minimal head that dissipated quickly, no discernible foam either, but continuous bubbles appear from the depths of the glass.
The aroma was bourbon and malts, taste is almost sweet but isn’t, not sure how that happens. Figs, raisins, plums all swirling in the bourbon.
The taste rather follows, just more intense, amazing flavors and the 15% ABV is well hidden. Really, really good.
The feel is viscous enough to carry the weight of the flavors without being cloying. Great sipper!

Smell - The nose was sweet. Notes of caramel and earthy malts came before the booze.

Taste - Oh my! Caramel lead the way, followed by leather and mild bourbon. The booze was so perfectly balanced that it took nothing away from the base beer. This is an example of a beer that slept well in barrels. The profile was modestly warming but certainly did not burn.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick but not cloying. It lingered just long enough to have me wanting more.

Magnificent aroma. Pineapple, Orange, passion fruit, lemon notes and a dankness provide a pleasurable experience. This aroma is the feature of the NE style that I like most. Use a tulip glass and enjoy the aroma throughout.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Juice Machine is a double NEIPA at 8.2% ABV, It's poured a murky orange and gold body beneath a two finger thick head of slightly yellowed off-white foam. The aroma suggests orange, mango, papaya, and a hint of grapefruit. The taste is fuller, as usual, and offers up everything found in the nose along with additional notes of peach, some floral character, passionfruit, spiciness, a little bit of melon, zest of lime, some hop resins, and a touch of mint. The malt is sweetish and bready. A median bitterness balances it and it finishes dry with some hop resins and spiciness lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a lot of extra proteins but also with a little bit of zing from the acidic ""hop burn"". As usual for Treehouse the head has held up really well and there's a great amount of fancy lacing throughout the entire glass. I don't know if that's because of all the extra proteins or how carefully they're processing their beers (probably both) but they always have great head retention and lacing. This is my third can of Juice Machine and I've blown through them fairly quickly because although it's full of flavor and ""dank"", it's not as ""dank"" or intense as some of their other beers. They make a few NEIPAs that are even more accessible, and this is pretty complex so I'd put this somewhere in the middle range of what they do.
Review #7,995",4.44
Juice Machine,"16 oz can poured into a wine glass. Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a billowy off-white head. Great retention and lacing - simply beautiful. Aroma and flavor feature sweet juicy tropical fruit, citrus zest, melon, creamy wheat, and hints of herbal/spicy/dank hoppiness. Mouthfeel is smooth and moderately carbonated, but not as pillowy as Green/Alter Ego/certain other single NEIPAs from TH. Just a hint of booziness. It's really good, but doesn't (for me) attain the highest level of NEIPA greatness.",4.28

Look: Pours a dark orangish yellow. Hazy and full with a foamy head leaving a thick lacing.

Feel: Full and juicy. A bit sticky. Intense hop burn which flattens a bit as the beer warms.

Overall: Very fruity DIPA with a beautiful look and a full body. Taste-wise it's leaning more on the sweet and tropical side, which, for me, doesn't work as well with its sharp zestiness.",4.37

Juice Machine was a pseudo-whale for me for a while. For some reason I just could not get the timing right with my trips to Tree House and releases of this beer. Unfortunately, in the last half a decade or so since this debuted, Tree House has only become better at making beer. So it's not exactly mind-blowing compared to some newer offerings. If I have any real criticism, is that there is too much going on here. But I can see how some would really dig the laundry list of fruit flavors.",4.31

Julius,"On draft at the brewery. Gorgeous in a tulip glass. Good mouth feel, I could definitely crush more than one of these. Tastes of citrus but not overwhelmingly so.

An excellent NEIPA but I could easily name half-a-dozen from around New England that I like at least as much. Clearly more sampling is necessary.",4.53
Julius,"Canned 7/21/22

My first foray into the Julius “family” was King Julius a couple hours ago, and after pouring this guy, I see - and smell - a lot of similarities. The regular version appears to be slightly paler than the double version, and the head dissipated more quickly as well.

The nose on this however is hitting me more in the face than “King.” I’m getting wafts of canteloupe, mango and orange, and it’s very citrus-forward. Smells fantastic.

The taste is very similar as well, although this tastes slightly more malty, and the feel is definitely nowhere near as chewy. I get much more melon lingering after the sip has faded, as well.

I sipped on King Julius for more than an hour, but I feel like I would crush the regular version all day. Great beer.",4.66
Julius,"Why is Tree House so hyped? Broad selection? OK, I get that. Rate the brewery high, but not their beers. The IPAs balanced but boring compared to a lot of others that are out there, their flagships like this one included. And I find this one a little too fizzy. I like the taste more than the feel.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a very cloudy brass-orange body beneath a finger's width of pillowy off-white foam. The aroma is not as bright as I thought it would be having just sampled a Juli-ish, which is their lower gravity/alcohol version of this. I'm getting some sweetish malt that's grainy but not overly so as I can smell the oats as well. It's fruity with soft orange and peach. The flavor is bright, floral, citrusy, and otherwise fruity. I'm getting orange, mango, melon, peach, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine, but not as much as I found in the Juli-ish. I guess the little bit of extra malt here is covering it up. I will say that this is much better balanced and rounded though. It's got a median bitterness that keeps it in check across the palate and then leads to a dry finish. I should also note that I found a lot of ""hop bite"" in the smaller beer, but not as much here; that made it seem drier than this. There's not a lot of fruit lingering, but there is some, and it's a touch mineralish. Yeah, this is really nicely balanced. I could drink at least 4 of these in a row. How strong is it? Ahh, just 6.8%? Make that 6 in a row. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. Based on what I'd heard of this beer I was expecting a true juice bomb that tasted like orange juice but that's not the case, this is so creamy and smooth that it comes across like an orange-creamsicle.

I've been curious about this popular and highly rated beer, and I'm glad my curiosity has been satisfied. It certainly earns its reputation for greatness.

Holy. Fucking. Hell. I’m finally having this beer, and my lucky review #777. This beer is the result of my first beer trade ever, thanks to the incredible fo5s. Much appreciated bro, I’ve had this marked as a want on here for just about 3 years. This is the #1 fruit Lambic, and has been for quite some time. It currently sits at #17 overall, and I can’t think of a better beer for my personal #777 as a very highly regarded apricot Lambic. I actually have a few trades going for different vintages of this, with updated reviews to come. Alright, I know that was a lot of numbers, let’s just get into it now

Pours an opaque pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This smells absolutely heavenly. Even with over a year of age on it the fruit hasn't faded like some say that it has. I'm assuming it's more prominent in a fresher batch, but it's wonderful here too. I'm picking up on aromas of jammy dried apricot, white wine vinegar, sharp oak, aged leather, white grape, earthy wheat, doughy malt, light pepper, and lemon rind

This is unreal in taste as well, and not nearly as sharply sour as the aroma would suggest. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting juicy apricot, underripe peach, wheat bread, straw, pear juice, lemon rind, and light oak. The swallow brings notes of jammy dried apricot, sharp oak, white wine vinegar, peach rings, lemon rind, crackery malt, lime juice, and old leather

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp and tart beer. Finishes mostly dry but leaves a slight film behind on the tongue from the residual sugars

I honestly think this might be the one of the best beers I've ever had. Everything is so nuanced but flavorful at the same time. The 6% abv keeps it beyond drinkable, almost crushable, but that is not what I wanna do with this beer. I'm gonna cherish every last drop of this one. With the others I get, I'll see how it develops over time. Another massive shoutout to fo5s for this one. Cheers BA!",4.7

Assassin,"On tap at Ansari's in Eagan MN the other day (the 2021version). Was very excited to see this beer on tap, even at the price point ($14.99 for a 4 ounce pour).

The beer poured the expected blackish brown color, with minimal lacing and not much in the way of head retention. Still, I didn't think this was particularly unusual for a ba impy stout. On the nose, I'm picking up dark chocolate, light licorice, some vanilla and a hint of cherry. Not really getting much of any bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this moderately sweet stout, but with a slight roasty component as well. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is pretty long. As others have noted, there's some sort of odd flavor in the finish. It's not bad, just unusual (a slight wet cardboard flavor). Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, which I appreciate.

This is a nice beer no doubt, but the accolades this beer garners is a bit of a head scratcher. Likewise, the price tag for this beer is a puzzler as well. I ordered 3 ba impy stouts at Ansari's, and the Assassin was clearly low man on the totem pole (a ba coconut stout from 608 brewing from Wisconsin was vastly superior to the Assassin). Whatever. Each to their own. This is still a pretty good impy stout, but given the ""value quotient"" for this beer, I'm pretty sure this isn't something I'll ever need to order again.",4.21
Assassin,Bottle: Poured a pitch-black color sottu with a large dark brown foamy head with good retention and some alcing. Aroma of woody bourbon notes with some light vanilla and residual sugar notes with some black chocolate notes and roasted malt notes also quite dominant.

Body is full with a nice oily texture and good carbonation with some warming alcohol notes. Nice late night sipper.,4.48

Westly,Fantastic golden hue and white foam head that emits a fresh apricot orchard like aroma. The aroma is a burst of freshly cut apricots and a hint of funk.

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Appearance - The beer was solid black in appearance with little carbonation rising to the tan head.

Smell - The nose was very coffee forward with the barrel being detectable as well. It was not overly sweet.

Taste - At the front, there was a generous taste of coffee. It was blended with a soft chocolate presence. There was a sweetness that brought to mind marshmallow or vanilla, but it was not overly sweet or cloying. Tour the back, the sweetness combined with the mellowed heat of the bourbon.

Mouthfeel - The feel was soft and slick, with light carbonation.

Overall - This was a well designed beer that I would welcome the opportunity to sample again.",4.65

Speedway Stout - Vietnamese Coffee - Bourbon-Barrel Aged,"Great beer with a stellar coffee profile.

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 5 - I'm constantly impressed with AleSmith nailing the ratios. It's perfect stout:barrel:coffee.

Pliny The Elder,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. Head retention is good.

Smell: It has strong grapefruit and citrus aromas with some floral elements. There are very low stone fruit elements with a touch of grainy sweetness.

Taste: It has strong grapefruit and citrus flavors with some floral elements. It is very fruity with some light berry notes.

Feel: It is smooth and incredibly hoppy and bitter without any sharp bitter notes.

Pliny The Elder,"Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin sticky head with medium bubbles. Hard for me to get a sense of an aroma from this brew.

Tastes of bitter grapefruit, hops and orange zest.

Leaves sticky, layered lacing. Very hoppy going into the finish.

Overall great beer, not too heavy on anything, decent bitterness but not too overwhelming. I can definitely taste the hype.",4.14
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden color, medium carbonation. A silky, frothy foam head. Leaves behind sticky lacing.

Aroma: A sweet, pungent hoppy aroma. Fragrant floral, citric, piney, and some herbal notes present.


Taste: A good, complex flavor profile. Starts off with a balanced blend of citrus rind, pine resin and grapefruit, and then evolves into a notable lingering tangy bitterness in the middle with some tropical fruits. All the while, subtle malts in the background compliment the whole thing, keeping it in composition. The bitterness rides all the way through the somewhat boozy finish.

Overall: This is a unique brew to say the least. Layer after layer, the aroma and flavor complexity played a game of hockey with my senses.",4.56
Pliny The Elder,"Tasted on tap at Native Son Ale house in Rancho Cucamonga, CA.

L - Served in a clear plastic Solo cup due to the bar’s location inside a giant food court with outdoor patios. Light golden color with a touch of chill haze. Pure white head started out fluffy and a finger thick, but quickly faded to little more than a ring around the glass. Head may have been impeded by the plastic cup.

S - Again the cup may have lessened the impact of the nose, as it was hard for me to get much. Nice DIPA aromas of citrus and pine with some sweet, bready malt at a lower level. Not overly distinctive nose, but hits the right notes for the style.

T - Explosion of West Coast hops, with orange and grapefruit citrus notes, along with pine resin. Maybe a hint of pineapple. A light touch of bready malt that quickly fades in the surprisingly dry finish. The beer lacks enough malt to begin to balance against the hops, as I normally expect in the style.

F - Medium body and medium to high carbonation. Monstrous hops bitterness level that burns the citrus into your tongue. Alcohol heat is hard to pick out behind the hops burn. Very dry finish that leaves the hops aftertaste to linger.

O - I was very glad to finally try this beer after years of hype but not having any opportunities in Florida or in my travels. Is it a great beer? Certainly. Is it a world’s best, or an aging example? I won’t get into that debate. I can only say that, for my palate and preferences, this lacks in malt character to stand out as an Imperial IPA. To me it is more properly called an assertive West Coast IPA, and a great one, and I’ll leave it at that.",4.43
Pliny The Elder,"Wow, have seen some sub 4 reviews of Pliny....wawhat??!! This is by far one of the best beers out there. Regardless of your hoppy beer type preference being pale ale, IPA, or stout, this DIPA will knock your socks off both with its wonderful taste as well as its effect. Pop this beer open fresh (I have only had it bottled...not on tap or canned) outta a cold fridge and get your nose on it for some wonderfully floral and hoppy aromas. At 8% this DIPA is strong and one 17.5oz bottle will set most right requiring a brief 20 min interlude before standing up quickly/getting behind the wheel to hop to the next tasting room/bar. If I could keep a constant stock of Pliny the Elder available in my fridge I would, but alas it is a rare find down here in San Diego. Should have bought a case while I had the chance while at the high-end uber boujee Seaside Market in Cardiff-by-the-Sea. Maybe they have some left....hmmmm...I'll be back!",5.0
Pliny The Elder,"Pliny is synonymous with California beer. Whether it be the Elder or the Younger, the name is a brand within itself. We found the Elder hanging around Lake Tahoe and gave him a go. The crisp, punchy, and herbaceous ale fills the glass with a heady aroma. It is an honest beer and sometimes that is all you need.",4.5
Pliny The Elder,"Had on tap. Looks slightly hazed gold color with 2 finger white head of soft foam. Head fell to a cap after a few minutes. Left some nice lacing in the glass. Smell was all hops. A lot of tropical and citrus fruit is in the aroma. Taste enters sweet with a healthy dose of grapefruit, orange, mango. Middle has a bit of pithy bitterness and more tropical flavors but its balanced by a nice malt backbone. Finish is balanced with a slight hint of alcohol. Feel is medium bodied, lower carbonation but enough to provide a solid base for the flavor. Overall, well worth the wait for this classic expression. The flavors were bold, bright, and expressive. The beer was well balanced even with the bold hop presence. I enjoyed this a lot.",4.74
Pliny The Elder,"Long time coming. I have been wanting to get my hands on this beer for a few years. If you know me, I love imperial stout, barleywine and double ipa. If it's not full bodied then probably not gonna rate very high on my list. This brew poured a very light tan with a thin head. Nose was very happy and floral. Mouthful was very light with little malt backbone. I was dissatisfied with the taste of a beer that is rated 100. Maybe 15 years ago but with the evolution of craft beer I find it hard to fathom this beer in the top 50 all time. I would rate it 3 out of 5. Just like Hopslam this beer is overhyped and in my opinion not worth all the accolades. Of I were to taste it on draft the outcome could be different, but like I said I prefer full bodied brews and lean towards other styles. So take it for what it's worth.

Cheers. TBB.",3.19
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Very slightly hazy gold, nice carbonation, good head.

Smell: Strong grapefruit, slight rind.

Taste: Moderately sweet to start, then a balancing shot of grapefruit bitterness. Stays balanced between sweet and bitter before the bitterness wins out in the finish.

Overall: Bottled 7/18, tasted 8/13. Bought in Colorado and brought back, a long-time want finally obtained after 26 hours of driving round trip (I did do other stuff on this trip, not just beer shopping). Just a classic flavor, nice balance but plenty of hoppy bitterness. Definitely worth the trip.",4.55
Pliny The Elder,"Appearance: Clarity is clear, silky head, laces the glass throughout the session and has a long lasting head retention. Perfect pale/bronze color.

Aroma: Hop forward aroma as expected, but not deep or complex with a light malty sweetness in the background.

Mouthfeel: The body is a thin to medium body, solid carbonation that sings on the tongue, small alcohol warmth.

Flavor: Complex hop characteristics, gives small citrus flavor off from hops with some black currant like flavors and a solid touch of pine and a touch of floral/perfumy like flavors, from the bittering to flavoring hop additions. Small sweetness from the malt flavor to act as the backbone. Long lasting hop bitterness sticks with you after each drink that is still pleasant to enjoy.

This is a solid and most importantly classic/quintessential West Coast style IPA and shows exactly the path from the old school IPA 2000s vibes with the heavy magnum bittering. This beer shows the depth of hops from each stage of the beer making process to give deep complexity to the hop flavor.",4.4

A- Golden-orange body capped with a 1/2 finger off-white head. Awesome thick lace left on the glass. Retains at a thin foam.

S- Grapefruit and Topical scents with a sugary doughy backbone. Robust and fresh. Leafy hops, tobacco, resin and herbs as it opens up.

T- Great balance of grapefruit hops up font. Doughy and sweet cracker malts in the middle like honey whole wheat. Grapefruit and herbal spicy black pepper hop finish. A little aspirin.

M- medium full body. Crisp. Hoppy bite.

Pliny The Elder,"Poured from a 17.25 FL Oz bottle, bottled on 6-14-2022 so a month and 16 days old. Poured into spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a white nearly three finger head forms after a minute or two it slightly recedes making more room to pour, and I am able to get the head over the rim over the glass. Head becomes quite rocky but has very good retention. Carbonation after the pour looks quite ligjt and lazy. Body is a slightly dark gold. On the paler side of a lot of IPAs and with a very slight chill haze. Laces very nicely.

Aroma is quite bright with a hit of resinous grapefruit sweet hops. Some malt sweetness comes through, but the hops are very big on this one. A very sweet floral and citric smelling beer. Nothing off and very clean. More juicy than I expected.

Taste is similar to the aroma but a lot of the fruity qualities are traded for a big wave of bitterness that slowly fades leaving a resinous zesty but sweet and malty finish that lingers but is very nicely balanced after the big wave of hops. Despite the abv I can't really detect alcohol as the hops actually cover it up. Despite being super hoppy this isn't a mess and is very drinkable with a nice hop evolution that gives a good balance of bite to flavor.

Feel is soft and dangerously drinkable with a perfectly balanced carbonation bite to softness provided by the head. Honestly this is tasty af and I'm not an ipa guy nobody does everything right and maintains the balance. This feels like a benchmark and I could drink this all summer long if it wasn't 8% and so damn expensive.

Overall this beer is very hyped up. Don't get me wrong it's very good. There's essentially nothing wrong with it, the bitterness isn't cloying, but is pleasantly present, and it's big and hoppy without forgetting its a malt drink. It even looks beautiful. It's the perfect IPA, but everyone is trying to imitate it so unless this is you're whale you probably have a general idea of how this tastes, you've just had a similar but inferior beer. Is it worth the price? Maybe maybe not though. $7.99 for the bottle at a store in Colorado. Maybe I got scammed.",4.35
Pliny The Elder,"Comes in a crystal clear golden color, with a creamy, marshmallowy bright white head. Incredible retention with sheets of lacing.
The aroma doesn't explode from the glass, but it's nice. Earthy and piney, with pithy grapefruit. Think forest floor, littered with grapefruit peels. Potting soil, pine needles, pine cone, grapefruit peel, a touch of grass, and orange peel.
Juicy yellow grapefruit, and bright fresh white pine hit in equal measure. Grapefruit and orange peels and juice take over and dominate, but earthy pine needles remain in the background. The malt is subtle, biscuity, slightly toasty, offering a slight sweetness but remaining subtle. It finishes clean and crisp, moderately bitter. Hop oils, grapefruit and pine linger on your tongue and make the palate sticky.
Nice medium-plus body, good carbonation, moves quickly and smoothly on the palate but leaves a lasting impression.

This is every bit a world-class WCDIPA. Tastes phenomenal.",4.82
Pliny The Elder,"The look is clear straw to golden with a nice off-white head. Lots of nice lacing.
Aroma is piney and malty with a little dank to it. Taste is lightly fruity, piney, slightly sweet and moderately bitter. The mouthfeel is very nice with good carbonation, and a dry finish. Overall a delicious west coast IPA.",4.4
Pliny The Elder,"Man, I have been trying to get a hold of this for awhile now. Finally got to try some this week. I wanted so badly to love it! Man is this stuff overrated. Unbelievable. It is a delicious beer, don't get me wrong. But as they haven't changed the recipe (I don't think) this stuff IMHO is not worth seeking out if you've had all of the good stuff. You will be underwhelmed. It is a piney, resinous, hoppy west-coast IPA. I found it to be a glorified Sierra Nevada Torpedo.",4.28
Pliny The Elder,"Absolute stunner. I will never understand other reviewers that claim this beer is in the past. Would you dare poop poo on a Tree House New England style IPA for being stuck in the past? For some reason only pioneer West Coast IPA's get this treatment for their style, never the pioneers of hazy IPA's of the Northeast. This beer is extremely well crafted and balanced, while punching a piney flavor burst to your jaw. Everything about this screams well balanced while adhering to the West Coat style. And whaddya know, this beer invented the damn West Coat Imperial Ipa Style!

I will say, their only competition would be Alvarado atm, along with Cellarmaker.

There's a couple up and comers. Another OG would be Boneyard brewing who took a malt heavy approach for their beers and somehow, they kept their integrity after the buyout and do have the price advantage over Russian River. Bay Area beer heads are blessed with those two and Cellarmaker, BareBottle, Revision, and Field Works, to go along with the San Diego breweries that make their way up there.",4.72

Pliny The Elder,"Took nearly 20 years to finally get ahold of a bottle, and this one is reasonably fresh, bottled 4/25/22. So, almost exactly 6 weeks from bottling.
Nice fresh aroma with a nice mix of scents with fruit and freshness and herbs and sweetness. More golden than many with a slight haze. Nice dense white head that settles some with some lacing.
Boy, those are some nice flavors. The bitterness level being high is certainly old school and a little more than I want, but it's not ripping my tongue off either. Hops are so fresh on this and almost clean. Flavors are a little more herbal and grassy than the aroma but still some nice fruit qualities as well.
Body is only a little bigger than moderate but there is nice smoothness and richness that makes the feels soft and full. Not really sticky though.
This is good. And certainly worth the time it took to finally get one. I like the ""cleanliness"" of this. Not sure how else to describe it.",4.3
Pliny The Elder,"Poured from a bottle (bought in early Feb 2022) into a pint glass.

A: Clear, bright, straw yellow body. Frothy white head that sticks to the glass and leaves complex lacing.

S: Probably the best part. Very bright. A perfect blend of pine, mellow citrus, tropical fruit, and honey. It’s actually perfect.

T: The Simcoe hops really shine through here. A tad bit sweet and bitter but extremely well balanced. Does not leave a bitter or a cloying aftertaste. Fresh and sunny like morning dew on a pine tree.

o) So glad to enjoy a week of Pliny on vacation.",4.64
Pliny The Elder,Was lucky enough to be at Monk's in Philadelphia when they threw this on. Pours clear gold. Smells piney resin and a little sweet tropical.

CBS (Canadian Breakfast Stout),"Obtained a 4 pack for $35 at my local stout store. Couldn't believe they had it, i haven't seen it anywhere else, so even though there was a steep price to pay i just had to try it. Poured out a deep dark brown with a light tan head that lingered long after i poured it. In fact, several minutes after i poured it there remained a frothy loft of bubbles just waiting for me to taste it. Smell is not too strong. Not strong at all in fact. Very weak. Not what I look for in a beer. I usually want at least some kind of scent, but i've poured this into a snifter and swirled it around a good deal and still receive barely anything. Am i losing my sense of taste or have i just become accustomed to stronger beers? Well whatever nevermind i'll try a sip. A little bit of nuttiness, a little bit of caramel and toffee, a little bit of molasses, a little bit of coffee, a little bit of chocolate, but it's all just a little bit. i'm not certain what's supposed to be the dominant note here. i don't really get what they're truly going for. Usually there should be at least one taste that's predominant, but i'm getting a flat wash of not really much of anything except muted tones of what it claims to have. Aged on maple syrup it says, bourbon it says, well hell i'm not getting much of either. There is a sweetness to it, but it's kind of a flavorless sweetness. Did i get a bad bottle? How could this be rated a 100? I look for deep, dark, strong, bold flavors and this has none of that. Mouthfeel is light and sparkly, probably the best part about this beer. Overall, i'm rather disappointed. I can't believe i spent so much on this flavorless effort. I've had a LOT of brews that have been barrel aged, flavored with coffee and chocolate and maple syrup, but this just doesn't deliver. What's the hype? I'll stick to Hoppin Frog who knows how to get it right. I thought this would be a smooth slow sipper but i'm tempted now to just slam it, get the buzz, and call it a night. So disappointed.

Look: Pours a golden-brownish orange with a pillowy white head that dissipates rather quickly leaving a good amount of lacing. Floaters all over the place.

Smell: Piney, resiny, somehow woody and slightly smoky. Also sweeter notes of melon and gummy bears.

Taste: Less intense, more balanced, but all the notes which can be smelled can also be tasted. Resiny body with notes of sweet melon and burnt caramel, and something woody and smoky popping up here and there. Medium sweetness followed by an intensely bitter finish.

Feel: Clean and full at the same time. Medium carbonation. Quite crushable.

Overall: Very complex west coast style IIPA that combines a typical piney and woody body with different kinds of sweetness. Some unexpected notes (smoke, gummy bears) are also in the mix, but everything fits in seamlessly. I‘d definitely locate this one somewhere close to Heady Topper and Pliny the Elder.

Well damn, my first Hill Farmstead beer and it’s the 35th highest rated beer on BA! I know they’re more known for their Saisons, but I’m very happy to try this

Pours a hazy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

For the style, this isn’t super juicy in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of the overripe melon, lemon zest, bready malt, light caramel, peppery hops, fresh grass, and grapefruit rind

It’s a little more aggressive in taste but still feels more rustic than juicy and fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, tangerine, overripe melon, weedy hops, and light caramel. The swallow brings notes of grapefruit zest, orange juice, bready malt, peppery hops, fresh grass, and light tangerine

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a zesty yet creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry and very balanced

Holy shit, this is a great beer. Super unique for the style and so drinkable especially for the abv. I need more",4.48

A big blast of hops popped out of the can upon opening. Some citrus-orange scents, and some light frootiness. Very low grain presence.

Fairly similar on the tongue, with a bit of alcohol presence as well.

The body was fairly typical for the style, smooth and light.

Drinkability was good, especially sine the alcohol seemed to fade out a bit as it spent some time in the glass.

Bought at brewery, canned 12 days prior.
Brief, white head. Cloudy, medium orange, with a bit of amber on the side of the glass. Candied tangelo peel, mango, a touch of allspice and light caramelized malt, makes up the aroma. First ⅔ of taste is very good, with a candied tangerine peel, some mango and off-dry ( a wine term for nearly a complete lack of sweetness ), medium toasted, caramelized malts. As soon as these flavors fade, a sharp tangerine peel bite comes in and crowds out all else, for a long finish.",4.26
Abner,"Appearance - The beer was bright yellow in color with a bubbly white head that left generous lacing.

Smell - The nose was a bouquet of fresh lemons surrounded by dankness.

Taste - Initially, fresh but dry lemons led the profile. There was just a touch of sweetness like the East Coast style, but it was not liquid candy. The dankness really came through in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was nicely thick with an almost gritty body. Carbonation somehow survived the viscosity.

Overall - This is a great IPA, but I have had better.",4.51

It says to drink by 6/8/21, so is this almost old?! Either way, it’s still fantastic. It looks, smells, and feels world class. It’s one of the best balanced IPAs I’ve had in a really long time. I would have guessed this is a 6.5% abv and not 8.2%. I love the bitterness throughout. Not West Coast style, but East Coast hazy like. I’m so happy to try this guy and will drink my remaining cans before they’re officially old!",4.63
Abner,"I couldn’t be more lucky than to have fantastic neighbors willing to share a can of Hill F Abner. This was my first and right off the bat its smooth. Dare
I say there’s a creamy vanilla hint? The aroma is the classic fruity NE ipa. Is this really a dipa? Could not tell.",4.78
Double Sunshine,"Brewers Notes: This American double India pale ale is packed with juicy tropical fruit flavors and bright herbal aromas, thanks to the abundance of US-grown hops.


College soccer match takes me to within 20 miles of this brewery and gives me the chance to nab this whale

“Finest freshest”

Fluffy three finger off white foam cap, good retention, settles to a thick puffy island with good lacings over a translucent amber liquid with numerous active carbonation streams

Aroma is orange citrus , whiff of the tropics and some mango

Taste is citrus grapefruit, grapefruit rind

Sudsy mouthfeel , hop bite , we’ll balanced

Good beer , worth the hunt",4.5
Double Sunshine,"Every super hero has a skill, they have a talent, they have a gift. They have the ability to do something that no one else can do and they use it for good. Lawson's finest has a gift for hops and they do good bringing a double dose of their best efforts to the New England craft beer community.

Double Sunshine pours with a strikingly hazy and golden orange appearance. Looking the part of most hazy ale, the beer floats a creamy dense meringue of tarnish froth before enticing the nose with a brisk and brazen citrus scent with an herbal perfume of citronella in a ripe, roaring and racy tone. Deliciously smooth and velvety in its malty upstart, the early palate is met with cereal, honey, caramel and cream.

As the malts settle on the palate, the hops simply begin to blossom with a bounty of branch-ripe Valencia orange, tangerine, mandarin and blood orange while inviting more fruits of nectarine and mango to add even more racy flavors. Red grapefruit tighten its hop taste as a late plunge into juicy notions of sherbet and push-ups. Trending firmly bitter with smooth pine, fragrant woods, citrus peel and herbal and a slightly dank vegetal bite.

Medium-full in body, the beer's bold flavors and creamy upstart finishes remarkably dry and resinous. A long but smooth bitterness is lasting with fruit peels and herb for a session that's classically hazy up front and traditionally bitter to finish- a best of both worlds.",4.7
Double Sunshine,"Canned 8/10/22.

L: Pours a clear orange gold with a big creamy white head that thins on top but sticks around the glass. Lacing is splotchy and irregular but pretty.

S: Surprising juicy fruit aroma, more similar to Sip than expected. A touch of grapefruit and herb.

T: More juicy fruit up front, pivoting to grapefruit in the middle, with a dry and slightly bitter finish. No heat.

F: Medium mouthfeel. Appropriate carbonation.

O: Combines some of the best elements of new school juiciness and old school clarity and bitterness. Well crafted.",4.37
Double Sunshine,Exceptional! Stopped at their brewery for the first time yesterday. No idea it was even there and turned around. Really glad I did. Tried two short pours as I was driving and tired. I love Sip and this is head and shoulders better in my opinion. It’s right up there with any beer in the country. Well done Lawson’s,4.58
Double Sunshine,Pours clear as a lager (or old school IPA). Love that we still have delicious IPAs that are not turbid. Aroma of citrus grapefruit. I’m glad the grapefruit isn’t too much taste-wise. Citrus hops with the grapefruit in the background. Perfect creamy mouthfeel. Great beer.,4.47
Double Sunshine,"Pours a lightly hazy reddish golden with soapy white head. Some overripe mango and expressed grapefruit peel on the nose. A touch of mango but mostly citrus forward. Grapefruit is the central flavor that comes to mind. It's sticky, sappy, chewy. The chewiness of this is really what I'm enjoying the most. I remember this being much more tropical and less citrus forward when I had had it before but those are blurry memories from beer festivals and my palate memory is much more developed now than it was at that time. However, this is still a really nice DIPA that doesn't really have any rough edges.",4.36
Double Sunshine,"Look - great golden clear color with nice white head and great lacing
Smell - citrus dank herbal
Taste - about the same but dialed back, almost like orange peel with a slight lemon
Feel - medium full body with a medium carb
Overall - really fantastic",4.33
Double Sunshine,"Small but lasting head. Some streaks for lace. Darker gold color. Clear.

Light earthiness. Some spiciness in the form of nutmeg or cinnamon. Good pale malt base, slightly sweet.

Drier than the smell. The body leans rich but the carbonation is also elevated. The hop bitterness shows up just prior to the swallow. The finish is approaching astringency. The hop is similar To black pepper. The aftertaste draws out some warmth from the alcohol. Surprisingly easy to drink with a good blend of all of the elements throughout the tasting.",4.34
Double Sunshine,"Quick review, can purchased at brewery:
Mostly clear with strong lacing; Nose is a bit light, fruity; taste starts a little sweet, with a hint of burn, but balances quickly and then slowly becomes bitter. The Transition is nice, only mild complaint is I wish is started just a little less bite. Awesome beer, and I'm mostly finding smaller detractions to bring it down from perfect.",4.77
Double Sunshine,"I finally got this up in Vermont this summer. I was expecting too much from it based on other people's ratings. I actually prefer SOS to the double. Don't get me wrong, this is a great DIPA, but I am getting bitter taste from the hops rather than the sweet taste I get from SOS. I love how this beer is clear, amber from the delicious malt, well-carbonated, and easy to drink.",4.41
Double Sunshine,"Pours a clear crisp orange-yellow color with a thick but airy white colored head that laces nicely on the way down. Aroma of floral hops, earthy smells and some sweet malts at the end of it. Tastes of toasted malts, nice earthy and slightly citrus hops and a warming alcohol feel at the back end. Thicker feeling than it looks, warming, nice amount of carbonation. Overall, this is what I miss about Double IPAs made in New England.",4.46
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle, poured into a New Glarus glass at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours a clear bright ruby-garnet red, at least for the first pour. Forms a thin, fizzy, short-lived white head that swiftly dies to a ring.

S: The nose is all tart raspberries, with some soft oak tannins wafting in the backdrop.

T: Sharp, tart, sour raspberries, with just a slight tang beneath of oak.

F: Light, and not terribly lively.

O: Definitely framboise to the core, with a du Fermier acidity.",4.45
Framboise Du Fermier,"Look - Just beautiful! Bright purplish red fairly clear till you pour the bottem of the bottle in the glass. Great white head and lacing
Smell - tart raspberry lots of barrel and tart with some earthy notes
Taste - tart raspberry slight sweet but dry with a great oak
Feel - medium full body with a medium fizz carb slight cream
Overall - just fantastic and super tartness with a ton of raspberry",4.53
Framboise Du Fermier,"Pours a dull, matte pink that resembles the fresh of grapefruit. No foam on this bottle pour. Pour is from the bottom 1/3 of the bottle. Aroma is strong raspberry (had it all caps in my notes). Stone and grass add depth, before a tart finish dries out the nose and cues a sip. Flavor profile is raspberries through and through. Stone, grass, and grapefruit round out each sip. It's sweet, then tart. Mouth feel is creamy with a mild silt throughout. Thickness is medium-thick, coming in on the more full side of saisons. Overall, a plump, ripe saison jammed up and full of raspberries.

Bottle pour. Reviewed from notes.",4.61
Framboise Du Fermier,"750 ml bottle today. Poured a deep and dark ruby color. Beautiful beer in the glass. Instant aroma of raspberries. Very fragrant. Smells fruity and tart. Flavor was full of raspberry with some acidity and a hint of vinegar. A real treat though. Great body for the style. Good carb too. Overall, outstanding iteration of a fruited saison. Took a long time for me to track this one down and would do it again.",4.6

Framboise Du Fermier,"Pouted from a 750 mL bottle. The color is very pretty dark red hazy color. The aroma is a bit of funk with a big explosion of raspberry, love it. The taste follows the smell with the typical SP acidity and a big raspberry flavor, super jammy. Its an awesome beer and tasty nonetheless.",5.0
Framboise Du Fermier,"First of all, the smell. Wow! Hits your nose and you don’t want to pour it, drink it out of the bottle! My friend I’m drinking it with said it tastes like a raspberry Flintstones vitamin. It’s a great one no doubt!",4.75
Morning Wood,"22oz bomber bottle. most likely a 2019 bomber based on the listed abv of 11% on the bottle, but was told this was a 2018 vintage of Morning Wood.

Poured into Durobar Charente glass.

Appearance: black bodied beer with dense and thick off white to light brown head that is uneven with lots of large soapy looking bubbles. Light lacing. good staying power. Thick ring remains around the outside of the glass as the head eventually dies down.

Smell: Big maple and oatmeal with a hint of cinnamon, smokey bacon and a hint of coffee. Hints of chocolate, oak, and bourbon.

Taste: Immediately big maple syrup flavored oatmeal just like what was found in the nose. Bacon and meaty smoke integrated nicely with a gentle ashy barrel char in the middle that is quite enjoyable. Hint of Dad's brand root beer candies and cola. Finish has lots of rich bourbon notes and chocolate notes. This is complex, superbly balanced, and flat out really really tasty. Easily exceeds my expectations for sure.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low and adequate carbonation levels. Slightly silky and creamy bodied porter. Very smooth and not any booze at all.

Overall: Finally! Pretty excited to get to tick this barrel aged porter thanks to TATURBO. This beer is rich without being overly sweet. The barrel notes are spot on and it really is hard to find anything wrong in this beer. Just the right amount of maple which is a flavor that is easy to overdo. The balance is also quite impressive as well. Put this beer on your must try list if you haven't. Breakfast flavors galore with a splash of bourbon and oak. What's not to like? The barrel aging definitely improves maple bacon coffee porter which is a hard feat to achieve. Nice work here from Funky Buddha for sure.",4.59
Morning Wood,"Damn, the minute I opened this I was punched in the face with maple - it is clear that age has not diminished the maple presence at all ... In terms of appearance it pours a shiny black color. A lovely velvety head forms on the beer with solid head retention. It is pretty viscous. Back to the aroma - it is dominated by the maple syrup with underlying notes of smoky bacon, oak, bourbon, and chocolate. All of those aromas are quite strong - so I am not really getting much in the way of coffee.

Taste follows the nose and is very much dominated by the maple syrup flavor, but the surprising part is that it is not at all as sweet as I remember from having this in the past. There is much more roasted malt, chocolate, smoked malts with some slight meaty notes, and the bourbon barrel comes through more strongly. Some slight roasty bitterness comes through on the back end. Feel is thick, full bodied and luscious. Moderate carbonation. Sort of drier on the finish.",4.53
Morning Wood,On tap at Castaways for the tap takeover. Dark brown pour with a kaki head. Loads of maple and bourbon aromas. The taste follows suit with pronounced black coffee and dark roasted malts. Hints of oak. Good body and mouthfeel.,4.5

T: roasty coffee, chocolate malt, maple/brown sugar, Slight smoke and/or bitterness. No bacon specifically.
F: medium.
Overall: Very good porter. Hard to distinguish between this and a stout. Maple sweetness and coffee dominate. Reminds me of beers I recently had... mornin’ delight, kbbs, cbs, and that’s a pretty high compliment considering their ratings. Clearly world-class barrel aging going on.",4.65
Morning Wood,"I got this in a trade, and the date is smudged off :-(

Appearance: Poured 1/4th of a glass every time so not too much head. Pitch black of course. Some lacing.

Aroma: Impressive -- maple, coffee, and smoke all shine through.

Flavor: Overall sweet almost like a milk stout. Maple syrup throughout, strong coffee throughout as well. Milk chocolate. The barrels come through if you pay attention. There's a slight smokiness on the back end, which is such a great addition. There is absolutely no heat. The advertised flavors do not lie... however I don't get much more than that. Not a bad thing but perhaps was hoping for more.

Palate/Finish: Medium but oily and sticky. Very smooth, no carb. I do wish this was thicker, but I also realize that this is a porter so I won't knock it too much. Finishes with more coffee and sticky maple.

Overall: This is a very good beer and it deserves some accolade. I was hoping for something to 'chew' on, but at the same time, the style *is* porter, and I do admire that. The alcohol is completely hidden, and the maple/coffee flavors shine so well in the flavor and in the aroma. This is what impressed me most. On the other hand, it's not the most complex imperial porter I've had, and it's a little lactos-y. Overall, I'm gonna say this is an A beer, but not an A+.",4.44
Morning Wood,"Jet black body topped with a thick and creamy, tan colored head. Alluring aroma of milk chocolate, cocoa and vanilla; faint, boozy scent. Decadently rich, sweet flavors; milk chocolate and maple syrup; vanilla; whiskey. Heavy, silky smooth body; velvety and chewy; dull, prominent sweetness to the mouthfeel; twinge of alcohol warmth.

A heady, extremely tasteful and lip smacking bit of rich porter flavor. World class all the way...",4.74

L: Dark and beautiful as a porter should be. Great tan head with good lacing throughout the entire (short) life of the beer.
S: Slightly sweet and inviting. Maybe a hint of bourbon on the nose (but my nose is pretty weak in this area.)
T: This is my #1 beer so I personally feel that is is the best porter I've ever tried. I routinely buy every bottle I can find. Great taste that's slightly sweet without any alcohol burn/aftertaste. Smooth tasting with a hint of maple and bourbon. Best porter or stout I've had.
F: Everything a porter should be, smooth and silky with a clean and hearty feel in the mouth.

JJJuliusss!,Quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. Enjoyed this even more than the King. Accolades fail me at this level of perfection of the style. Effortless drinking and just pure unadulterated enjoyment. Thanks goodness this brewery is a long drive away or they would have all my money.,4.84
JJJuliusss!,"Canned on 7/29/22; consumed on 9/2/22

Pours a turbid, dark orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; excellent head retention leaves a finger of rich cap, a massive, fluffy collar, and myriad spattering of chunky lacing tossed around the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights mango gummies accented with a slight mustiness hinting toward a boggier overlay of guava peel and tropical compost over time; a dense, bready malt backing remains prevalent as light papaya and melon brings a soft freshness to the back end.

Taste offers mossy mango contrasting tangy orange juice upfront, with lingering guava engaging distant melon over the mid-palate while sweet, boggy-dank sensations flow alongside a lime-pineapple juiciness on the back end.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-full body and a moderate, rounded carbonation soon easing to resoundingly creamy, smooth textures; a juicy twang levels density past the mid-palate to an effortless, pillowy grit lingering on the finish.

A tropical hop smoothie, extensively creamy and leveled with weighty resins in-flux with the rampant saturation; a busy density attenuated to Tree House's usual high standard of NEIPA.",4.16
JJJuliusss!,"Look - bright orangish thick and creamy with a great white head and sticky lacing
Smell - super tropical citrus scents just jump out at you
Taste - super juicy but dry somehow. tropical citrus very fruity taste without being bitter at alll
Feel - medium full body with a creamy light carb
Overall - just loved this beer!",4.81
JJJuliusss!,"Appearance - The beer poured an unnatural shade of orange with a white head and generous lacing.

Smell - The nose had an orangey nose with a malty backbone.

Taste - The beer tasted more like orange juice than beer. It was like Sunny Delight got poured into a bitter IPA. There was a maltiness amid the body. Bitter orange rind lingered in the finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick!

Overall - Based on the description, I was expected the beer to be sweeter.",4.31
JJJuliusss!,"Tree House Brewing Co. ""JJJuliusss""
16 fl. oz. can coded ""JJJUST GGGREAT 04/29/22 07:48:00"". Sampled on 05/15/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The can that I have in front of me is labeled JJJuliusss without an exclamation point and the label is white, not orange, but I'm pretty sure this is the same beer. The question is, what is it? I get all of these Julius beers confused. Ahh, this is Julius with extra hops added, first brewed for their 3rd anniversary. It's poured a very cloudy orange body beneath a finger's width of creamy off-white foam. As is the case with all Treehouse beers the head holds up really well and it leaves some very nice lacing about the glass. That hasn't happened yet but I can tell that it will based on experience. The aroma is fruity but also malty. It's sweetish and grainy with notes of orange, peach, and mango. I wish I had a Julius to compare it to but I drank them all! Ha ha! The flavor delivers that sweetish malt and I can taste the oasts in it. It's threaded through with notes of orange, peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, and lime. There's some resin to it, and a touch of pine. It's got a median bitterness but also a lot of acidic ""hop bite"" that balances it and eventually leads to a dry finish where resin and pine linger. In the mouth it's medium bodied but fluffy and smooth due to all of the extra proteins. As expected the head held up well and I now have craggy rings of lacing throughout the entire glass. I honestly can't say how much more aromatic or flavorful this is than the standard Julius but I think I enjoyed it more. I'll have to try to get a hold of more of both to do a side-by-side.
Review #7,971",4.44
JJJuliusss!,"Pours a murky dark orange with two fingers of dense yellowed foam head. Great retention and thick rings of lacing.

Big orange in the nose. Hints of passionfruit, plum and gummy bears.

Same lovely mix of tropical fruits and orange citrus in the taste. A little herbal greeness and light pith in the finish creates some great balance that prevents the beer from being sweet.

Very soft, pillowy feel with restrained carbonation.

A top of class NEIPA. Tons of depth among the varied fruit flavors along with good light bitterness for balance.",4.38
JJJuliusss!,"One month old. Can to pint glass.

Look: Pours a full and hazy yellowish orange. Medium thick white head leaving a bit of lacing.

Smell: Orange. Grapefruit. Sweet and dank.

Taste: Ripe citrus fruits. Mostly orange, tangerine and grapefruit. Medium sweetness with a zesty, slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Full and juicy. Low carbonation. Slightly sharp.

Overall: Typical Tree House IPA which could easily be mistaken for a higher ABV DIPA (which is great). Rather edgy than smooth, but still nicely balanced. Overall a very good brew and a prime example of the style.",4.46
The Adjunct Trail - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"On tap for TBBW 2021 “Sorta Rad” Event.

2020 Vintage. Thick Nutella bomb. Crazy adjuncts, with coconut more restrained but really coming out on the tail. Barrel is great, with a roasty bitterness and touch of oak on the palate; good heat on the finish. If you like hazelnut this will blow your mind.",4.93
Dinner,Been waiting over a decade to try this beer and even longer to visit the brewery. Finally did both! Had it on draft and took a few bottles home with a date of 26AUG22. This absolutely meets the hype. Incredibly delicious and absurdly drinkable for the ABV and style. SO fruity and so floral. The smooth body and delicate mouthfeel are truly impressive. This is the real deal.,4.78
Dinner,"Pours a dirty darker straw color; cloudy but see through; white head that laces quite beautifully, a dense film lingers and lingers.

The aroma literally jumps out of the glass on this beer; it has an essential oil like brightness to it, incredibly vibrant. A mix of fresh in season fruits; nothing tropical to me just local summer fruits, but with an extra citrus like bite to it; a little bit of vegetal dank on the finish, it cuts short of onion garlic territory for me.

Taste is much of the same but the beer becomes less fruity more citrus, pithy, with a pretty nice minor sweet malt presence; slight resin/sap aftertastes.

This is a double IPA that is for sure; it has a pretty hefty body, higher end of medium. A very clean drinking beer, dry and biting bitterness on the finish, prickly sappy tingling on the tongue. Also letting you know this is a double IPA is the slight alcohol presence on the finish, no overbearing by any means but present.

Well it is easy to see why this beer has the reputation it does. The aroma alone is intoxicating but the flavors and feel combine to make this a very good beer; I love the bite and big hop presence on such an aromatic beer. Lovely beer.",4.47
Dinner,"I've never come across this highly regarded beer, so was pleasantly surprised to see it on tap when I was out to dinner last night. The appearance was that of.....beer. Cloudy and medium yellow, with almost no head. The lack of head could certainly be chalked up to the fact that it had probably been a minute or two between the pour and its arrival at my table. Regardless, while there was nothing wrong with the appearance, nothing particularly stood out either.

The nose was a different story. I'm desensitized to IPA aromas at this point, but this beer smelled amazing Loads of citrus, mango and other tropical notes. Simply an excellent smelling beer.

The taste was very nice, but not as tropical as the nose. Grapefruit was the only taste I could pick out, but whatever else was there it was above average, but didn't blow me away (keeping in mind I'm not a big lover of IPAs). The feel, however was amazing. Very full, creamy and pillowy. Absolutely excellent.

Overall, I though this was a very good beer, led by the aroma and the feel. I hope to be able to luck into some bottles sometime right around a NBS BIF so I can share it with others.",4.14
Dinner,"From a 16.9oz bottle, dated 07/29/22. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a just barely hazed honey-gold with two-plus fingers of pouffy, shaving cream-like foam. Retention is excellent, leaving a fat bubbly-sudsy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing.

Nose is sweet, malty, and layered with aromas of orange peel and pine needles.

Taste is as expected, leaning into the sweet and malty end of balanced. The earthy-woody pine needle, resinous character is prominent, along with caramel sweetness, oily orange peel and a squeeze of lemon.

Feel is clean, just a little too brisk to pass as smooth (entirely in a good way) and no more than medium bodied with bright, zesty carbonation. There’s a cheerful hop oily tingle on the tongue and a slight boozy warmth in the gullet.

As always when rating MBC bottles, overall score is marked down 0.25 in recognition of the stupid, overpriced pint-plus bottles. Because principles, right? (Replaces a 4.46 rating without a review from 11/05/15… thank you, Dr. J. for the rare opportunity to have this one again).",4.36
Dinner,"Just an amazing step up from Lunch. Another classic from Maine Beer Co. that really lets the tropical nature of the hops shine through. Where Lunch is a mellow, refined take on the style and very clean, Dinner is a punch in the mouth and in a good way.",4.79
Dinner,"On tap at Sabatini's in Exeter pa yesterday.

Looks very good in the glass. Honey yellow body with a nice white head. This eventually shrinks to a thin ring, good lacing early on.

Delightful hoppy aroma with a side of mixed fruit favoring the non citrus.

On tasting, smooth, hoppy, delicious. Fruit notes confirm the nose. Very easy drinking, abv fairly well hidden but you get the feel of it.

Mouth close to full, finish manages to be clean, but full of hop flavor.

Overall, have missed out on this one the last few times it was at Sabz. Not this time. Beautifully crafted dipa. Seemingly simple, but a lot of thought has gone into producing this classic.",4.49
Dinner,"Look - hazy thick golden copper color with a really nice white head that sticks around and leaves great rimming and lacing when drinking
Smell - classic hop top notch. Floral citrus slight pine slight caramel malt
Taste - class dipa with it's hop bitterness. Citrus floral pine like the smells with a slight booze.
Feel - full body and carb

Duck Duck Gooze,"Received from @dimidiata. Pours a bright golden color with a small amount of short-lived white head that receded to a thin ring. Fully translucent, almost clear. Aroma has tons of funk, well complemented by complex wine and barrel noted. along with lemon & dandelion. Overall a wonderful smelling beer.

Taste picks up right where the nose left off. I get apricots, wine barrel, apple vinegar, lemon, hay and general barnyard funk. Acidity is spot on. Tart, but it doesn't beat you over the head, allowing all the other wonderful flavors their time in the spotlight. Light bodied, bright, crisp and clean.

Overall, an absolutely wonderful beer.",4.47
Duck Duck Gooze,"2022 vintage

Review 1100!! I figured I’d bust out a special bottle for the occasion, and what’s better than the highest rated Gueuze on BA? Well, Gueuze-inspired I should say, based on recent thread. Whatever the fuck we wanna call it, I’m beyond excited to try this so let’s get into it

After a long and annoying struggle with the double cork breaking inside the bottle, it pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Wow, this is super bright in the nose, just an absolute. punch of funk. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon juice, sharp oak, old leather, wet hay, vinegar, apple skin, dried apricot, tart white wine (surprising given the red wine barrel aging), and general floral notes. Really all over the place but fantastic

While it's not as incredible in taste, it is still very damn good, just less sharp than you'd expect based on the aroma. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting wet hay, lemon zest, jammy apricot, white wine vinegar, pear, white pepper, dry oak, and light leather. The swallow brings notes of bright white wine, stone, lemon yogurt, orange juice, apple skin, straw, and light honey

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and zesty beer. Finishes very dry with a balanced tartness

Super annoying cork aside, this is a fantastic treat of a beer! There's something special about this one doing a very convincing Belgian impersonation, in the most flattering way. I need to get more to cellar, cheers BA!",4.57
Duck Duck Gooze,"the 2016 is on point right now. Very complex, sharp and interesting wine barrel aged sour. if you haven't had a chance it's very much worth seeking this beer out!",4.54
Duck Duck Gooze,"2016 Vintage

750ml corked and caged bittle - poured into a Riesling/Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

Pours a slightly foggy translucent honey-golden, really verging on orange, like a West Coast IPA. A finger of coarse, sticky, sudsy off-white head forms, with fair retention, and settling to a decent collar, with weak, spotty lacing. Clings to the glass like whiskey. Really a beautiful beer.

Nose: This one travels. No shortage of funk here. Tons of damp hay and wine-soaked oak, with plenty of bright lemon juice and rind. There's ample leather book binding, dusty stone cellar, petrichor, magnolia blossom, and a really dense note of patchouli, with some sweet apricot and marmalade threadinf through. Some funky stable, sea shell minerality, and sweaty brett emerge, but the funk is balanced by plenty of bright fruitiness. Huge nod to Cantillon here.

Palate: Duck Duck Gooze emerges with an impressively balanced acidity. Like biting into a ripe stone fruit, there's a bright *POP* of tartness, but it immediately steps back, becoming more of a lemony tang. Lemon oil, orange juice, apricot, and crabapple lend bright fruity notes, with undertones of cabernet grape, cranberry, unripe plum, and coriander seed. The tartness begins to rapidly subside, showing quite a bit of grain - dusty, with hulls. An almost Gueuze level of funk presents itself in the form of wet hay, damp wood, old musty stable air, milkweed, and a touch of herbal flowery notes with just a whisper of sweaty funk. The tartness completely disappears, and the finish shows wheaty grain, grass, lemon essence, white oak, and just a touch of grapefruit oil that clings to the palate.

Mouthfeel/Body: Absolutely stunning. It's crisp, airy, and quenchingly dry with a shimmering minerality, but there's definitely some soft body which lends presence. The effervescence is truly perfect. Champagne. Zippy, airy, fluffy, and fizzy, but soft and supple. An oily feel lingers.

Overall: This is perhaps the most stunning American wild ale I've had in a long time, perhaps ever. I'm not sure if this is Method Traditionelle or not, but either way, this really is a masterpiece. A sweet grain presence, incredibly balanced acidity, ample funk contrasting against beautiful bright fruity notes, and it all comes together so seamlessly and flawlessly, this has truly transcended the style itself. Simply stunning.",4.6
Duck Duck Gooze,"2016 release, enjoyed in 2020. Light orange-golden, unfiltered but pretty transparent and bubbly. No residual lacing. Bright and floral, quite tart on the first sip, but sweeter and fruitier after that. Apricot, peach, grapefruit, bits of cranberry and granny smith. Light straw and funk underneath the sourness.",4.75
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"Cradled 750mL bottle served in decanter, sat for ~20 minutes, then served into glass. Pours a rich burgundy color with a finger of pink foam. Aroma is cherry forward, but not in a fleshy, fruit forward way, instead delivering a rindy dark pit. It's morphs into notes of almond and cinnamon, with light tart cherry and stone just beyond. Complexity is notable, without any overtly sugary tendencies. Flavor profile delivers those same almond and cinnamon notes. Cherry is present, with a tart twist. Stone, followed by big lemon zest and grassy notes play the outro. Again, the complexity and depth is just amazing. For a beer blended with cherries, it develops much more nuance and thought beyond this single note. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a consistent grit throughout. It verges on bubbly, at least at the onset. Overall, cherry notes here are just a delight, swirling together with almond and cinnamon for a thought provoking sip. It refrains from every dipping into overtly tart or sour.

2018. Served from a 750mL bottle. Decanted. Reviewed from notes.",4.64
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"750 ml corked and capped bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Vintage 2007, ABV is 5%. 300 gram of Schaerbeek cherries are added per liter beer. Aged in oak barrels. Deep red colour, huge pink head. Intense aroma of ripe cherries, hints of red wine vinegar. Equally intense flavour of sour cherries, not as lemony as the Lou Pepe Framboise. Drank it a bit too cold, still refreshing and pleasant to drink.",3.99
Lou Pepe - Kriek,"I just had a cellered Lou Pepe Kriek from Cantillon bottled in 2010. I poured it into a snifter. I imagined myself being in the garden of a Belgian Brassiere while drinking it.

Look: dark reddish light brown with a thin white head

Aroma: cherry pie and red wine.

Taste: wheat/grain, tart and slightly sweet cherry, lots of cherry, some funk/vinegar, red wine and oak.

Body/Overall: medium body, soft/velvety, well balanced and delicious.",4.65
Very HHHazyyy,"Look...the usual impeccable staw yellow with a frothy well carbonated head
Smell...overripe peach and mango with citrus tropical fruity with yeast and dank.
Taste...Boozy explosion in a good way because the drying and the underlying drying and whirlwind of flavors seem to explode and dissipate. Very intricate layering of flavors. Melon, mango, and pineapple overtones. Absolutely drenched in hop sauce
Feel...a usual pillow juicy and sticky. Tons of lacing and full character yet so easy to drink
Overall..This beer kicks some serious butt. There is no way to lose trying this beer because the boys up in Chartlon are killing it as usual. Harder for me do to differentiate from Very Hazy but still different and good",4.5
Very HHHazyyy,"16oz can dated 5/27/22.

Pours cloudy yellow with plenty of tattered lacework and persistent retention. Peach, pineapple, and white grape in the nose. Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel.

Very HHHazyyy,"Appearance - The beer was golden orange with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The beer had an orangey nose, perhaps a slight vanilla hint.

Taste - Orange. There was some bitterness and perhaps a bit of lemon and melon. There was a little hint of vanilla. There was a lighter bitterness at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer was thick, and modestly carbonated.

Overall - This was the winning Tree House for the evening.",4.49
Very HHHazyyy,"a: super hazy matte pale orange color with a slight copper tinge. large, 3 finger solid, yet frothy, off-white head

s: the aroma hits you as soon as you pop the can. tangerines, guava, passionfruit, and pineapple. juicy mango, dragonfruit, and a hint of tangy peach juice. some crackers in here, and some mellow orange and grapefruit. extremely juicy

t: huge hit of fresh melon right away. tangerines, clementines, ripe mango, and peach behind that. guava and kiwi. papaya and some faint sweet pineapple. my goodness, this is very tasty

Taste peach, tangerine, papaya, passionfruit, and apricot really balanced and rather insane. 5

Mouthfeel is above average, not sticky or dry, soft creamy carbonation, and at 8.8% it has huge flavor but insanely drinkable. 5

Very HHHazyyy,"From a 16oz can dated 5/27/22 into a tulip. Can message: Beer...Beer...Beer...Diddly Beer...

Pours a thick opaque light yellowish, brownish orange with about two and a half fingers of slightly off-white head. Incredible retention and lacing.

Huge aroma. Smells of mangoes, mandarins, peaches and canteloupe. Some earth in the background on warming.

Taste is bitterness up front-earth and pine with juice in the background-citrus and mango. nice balance of juice and bitterness.

Soft, full-bodied, thick mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Citrus rind aftertaste.

Yeah, well, this is incredible. Incredibly balanced for a bigger beer.",4.61
Very HHHazyyy,"16 oz can. It says ""It had to happen"". Well so did this review.

Pours a muddy pale gold color with a finger of fluffy, effervescent white head. Smaller head than expected, but the retention is real. Leaves a massive crown of lacing along the top of the glass.

Oh my dear lord the smell of this beer. How is there no fruit puree here? There's a nuclear amount of stone fruit, as well as some fresh mango, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit pith. The signature Tree House yeast is also very present with a hint of vanilla.

The flavor follows the nose to a T, but adds a nice vanilla bean character, as well as some melon and fruit stripe bubblegum. This is just stupid.

The feel is medium-full bodied with lower carbonation. Creamy and pillowy soft. A hint of booze.

Overall, this beer is absolutely deserving of any hype it receives. I am a long admitted Tree House fanboy, but I'd consider myself well-versed with NEIPA's and can tell which ones are good and which ones are not, regardless of bias. This one is unquestionably good.",4.71
Very HHHazyyy,"Hazy is a good description of the look. The smell jumps out to you from 18” away persuading you to “drink me”. Taste is very pleasant, feels good in the mouth and going down. Love this beer.",4.61
Samuel,"Finally cracking this bottle after getting it in one of the HF home delivery programs many months ago. Pours less billowy than many of the HF offerings, with little head retention or lacing to speak of. This is a superbly well-rounded and nuanced offering, with all of the characteristics of a rustic saison, a fine effervescent white wine, and a barrel aged sour all-in-one, with no one attribute dominating the others. $60/750ml is very high, but this is barely over into 'worth it' territory

93/100",4.61
Samuel,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Mild vinous bouquet. Good stuff. Wine barrel gives way to tasty farmhouse notes. Not crazily complex but so solid, clean, and refreshing. A over average body and mouthfeel.",4.23
Samuel,"This one pours a golden and bright orange color, with a small fluffy head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like hay, minerally funk, lemon candy, grassy funk, honey, oak, white wine, grape, sweet floral funk, and pear skin.

This is absolutely phenomenal, and represents the best of what Hill Farmstead is capable of. The recipe appears to be a cross of two of my favorite beers that Hill Farmstead has ever done - Vera Mae and Le Sarrasin - so this beer has been on my list for a while now. It's got this wonderfully fresh and lemony taste to it, like funky lemon candy, with that rustic funk - pear, citrus, grassy, a little bit of herbal and mineral character, along with lots of oak spice. There's also an outstanding sweet floral honey-like flavor.

This is light bodied, effervescent, and very drinkable. Taking down an entire 750 of this one would be absolutely no problem.

This is in the top 3 of all Hill Farmstead beers I've ever had, and it's maybe even the best beer overall that I've ever had. It's honestly perfect.",5.0
Parabola,"2021 variant. Good viscosity on this. Great barrel. Just something missing on the back end. The beer pours very dark, with modest head, more than I was expecting. Nice aromas of chocolate, coffee & vanilla. I'd rate this above average, but expected more based on the ratings on here. Wouldn't run out to buy this again the way I searched this one out, but would gladly drink it if I was out and it was on tap or happened to be a bottle in the cooler.",4.29
Parabola,"This beer is nearly black in color. There is a modest head that persists, and there is a little bit of lace.
Aroma of cherry, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and a little booze.
Cherry taste, but taking a back seat to chocolate fudge and espresso coffee. Some vanilla in the taste, and some bourbon.
A big, slow-sipping beer.",4.68

Parabola,"Just opened a 2017 vintage.
Dark brown, almost black. So dark it absorbs the light! Thin head but maintains a lacy ring around the rim. Bourbon and coffee aromas, with flavors of dark chocolate, coffee, Bourbon, vanilla and brown sugar. Slightly oaky, but not overdone at all. Very thick and lingering finish. Good stuff.",4.71
Parabola,"2021 bottle:

Appearance: Black, thin head.

Smell: Rich, chocolatety, boozy, wood, vanilla.

Taste: Really thick and coating right away. Big vanilla barrel note that transitions to rye spiciness. Chocolatety and mild sweetness. Kind of separates into beer and barrel factions before coalescing again by the end of the glass.

Overall: Sort of a whale for me, I've been wanting to try for years and finally FW sent some to MN. Very thick stuff, tasted great then kind of had an awkward phase of “here's beer” and “here's barrel” before coming back together as a unit. Tasty stuff!",4.47

Parabola,"Growler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, 2022 vintage

Hooooooo boyyyyy. Parabola. Finally. We don’t see much FW here in Mass, but thankfully a trip to Philly found me at Half Time on the way back, where I ended up with this gem, as well as Perennial Abraxas! I’m so hyped to try this so let’s just get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This beer relies heavily on the bourbon barrels in the nose, with most of the complexity coming from them. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy whiskey, toasted oak, sweet vanilla, dark cherry, toffee, smoky tobacco, plum, milk chocolate, and toasted coconut

It is a bit less complex in taste, but I still think it’s just as good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, dark chocolate, toasted oak, brown sugar, and sweet bourbon. The swallow brings notes of spicy whiskey, plum, toasted oak, coconut, roasty coffee, tobacco, and toffee

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and oily beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent heat

This wasn’t mind blowing by any means, but it is pretty great. I grabbed a bottle from Half Time as well to cellar. Let’s see how this is holding up in 2 years",4.41

Rating the 2015 bottle I just had.

L: Almost black and pretty opague. Not too foamy.
S: Chocolate, cherries, and coffee or maybe espresso
T: My best way to describe this is that it tastes like someone poured bourbon or whiskey into a glass of red wine and mixed it with a chocolate bar-- but somehow some cherries fell in. Very strong,
F: Smooth and thick like I like my women.
O: This is so boozy and sweet without actually being too sweet like wine could be. Not sure how else to describe it. I took big sips but didn't rush it. I was so happy",4.65

L: Very dark brown (won't call it black), tiny head that recedes quickly and with little lacing.
S: Raisins, roasty, some barrel.
T: All sorts of things happening. When colder it matches the nose; as it warms you get rich dark chocolate, a little vanilla, and some booziness as well.
F: Thick, smooth, dessert-like.
O: Definitely should have opened this a couple years earlier but it's still one of the greats.",4.47
Parabola,"L: Looks almost black, small, quickly receding kh!ki head, no lacing.

F: Smooth, creamy, not much carbonation at all.
O: This is damn tasty and it certainly takes the chill oughta' these old bones.",4.42
Parabola,"It is difficult for me to get as hyperbolic as the average ratings for Parabola. But that's OK; I'm an old man and a high ABV (13.6 on the 2020 vintage) no longer impresses me. But, this is a wonderfully smooth RIS and it was enjoyed after-dinner along with two friends. Another year cellared will take care of two rough edges: lingering hops; and a fuller melding of the dark fruit and chocolate, like the dessert that Parabola should supplant.

I am an enthusiast for FW and particularly how its owner (Duvel) is smart enough to let FW do its thing. But that is another story littered throughout enough of my reviews of the 7 other brewers Duvel owns; all I like to varying degrees.",4.37

Parabola,"12 ounce bottle, 2021 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit/cherry, toffee, chocolate and earthiness. I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some oak, caramel, wheat, licorice, burnt/charred malt and rye. There's a lot going on here! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick, creamy and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. I thought this was a really good overall brew.

Parabola,"Poured from 12oz bottle into a tulip. This is the 2021 version, aged in bourbon, rye, and wheated whiskey barrels. It's hard to imagine I've gotten this far in my beer-drinking life and have never yet tasted any Parabola.

Appearance: entirely black with a finger and a half of thick, creamy dark-tan foam atop. Beers like this really have a head-start on looking good, don't they?

Smell: wood, malt, whiskey; maybe a little chocolate thrown in for good measure. There're notes of dark fruit as well, which you know I always love.

Taste: rich, that's for damn sure. There's dark cherry and raisin and date and prune, of course, but also just a bit of oak and whiskey that add an extra dimension to the fruit and sweetness and booze. Very, very good indeed. Really, very wonderful.

Mouthfeel: thick body with a good carbonation and plenty of smooth, rich creaminess.

Overall: you never know what you're walking into when it comes to a beer that has a big reputation, whether it's an oldie or something super hyped. This beer is just downright excellent.",4.59

Smell - Dark fruit. Plums. Very vinous, rounded out with some chocolate and roasted coffee character. 4.75

The taste is sweet with chocolate, cherry, wood and liquor.

It has a medium mouthfeel with a small amount of bubbly carbonation.  The finish starts complex with the licorice, chocolate and cherry, then fades to a long dry bittersweetness.

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Best by 9/28/24, bottled 9/28/21

Here we are, review #1300!! For this milestone review, I obtained the absolutely legendary Westy 12, the highest rated Quad on BA and #46 overall. A long time want of mine (over 3 years), so I finally decided to pull the trigger and get some shipped from Belgium. This is not as fresh as I hoped to try it, but I’m sure it hasn’t faded all that much. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy medium brown/red with 2 fingers of creamy light tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s super fruity in the nose, with a huge booze and yeast complexity to it. I’m picking up on aromas of red grape, dates, brown sugar, port wine, nutty malt, earthy toffee, molasses, clove, and light red apple

Oh man, in taste it is much more malt driven, but it’s still plenty fruity and complex. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pumpernickel, red grape, sweet caramel, peppercorn, baked apple, brown sugar, clove, toasted nuts, and light port wine. The swallow brings notes of sweet booze, raisin, molasses, brown sugar, pumpernickel, port wine, clove, baked apple, leather, and light tobacco

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes slightly with a huge complexity that dries over time

Wow. I just had to give this one a bump in the overall. So unique and ever changing, it’s addicting. I’m so happy I picked up a 6 pack of this whale, and happy to finally have it in the books",4.56
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Found randomly in the fridge at Beer360 in Richmond, Australia in November 2021. The proprietor told me there were a number hidden away in the fridge to see if anyone found them and realised what they were. I sure as hell did! This review is based on some hastily scribbled notes, so might be somewhat sparse in comparison to the complexity presented by this wonderful beer. The beer was drunk in April 2022.

In the glass, the beer presents a burnt, muddy brown, pushing towards over-ripe, bruised plum in colour. There's a thin, off-white head.

The aroma is dark cherries, brown sugar, plum, red fruits, dark cherry and Christmas cake.

The taste is complex and ever-changing. There are dark fruits, red fruits, brown sugar and booze at first, and as the beer warms it moves to liqueur, cough syrup, sweet licorice and dark Christmas cake, with the booze backing off. There is almost certainly more peeking through, but everything intermingles so well together it's hard to identify specific notes in the overall melange.

The mouthfeel is full and smooth.

Overall, there's a reason this is so sought after. It's my second-highest-rated beer on Untappd (behind KBS) and, without looking, I suspect it will be my highest on BA. It's also the most expensive beer I've ever bought, coming in at around $55AUD for a 330ml bottle, which is about $48 more than an average beer! Nevertheless, it's grabbed without hesitation every time I see it.

Cheers!",4.7
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Amazing Quadrupel. If you cannot get your hands on it, just go with the St. Bernardus ABT.

It gets even better with a few years age on it if stored properly with existing molasses and chocolate undertones coming out in full force. There is a reason why this is a top rated bier for decades and not just because it is difficult to obtain.",4.94
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Re-reviewing 4/7/2022, the second time I’ve enjoyed this beer.

330mL (best by 10/13/2019, so bottled 10/13/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a clean deep reddish-brown mahogany with minimal white head, slow steady carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass. Evenly distributed particulates of yeasty sediment in suspension throughout the liquid are illuminated by overhead light.

Aroma is bready and sweet, dryly fruity. Dates and figs, cinnamon and other spices, brown sugar/caramel, light tobacco—so many smells intermingle like wafting smoke, constantly changing. Not strong or powerful, just wonderfully complex and deep.

Taste is likewise sweet and sugary, with so many layers of flavor to pick apart. Brown sugar; rum-soaked dates, figs, and prunes; candi sugar; warm yeasty bread; smoky leather/pipe tobacco. Just a touch of warming alcohol as it goes down—given the high ABV it’s well hidden.

Mouthfeel is wonderfully deep and full, with gently prickly carbonation that allows the beer to dance on the palate without ever getting heavy or syrupy. Finishes semi-dry and clean. Just right.

Overall just an outstanding beer, obviously one of the best within its style if not overall one of the best beers in production. World class.
___________________________________________

Below is my previous review from 10/6/2011, for posterity:

Rating 4.52/5 (look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 | overall: 4.5)

330mL bottle (best by 8/29/2010 on the cap) poured into a St. Bernardus chalice. Mahogany brown color with a thin fizzy head that dissipates quickly - nice carbonation continues to rise to the surface.

Aroma is dark fruits, figs, dates, brown sugar, spice, rum, and a hint of molasses. Smells exquisite.

Taste is rich and complex. Sweet dark caramel malt, spice, booze, figs, and raisins. Super smooth, chewy mouthfeel. Fills every taste bud with a complex blend of flavors.

This beer totally lives up to the hype. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the head - but this beer is also 4+ years old, which may account for that. If I try another one I'll make sure to get it fresh.

(Note: This tasting was done side-by-side with Rochefort 10 and I found this beer just ever so slightly more impressive on the aroma and mouthfeel. Otherwise they were very close.)",4.68
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"been holding on to this one for a while now, been finding the right excuse to have it, and i was ireland lose to belgium in the football, i decided now was as good a time as ever to have this most legendary of beers, a beer like this can never live up to its reputation, but to be fair it is damn nice, it has a complexity to it that the other two great belgian quads (sb12 and tr10) dont have so much, black bread, dark chocolate, and raisins and plum combined with almost saison-esque leathery flavours, oaky, earthy, little bit of vanilla, spice, liquorice, medium bitterness on the finish, delicate body with high levels of carbonation, little bit of warming from the alcohol, dryness on the finish, fruity flavours and spice linger, maybe not the best beer in the world, but it really is quite good, an essential for any beer enthusiast, glad i finally got to try it",4.44
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Bought by appointment at the monastery, a crate each of 12, 8 and blonde. The 12 is a monster. Tried many tripels/quads from St. Bernardus, Chimay, La Trappe and others (mostly on tap) the same week, but the depth and complexity of this one is a step above. Pours dark, light head without much density, not a huge nose. Creamy mouthfeel. Not malt-forward, heavy but balanced, with background flavors of raisin, leather, brown sugar, ginger and clove, and a surprisingly short finish and just a bit of bite. Small sips provide revelation after revelation. If you can ignore the hype and the crazy prices on the secondary market, this is 100% worthy of all the praise.",4.93
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a ruby red hue when held up against the light and a medium, fluffy head. Smells of bready, caramel malt, dark fruit and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana clove and allspice, as well as just a hint of brown sugar. Taste is an excellent balance of bready, caramel malt and dark, estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of chocolate, brown sugar and licorice. Finishes with a medium sweetness and some estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and low/medium carbonation.

While I didn't want to admit it, simply due to the ridiculous secondary price, this certainly is one of the finest Quads that I've ever had. I still don't think that it's worth 5 times the price of Rochefort or Bernadus Quadruple, but from memory it does stand just slightly above these simply due to balance and body/mouthfeel. The balance of sweet and spicy notes really is excellent here, with a very rich estery character, body and mouthfeel. Overall, this makes for a very rich and well-balanced Quad that may not be worth its secondary price, but still stands on it's own incredibly well, with the ABV hardly being noticeable at all. I think that it's the richness, smoothness and balance which makes this stand just slightly above similar offerings, but from a value-for-money standpoint I'd still rather have a Rochefort 10.",4.62
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Poured from a 11.2 ounce bottle with no label and a gold cap into a chalice glass. I purchased six bottles dated ""12.10.24"" which I understand to mean they were bottled on October 12, 2021 and the ""best by"" date is three years after bottling or October 12, 2024. I also received a bottle dated ""19.01.14"" which means it was bottled on January 19, 2011 and the ""best by"" date is January 19, 2014. I purchased these bottles online on December 10, 2021 at westvleterenshop.com for $228.70 USD (Beer $149.00, Shipping $72.99, tax $6.71). The scores will be for the new bottle but I will include a review after for the old bottle just for fun complete with scores.

APPEARANCE: pours a dark, brown color with two fingers tan head that slowly dissipated until only a ring of small bubbles remained around the rim of glass, I swirled the bottle before final pour so there are larger bits of sediment that fell to bottom of glass, surprisingly the beer is not highly carbonated, it's not flat but maybe less than average carbonation, there is light lacing on the glass.

SMELL: dark fruits like fig and raisin, there is some black licorice and chocolate, bread, the 10.2% alcohol is clearly present.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially bread, figs and raisins, black licorice and chocolate, the alcohol is also present, less sweet than some other beers in this style.

PALATE: lower carbonation gave this a more creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: to me this is not the ""best beer in the world"", it's not even the best Quad, it's a good beer don't misunderstand, I enjoyed this beer immensely and would be pleased to have it again if I'm ever in Belgium but I will never pay $228.70 USD to drink this again, I can think of two Quads I like better, Rochefort 10 and St Bernardus and they are way more affordable, my opinion is that the scarcity and high cost of this beer has created an undeserved amount of hype and influenced people to score it higher that it deserves, I do not regret buying this beer, I can always make more money, I would recommend to anyone in Belgium but would not recommend anyone pay $228.70 to obtain this good not great beer.

Look 3.5 Smell 3.75 Taste 4 Feel 3.50 Overall 4

APPEARANCE: pours a dark brown color with very little head that dissipated quickly until there was no head remaining, I swirled the bottle on the last pour, there was very little sediment in the bottom, lower carbonation but it's still present after almost 11 years, no lacing on the glass.

SMELL: initially sweet brown sugar and an earthy note of figs and raisins, I can't perceive the alcohol at all, not as complex on the nose as a more recent bottle.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet brown sugar, the earthy note is dominant but there are figs and raisins, less complex than a more recent bottle.

PALATE: very low carbonation and creamy mouthfeel.

OVERALL: I would not recommend aging any beer as long as 11 years, the biggest issue is carbonation will begin to fail, the complexity is degraded, the alcohol was less noticeable but the pleasant aspects of the taste are diminished as well, I would not recommend aging, I know you can but, it's not as good, I would drink this beer as soon as possible.",4.24
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Received as part of NBW BIF #13 and just now getting to it. BB date was 12/22 so I am guessing it was about 4 years old.
Poured the color of cold brew coffee and sports a manilla color head which leaves copious lacing.
The aroma was stone fruit and malts, I tried to find spices but failed. Still, excellent aroma.
The taste, wow; while it pretty much followed the aroma, the layers and power of flavors is impressive. Stone fruit mingling with biscuit like malts and they made an excellent pair.

OA, excellent beer and so glad I got to try it!",4.84
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I don’t know how old the bottle is, but purchased relatively recently and shipped from Belgium to me in Chicago. First off I think this is the coolest bottle I’ve ever had. Who else could get away with no label?! I don’t get a ton off of the nose, but I can tell it’s a quad and I’m liking it. It’s a gorgeous looking beer when poured too. It has an impressive full mouthfeel with the perfect carbonation. There’s a bit of a tart dry finish that I really like as well. Overall this is worth the hype and I hope the style doesn’t lose its popularity anytime soon.",4.73
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),Even looking at the no label bottle with the engraved circle is somewhat imposing. This one had rested for about 5 years. It poured a dark plum to prune color with still a good level of carbonation. The aroma was wonderful stone fruit. The complex character was true to form as still to me the best beer in the world. It made the perfect Thanksgiving beer and made me appreciate the good things in the world. Cheers.,5.0
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Thanks to Coronaeus for this, probably my biggest 'Want' ever. This 330ml bottle, part of a limited, labeled, North American release a few years ago, had a best before date that I couldn't read. Poured into 12oz tulip. Poured the expected and anticipated very deep chestnut of the style, with about a half-inch tan head that dissipated at a moderate pace and left no lacing.

The aroma had all the big stone fruit scents one expects, solid, earthy grains, and a touch of yeast spice and esters. Maybe, just maybe, a touch of alcohol heat as well.

On the tongue, all those aspects were apparent, just amplified. The fruitiness was bolder, the malts stronger, the yeast had more bite, and there was certainly a bit of alcohol heat at the back end.

The body, while full, was a bit lighter than I was expecting, making the beer float over the palate rather than flooding it. The finish wasn't nearly as sweet as I would have thought, and dried out quickly.

Drinkability was awesome, you could easily drink a couple of these without getting bored.

Overall, a truly great beer, worthy of all its multitude of praises. A must try for any beer lover.",4.63
Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"I'm not gonna get all fucking scientific or anything... I won't be describing 20 different fruits, tastes or 20 different feelings... it's just a good beer!

Trappist Westvleteren 12 (XII),"Thought I’d never score one…much less three…thanks Michele!

Poured cold to a champagne coup…closest to a chalice I have. Nose is light floral, with a strong funky bready yeast. Thin effervescent head that maintains throughout. Color is a dark amber, with a few floaters. Taste is a solid crackery malt, with a constant hit of funkiness. Mouthfeel is crisp, with an earthy heaviness, and a ton of carbonation. As it warms, there is a stone fruit vibe that really overtakes the tongue. Alcohol doesn’t bite, but brings on some warming fairly quickly. I’d say it’s a great representation of the style, but hell, isn’t this that misleading? This is OG for the style, from which others should compare. I should let the next half of the title warm, as that seems to really bring out more complexity. The flavor lingering is really satisfying.

Double Citra®,"Canned on 10/6/21; consumed on 10/28/21

Pours an almost turbid golden burnt orange body capped with two fingers of lush, fluffy, white foam; good head retention yields a thin layer of cap, a hearty, expansive collar, and generous spread of webby/spotty lacing coating the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to deeply floral citrus refined to fresh orange juice accents and a fluffy lime underlay; papaya rind and soft melon ease over the middle as tinges of black peppercorn phased effortlessly into flaky, plush malt profile on the back end of the bouquet.

Taste shows mango upfront grazed with pineapple tart transitioning to lemon meringue against a fluffy malt base over the mid-palate; melon touches the back end, a briefly sweet interlude as musty grass and delicate, underripe passionfruit and grapefruit finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation, dispersing a hoppy twang fusing to juiciness over the mid-palate; the back end highlights a zesty character invigorating a taut, drying finish.

Waves of stimulation texture effortlessly attenuated character, seeing a pillowy malt profile support zesty citrus and pangs of sweeter tropical nectar in playful contrast; common with Hill's DIPAs, stimulating yet universally approachable displays.",4.4

Double Citra®,"L: Gorgeous cream hazy wheat. About 1/2 inch of frothy head with lacing that hangs on the side of the glass.

S: Aroma comes bounding out of the can. The Citra is overwhelming, in a good way. Stone fruit, papaya, ripe melon. Wow.

T: Citra at the front, leading to pine/resin, with sweet fruit here and there. Not an overwhelming alcohol-flavor either, despite the 8%

F: This is quite effervescent, with a peppery and dry finish. Just an absolutely perfect amount of carbonation - enough of a bite to notice, but also simultaneously juicy and mouth-watering.

O: This is a spectacular beer. What puts this double with Citra above many others is that it hits every piece perfectly - aroma, taste, mouthfeel. Many juicy IPAs pack in the aroma or flavor, but really miss with the high alcohol content and mouth feel and either come off as too strong, or flat.

Doubleganger,"Fresh cans from Sandwich, enjoyed on Cape Cod and back home in Nashville.

Glowing orange-gold body of haze and near-murk — pure juice. Medium head of compact, off-white bubbles. Fantastic lacing.

Heavy sweet tropical fruits on the nose, balanced with lovely floral and herbal notes, breadiness, and a slight bite of pine. But if the familiar Juicy Fruit characteristics of a big TH hazy, but also a yeasty element. Each whiff is a little different than the last.

Taste could follow but is a little overwhelmed by a starchy green element, which takes it down a notch or two. Still heavy tropical fruit, very juicy, with a nice semi-sweetness. The grassiness overshadows any breadiness or pine characteristics that might be present. The can describes a sharp but pleasant finish, which I was hoping meant a nice bitterness. But this is more of a sharp green, chalky note that steels from the experience.

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a more intense version of their ""doppelganger"". An inch and a quarter of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far, falling in a little bit and become rocky looking. The aroma is pretty bright with notes of orange, berries, other tropical fruit, apple, hops resins, and pine. The taste keeps it going with additional notes of mango, honeydew melon, pssionfruit, and grapefruit. The malt is sweetish and bready, supporting the hop notes. A moderate bitterness and a fair amount of acidic ""hop bite"" balance it and it finishes dry with some fruit, resin, earth, and pine lingering. The head has held up really well and the lacing is fantastic. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gently crisp carbonation and a little zest from all of the hop acids, and then smooth towards the finish because of all the extra proteins. This one is really nicely balanced.

Doubleganger,"6 weeks old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a hazy dark orange with a fluffy and stable white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. No floaters.

Smell: A combination of ripe orange and tropical mango and pineapple. Hoppy, dank and sweet. A bit sharp.

Taste: Citrusy notes of orange, tangerine and grapefruit with subtle tropical hints. Not as sweet es the smell suggests. Zesty, bitter and slightly sharp.

Feel: Very juicy. Medium carbonation. Smooth and silky.

Overall: Even though smell and look were almost perfect right from the beginning, it took a bit for the taste to fully develop. A bit too green and bitter when cold, it developed into a smooth and nicely balanced juice with just the right amount of everything. One of the best Tree House beers I've had so far.",4.68

Taste is aggressive but balanced wonderfulness (if you like dank & hazy) so smooth that sadness permeates your empty glass. Just a bitterness reminder on your tongue that lasts. It tastes like sad regret.

Feel is unicorn & rainbows

Doubleganger,"Average pour fills two-thirds of a pint glass with deep tan foam, takes some time to settle down enough to take a sip, curiously not much stick to the lacing. The liquid basically looks like you took a glass of apricot juice and stuck in the freezer, impenetrable and immobile. The nose packs a solid punch of dank herbaceousness, roofing tar, pine sap and thick, sticky pineapple, mango, kiwi with some melon and peach in reserve, not teasing out any citrus nor florality. Full-bodied, without the help of the weakish carbonation manages nonetheless to develop nice momentum across the palate. In turn while it's juicy and ""damp"" at first there is a pleasing elevation in dryness at the end. Notes of brioche and challah bread pile on the mango, papaya, pineapple, kiwi fruit, intense fruit flavors. Vanilla ice cream touch pops up now and then. Still barely registering any citrus, pink grapefruit if anything. On the whole it tastes awfully like a confection dessert. Scores points for sheer bombast but I'd be hard pressed to see anyone easily put back two cans of it in a row, it's that tiring. (Canned 7/30/21)",4.33

Maman,"'20 batch.

Maman 2020 is a blend of 2 distinct threads. The first consisting of base stout aged 22 months in Heaven Hill barrels, this comprises 80% of the blend. The remaining 20% is base stout aged 27 months on Weller barrels. We tasted through a couple dozen barrels to find a blend that best exemplifies our beloved barrel aged stout, Maman. Oak, maple, marshmallow, and caramel all dominate the aroma, with waves of rich brownie batter fudge and Heath bars wrap up the palate. We always strive for a balance of flavors in our beers, and we feel the nuance and surprising drinkability make this vintage of Maman something we’re immensely proud of.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like high quality chocolate truffles, cookie dough, brownies, vanilla, spicy oak, caramelly bourbon, English toffee, marshmallow, heavy roast, and light smoke.

This has been high on my list of ""must-tries"" for a long time, and it really did meet my expectations. It's a pure expression of the power of barrel - you could tell me this has chocolate or vanilla or caramel added to it, and I'd believe you. There's very little booze here, and there's great oaky complexity on the back end helping keep things balanced. There's some definite roast and bitterness - it's not just pure pastry here.

This is medium bodied, not the thickest stout ever, but that honestly helps here - keeping it light on its feet and very drinkable. There's barely any booze to this.

It's hard to find much to fault this one for. It's truly excellent - barrel aged chocolate marshmallow chunk brownies, essentially.",4.86

Ann,"Bottle generously shared by Seth. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. The nose is somewhat bland with barrel highlights. Real smooth with good carbonation.

Ann,"My long time white whale, we meet at last...

As we slowly worked through a collection of Hill bottles this evening, we started with shelf bottles and transitioned into sacrificing a few wine barrel aged versions. The progression is beautifully subtle, while the difference in appearance between them is pretty stark. Ann has much less visible carbonation than Anna, with only a short bubbly collar on top of a shimmering clear burnt amber body. This has closer to a honey appearance, whereas Anna is a hazier, paler yellow, with a larger, fluffier white head.

The aging process has cleaned her up quite a bit more than I was expecting, delivering a delicate experience that is less funky, yet more woody. White grape, riesling wine, and even notes of buttery chardonney develop as it finishes just barely dry, falling off the palate quickly. There's a hint of green olive, and it's only mildly sour, with essentially no funkiness at all. This is possibly the most wine-like experience I've gotten out of a beer. So much so we were contemplating opening a bottle of white wine to compare. It even sweetens up over time.

Ann is absurdly refined and complex, yet exceedingly simple. It does not have the body of the other wonderful Farmstead beers, and while I love it, I think in the long run that slaying a whale such as this puts into perspective just how fantastic the base beer is, as well as all the other HF shelfies, which are just so supple, easy to enjoy, and complex in their own right.

Bottled 2015, released 2019. Thanks Stanley!",4.52
Ann,"Awesome to finally try this; great wine, light funk, touch of honey up front; Anna’s funk and honey comes through nicely, with nice sweetness, grains of paradise, mild mild tartness in back; the honey pops as it warms, super flavorful, floral finish. Wow.",4.65
Ann,"Glad to cross this one off the bucket list. Shared at HF. Golden pour, baby finger sized white head, no lacing. Aroma of green grape, white wine, oak, apricot, white peach.

Fuzzy,"A: Tangerine pour with fiery hues to apricot. The neck films a shade of macaroon cream that’s dismissive per inscription, from the preset retention. Howbeit, an irksomeness to turns offers lace docility, as the intervals thermally protract. There’s a touch of transparency upon the settlements of course, while effervescence becomes a mobilized variance

S: Pierced rusticity for white peach with esterification authorities. Illustrated by, a bitingly tart eruption that’s tamed enough for the developing – wild yeast – appearances. The progression opts for some grainy malt to the motivated horsed phenols, which quietly idle funk steps. Principally, satchels and farmstalls with soiled mold. Nonetheless, acidity is tenacious on fruit bouquets, as the lactic stability is detrimental to frowzy quirks. There’s elements of solvency thru the open air drafts, which incriminate nail polish and naphtha agents. On the other hand, that piece is often stupefied, given the peppery phenol attunement to floral hops, and biscuit-y malt brackets to stone fruit minerals

T: A clean, consecutive, punch-down stomp that puts natural peaches in vanguard. Notations subtly follow in ripening depictions of Goldrich apricots and Armking nectarines, while briny minerals perimeter Neptune grass. In correlation, an engine for Eugenol to promptly pump in cloves and nutmeg, while maintaining that peppery attenuation. The ongoing drive is earthy and persistently bright, with calming acidity on the advances of rural funk. To that end, the move adds haystacks atop the citrus connotations, but keeps that musty jazz in a distant place. Aerial attacks begin setting in, from oak dragged elasticities, and prompt in some leathery satchels. Whilst, Chardonnay attenuates a staleness for Budapestlängd with an oxidative nuttiness

M: Does not puncture with puckered acridity, but rather maintains a level of energy that rationally aids. Namely, a backend for rustic brettanomyces, and a pillar for biscuit-y grains. The approach is brisk in carbonation, as the approach is crisp in sensation. Thus, cleanly bright with minor overextensions in the presetting bites, but pleasingly uplifting in the dry – erosional – reliefs

O: Showcases clean peach natures with a caustic effervescence that’s costly to the preliminary entwines, of wild yeast. Though, development is rapid enough to calm the impaling authorities, and make rational moves. In this situation, light malts provide an aid to earthy hop kicks, while acclimating spiced esters with musty phenols. The approach is thereby tart with brett funk complexions, and spurs wooded fruit tannins on an astutely dry/crisp exhibition",4.15

S: Aroma is a great balance of fruit sweetness and tart sour characters. Huge fruit flesh characters with big peach as expected but also tangerine and apricot. Lactic acidity and sour citrus to balance, I would say the tart/sour characters are moderate on the nose. A bit of melting plastic like funk and mineral notes round it out.

T: Taste is very delicious. Much more sour than the nose, with huge puckering tartness. Wonderful sweet fruit notes to balance, it’s very orange-family fruit forward with notes of oranges, tangerines, nectarines. Peace is primarily on the finish, but is quite nice. Pretty big lemon tartness as well. Really fantastic.

M/D: Mouthfeel is fuller bodied, carbonation is appropriately high even though it looks flat in the glass, drinkability is very good.

O: Overall, this is an excellent beer, no doubt. Although #37 overall rating on BA seems damn high. Fair or not, I always compare these American Wild Ales to traditional Lambics, and even very well done ones such as this tend to lack the depth and complexities of most offerings from the likes of 3F and Cantillon. Regardless, still a treat, and would happily drink any day of the week.

Happy New Year BA’s!

Fuzzy,"Beautiful looking beer, pungent aromas of fuzzy peach skin, under-ripe white peach flesh, lemony acidity, and a hint of peach rings and oak. the nose on this is really wonderful.

wish I could say the same about the taste - I feel like this could be used as an effective cleaning product. there is definitely a robust and complex peach flavor that is very impressive, but the overwhelming dryness and acidity detracts from that and probably drowns out some of the more subtle complexity. getting some grainy character and hints of vinegar, white grape and vanilla. don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed this beer, but it was sour and acidic to the point of almost being harsh ... I tend to prefer more subtle and delicate examples of the style. As I finished the bottle I thought well this was good but I would have been fine with 8oz, which is something I have never said after drinking a 375mL of world class fruited mixed ferm.",4.32
Fuzzy,"Review #500: Side Project - Fuzzy

Batch 4 (2020) 375ml - poured into a tulip at 42°F.

Pours a moderately foggy sunglow orange, not dissimilar to the peach on the label. A thin, coarse, broken off-white head almost forms, before quickly falling, leaving only a razor-thin collar, and constant streams of effervescence. 4.25

Nose: Signature Side Project pale base, with evident crackery grains, a touch of malt, and some dusty silo. The peaches are restrained - apparent, but not loud, lending a very organic white peach aroma, much like nectarine. The acidity translates as fresh lemon juice, and just a splash of apple cider vinegar - tame, and bright. There is a ton of wet white oak - woody and musty, playing with some funky wet hay, raw honey, stone cellar, dusty attic, leather, parchment, honeysuckle, lilac, dried leaves, and peach blossoms. Not aggressive funky or tart.

Palate: Fuzzy greets the palate with a quick flash of tartness - lactic and acetic in nature, lending some lemon juice and apple cider vinegar. The peaches, once more, are very natural and ripe, but not jammy. These are fruity, bright white peaches, with most of their fructose fermented out. Huge stone fruit notes of peach, nectarine, apricot, and a big plum presence. Remarkably floral, with honeysuckle, lilac, gardenia, and even a hint of honeydew melon. As the acidity curves, oak begins to show, along with a hint of sweet grain, which adds nice balance. Some farmhouse notes of hay, wet wet, stone, and earth emerge, providing that true wild touch, with the brett adding a nice dusty, sweaty, overripe element. It finishes remarkably clean, with a general stone fruit presence behind a fading acidity, some subtle grain, and drying wet white oak, with nothing really lingering.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's incredible how Side Project can produce these 8% ABV wild ales with such clean, crisp, snappy fluidity. Fuzzy is light-bodied, with no real malt weight, and quite dry, with no significant residual sugars. Perhaps a touch less sparkling than champagne, but with a similar feel - airy, clean, bright, and snappy. Acidity is tart - sour, even, but definitely shy of puckering. The finish has some nice drying tannic oak. Ultra-clean.

Overall: Fuzzy is a bottle with a lofty reputation. Long considered one of the finest fruited wild ales. That's a tall order. Is it the greatest wild ale I've ever had? I wouldn't say so. Is it the greatest peach sour I've ever had? Most likely. What it most certainly is, is the definition of Side Project. Yes, it is one of the more sour offerings, using their high acid blonde base, but it isn't overbearing, and it's one of the more subtle offerings - beautifully showcases the delicate nuance and balance that they're so great at. The tartness, the minerality, the organic nature of the fruit, the oak, the gentle funk, all meticulously blended. It really is a world-class wild ale, and one everyone should try at some point.",4.39

Labeled as blend #4.
L: hazy tangerine juice. Slight carbonation in the glass, which funny because it wouldn’t stop overflowing out the cap for 10 minutes.
S: Peaches, tart, funk.
T: peachy goodness. A little funk. A little sweet. A lot of sour. Almost like sour candy. Some notes of lime, vanilla, oak, barn.

Nectarine Premiere,"Bottled September 2020

Alright folks, here we are, the final BIF beer I received from @Eziel! It’s been a wild 6 months of hard to find beers, and we’re ending with the heaviest hitter of the bunch. This is currently the 5th highest rated Saison on BA and 52nd overall. Those are some impressive stats. Also, I’m not sure if I’ve ever seen a beer fruited with only nectarine, it’s usually a blend. Let’s get into it

Pours an opaque orange gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that very quickly fizzes away to nothing and leaves no lacing

Sheesh, less than stellar appearance aside, this is bold in the nose, just super fruity and tart with a big funk too. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet nectarine, wet hay, tart apricot, sharp oak, lemon yogurt, wildflower honey, straw, and crackery malt

Oh man, the funk is even punchier in taste, but not in a way that's out of balance. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart peach, lemon juice, white wine vinegar, stone, sharp oak, nectarine, wet hay, honey, and lemongrass. The swallow brings notes of wet hay, stone, white wine vinegar, peach pit, nectarine, sharp oak, crackery malt, lemon yogurt, and light orange juice

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp and zippy beer. Finishes bone dry with a lovely balance of sour fruit and funk

Wow, this is one hell of a beer! It's highly complex, yet I could chug it. But why would I do that? I plan on nursing this bottle over the course of the night",4.51
Nectarine Premiere,"poured from a 750mL bottle into a stemmed taster glass. pours a foggy orange with minimal white head. huge fleshy, juicy nectarines on the nose and taste. a lot of funk with some oak impact as well. excellent mouthfeel. not overly thick but perfectly carbonated. one of the best dGs i’ve had the pleasure of drinking.",4.63
Nectarine Premiere,"this one has been on my most wanted list for awhile, so huge thanks to my boy for scoring this for us to share, what a gem! its as good as i hoped it would be, the nectarine popping in here, natural and juicy, the essence of the fruit as so many de garde beers deliver, and it seems right in its peak, bottle from september 2020. pale brew with some haze through most of the bottle, very fizzy but not holding a ton of head, and a nose that my mouth is still watering from, wow its puckery, nectarous, and juicy, ripe and sweet and sour at the same time, wood heavy, fully wild, incredible aroma here and it gets better as it warms, more fruit, more funk, more wood. the flavor is fantastic, the fruit hits mostly at the end, its mature vinous funky wild beer up front, slightly raw on the grain side maybe some unmalted wheat in here, pils malt, doughy and crackery and simple but earthy. the ferment is sharp but not overly sour, tannic from the oak, maybe some white wine character too, lots of well developed bretty funk too. when the fruit hits its like taking a bite of a ripe nectarine, and it stays on the tongue through the finish. impressively real, forward, and its crazy this is as dry as it is because the fruit is so sweet, amazing. this has already developed well in the bottle, but i think its safe to say even more time would evolve it further. its maybe not as complex on the yeast side as my favorite de garde beers, but the fruit element is as good as it gets. great carbonation here too, lively and excited feeling on the palate, fits the summery fruitiness. loved this, very thankful! i know this is one of their highest rated beers, but its probably not even in my top five from them, amazing as it is...",4.45
Nectarine Premiere,"13 July 2021 - Beer #244 - BA Top 250 Alert!

Acquired via trade

Appearance: 4 - a lovely bright orange. Head fizzled away immediately.

Nose: 5 - tons of nectarine. I like those better than peaches.

Taste: 4 - mmm, interesting. It's a very impressive sour, but it's missing the blast of fruit I was expecting. Tastes a bit hoppy, if you can believe it.

Mouth: 5 - zillions of tiny bubbles. Expertly crafted.

Overall: 4 - reminds me of some of the best non-fruited sours I've had, but that's not what this is supposed to be.

Cheers!",4.34
Nectarine Premiere,"To-go can, getting to finally try a Degarde for the 2nd time. The color looks stone fruit peach oranges. The smell is very distinct of sourness, vinegary, slight fruit notes. Overall I was hoping for that special first sip that takes my breath away but a bit disappointment bit nevertheless, it's good. Cheers",4.2
KBS,"Attractive thick tan head, fairly opaque. Delicious combination of coffee/chocolate/bourbon. A little sweeter and more overtly chocolate than my ideal, but still extremely good.",4.75
KBS,"This is a highly-rated beer which prompted me to try it. It's wonderfully complex - chocolate and bourbon on the nose, full-bodied and rich with a velvety mouth feel, finishing off with more bourbon, a little bitterness, and a hint of sweetness.",4.38
KBS,"Black, beige foam, ok.
Toasted smell, chocolate, coffee, artichoke. Intense. Good.
Salty caramel, vanilla. Barrel notes, smooth and chocolately. Almost oily.
Bitter aftertaste, again caramel and vanilla. Oak.
A classic, very good.",4.36
KBS,"A most impressive imperial stout. Beautiful chocolate color with a light head rising to the top. Respectfully strong but smooth, light hints of bourbon and chocolate taste. Not over powering and does not disappoint. This beer clearly demands a high rating! My favorite stout to date.",5.0
KBS,"So happy to see this on a SW Florida Publix supermarket shelf today. I am a bourbon lover and I can't imagine a better partner for a fine, high proof bourbon than this beer. Enjoying my first bottle with a healthy pour of Lil'Book Chapter 3. Dinner can wait.",4.9
KBS,"Poured from a brown 12 oz. bottle. Has a black color with a 1/2 inch head. Smell is of chocolate, bourbon. Taste is strong of bourbon, some chocolate, a bit on the boozy side. Feels medium bodied in the mouth and overall is a solid beer, but I was expecting more based on the ratings here.",3.83
KBS,"Poured from bottle into snifter after about a day in the 50 degree wine cooler.
Look: deep brown, nearly black, with a light coffee colored head. Delightful
Smell: IMO this is the best part of the KBS. Comes off almost like a Mexican hot chocolate with deep chocolate notes, some small cinnamon hints. Booziness apparent from the scent.
Taste: Matches the smell nearly to a T. Heavy alcohol heat throughout with the chocolate notes brightening as it leaves your mouth. Just like a barrel stout should be. Quite sweet, but even as someone who doesn’t love sweet beers, it’s great.
Feel: Carbonation is quite low, so the combination of the stout density and boozy heat creates a rather unique, slick feel in the mouth. High sugar content seems to be enhanced by the slick feel.
Overall: King of barrel aged stouts for me. Great stuff",4.76
KBS,"Preface by saying I’m not the biggest stout fan.

Bottled 12/4/2021 poured straight from the fridge into a frosted glass. Started around 48° and it was very closed up. Still able to get all the main notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and bourbon, but they were nowhere near as strong until the beer warmed up. My favorite temp was about 55-60° but I sipped until it hit closer to 70°

Overall: Incredible stout. Loads of separate flavors that all come together perfectly!

L: pitch black color, can’t even see light coming through when held up to a lamp. Toasted brown head with good retention and lacing from top to bottom.

S: at first I got more chocolate than anything else, but as the beer warmed up 5-10° I got a much darker chocolate and strong coffee notes followed by bourbon on the end. Chocolate heavy overall

T:cold straight from the fridge at 48° I got some coffee and chocolate and maybe some black licorice with a heavy hit of alcohol at the end. As the beer warmed up the alcohol completely disappeared. Strong coffee flavor followed by dark chocolate and some nice bitterness that you would get from a nice piece of dark chocolate. Bourbon follows on the aftertaste. Slightly sweet at first with a bitter ending. Some roasted malt, but coffee and chocolate are by far the strongest notes.

F: low carbonation, thicker and slightly creamy without being overly heavy. Very smooth",4.44
KBS,"Look: Poured from a 12 oz into a glass - Midnight black pour just like a stout. lightly thin/ brown foam risen to the surface. Quickly dissolves over time. A bit of lacing on the sides like some of these bubbles don't want to give up.
Smell: Getting the heavy notes of sweet bourbon barrels - getting some chocolatey vanilla aromas to it. Not much on the coffee side this pour.
Taste: Definitely tasting the heavy chocolate, coffee and bourbon. The initial taste is coffee, followed by the taste of coffee, finishing with the bourbon after taste. Very nice!!!!
Feel: Getting light carbonation - very smooth. Very well hides the alcohol.
Overall: This bad boy proves to live up to it's standards. Wasn't sure because barrel aged stouts aren't my route but this proved me differently. Will buy again and if you haven't tried it. This is a must try beer!",5.0

L---Darkest brown color. Fairly thin light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left ok lacing. Head doesn't sound like much, but I think it's actually pretty good for the high ABV.

S---Strong chocolate, lighter vanilla and bourbon barrel. Not as much coffee as I was expecting.

T---Wow, very flavorful and nuanced. Chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla are all distinct. ABV is well hidden behind sweetness.

F---Medium/full bodied with minimal carbonation. Almost a creamy texture with no alcohol burn.

O---I have been looking forward to trying this one and I was not disappointed. The best offering from an excellent brewery.",4.51
KBS,"I recently tried and reviewed Founders - Breakfast Stout, which is also highly regarded. Similar to that review, I will state that I actively dislike coffee. Both the taste and the smell. So I don't foresee me falling in love with this beer, but I did want to try it out to see what all the fuss was about.

L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at roughly 55 degrees. The beer pours a dark black opaque. Very thin film of tan head which quickly faded to bubbles. The thin head only leaves moderate lacing.

S - The roasted coffee comes up front with a slight hint of chocolate. Not much else. It's pretty much straight-up coffee smell.

T - The coffee roast comes up front, then fades to a chocolate. There’s a little bit of cola flavor there too. The flavor is then balanced with a slight bourbon at the end. Aftertaste is a mild coffee roast. Toward the end of the beer though, the coffee notes fade a little and the chocolate notes take center stage. The taste is much more complex and pleasing than the smell.

F - The carbonation is almost like a cola. Smooth texture overall. Easy to drink.

O - Again, I tried this a week after trying Founders Oatmeal Stout. From memory, they are very similar. (Not sure about side-by-side comparison.) As I stated in that previous review, I do not like coffee. Taste or smell. But these were so highly regarded that I had to try them. I still don’t prefer the coffee taste, but this is still a great beer. Very smooth flavors that go together well. The 12% alcohol did not make this boozy at all. It was all flavor and no sign of high alcohol. I personally won’t try this again, but for a coffee drinker, this would be a fantastic beer.

Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",3.72
KBS,"Beautiful color and head. Notes of chocolate. Slight coffee flavor while sipping. Very slight bourbon taste, which is fine. Very delicious, but not as rich as I was hoping or expecting.

Updating: Having had many more bottles of this, I am more impressed. It is not a thick stout, but it is really delicious. Price really ranges from store to store, so certainly worth buying when I get a good price.",4.45

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Stouts, especially Imperial Stouts, are my favorite style, so I try them whenever I can. Even though Bourbon County changes slightly every year, for me it is the zenith, the benchmark against all others are judged. The viscosity is delightful; other Imperial Stouts are so thin and weak by comparison. And the complexity is amazing. I introduce people to it every year, give them a small glassful without introduction and ask them what they think they are drinking. People are always fascinated by the range of flavors, and only a few guess that it is a beer!
Every year, my friends and I buy up as much as we can get our hands on. And if you can find it on tap, I like it even better.",5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This review is based on a 2020 label date opened in 2022, stored under dark refrigeration. This beer ages well, no doubt.

Look: Very dark, and is about as translucent as used Diesel motor oil, which is to say it is quite opaque. It is a very dark brown in color, with a medium brown head.

Smell and taste: Bourbon (of course), chocolate, tobacco, some dried hay, some smoke but not a lot. and more and more roasted loveliness. The alcohol burn is there, but it really just transports all of the flavors to the nose and tongue and is not overly intrusive. Everything is balanced, which is a characteristic of all of my favorite beers. Take a sip, and contemplate all of the different flavors as they dance across your tongue from start to finish, front to back. There is a lot of variety here.

Feel: As at least one other review mentions, for its massive burst of robust, intense flavor, it is not a thick beer, but is surprisingly thin. It is not a make-or-break for the beer, just an interesting characteristic. ""

Overall: One of my top 10 beers (The old bomber Karbach BBHs, La Fin Du Monde, Avery Reverend, Aventinus, Real Ale Sisyphus, Avery Maharaja, Ranger Creek Wee Heavy, any dark ale from Double Mountain in Oregon, New Belgium Ranger Imperial IPA)

I always drink these out of a Bordeaux style wine glass since it concentrates the scent of the beer. I usually pour one right out of the fridge and drink it slowly over an hour or so, savoring the considerable shifts in flavor as it warms up. The coffee and the chocolate notes become more predominant, and the complexity bursts forth. The finish also becomes more Aventinus like and will linger on the tongue as long as you want it to. There is a strange stage about 20 minutes in when a burnt nut bitterness becomes more apparent amongst all of the other flavors. But, fret not, just wait and it will revert back to its full palate.

I don't love my favorite beers because they score high on this site. I love them because they are fantastic. This is a fantastic beer.",4.84
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"A: when pored the appearance is as black as can be. This beer is so dark, the foam appears to be a dark brown rather than the the typical white. This appearance is how you know this will be a serious stout.

S: There are definitely notes of bourbon in the aroma. You can also detect notes of roasted barley and oak.

T: The taste of this brew is suburb for an imperial stout. There is a rich blend of flavors from the oak, the bourbon and the malts. While there is also some hop presence, its really the bourbon that takes center stage here. This is definitely the gold standard for a barreled aged beer.

M: The mouth feel is very warming. That is to be expected at with a beer with a big abv like this one. This is definitely something you want to drink in the colder weather,

O: Overall Goose island nailed this style. I don't often give 5 star ratings but this brew earned it. It is such a rich imperial stout that drinks very smoothly. It is one of the best beers I have ever drank. Final rating 5/5.",5.0
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Goose Island Bourbon County Stout
Live review. Poured from the 1 pint, 0.9 ounce bottle that I found at a cool bottle shop in Mentor, Ohio about 18 months ago for, if I recall correctly, about $15. 2019 indicated on the neck label. Drink by: 25 AUG 24 08:33 14.7% ALC/VOL printed on the lower part of the label on the body of the bottle.
A: The look does not disappoint. The darkest body with a brief dark brown head which lasts about 10 seconds and I poured generously into a clean, clear snifter. Love this look, even if much of it is to style. 4.5
S: Dark fruits predominate without too much “heat” of alcohol which I expected somewhat due to the high ABV. I certainly pick up some deep, sweet bourbon notes but the dark fruits are front and center. Intriguing and I give it “extra credit” for not being too “hot.” 4.5
T: Wow. So much going on here. Early taste is a LOT of dark fruits, heat of alcohol bourbon notes dancing on my tongue and then dissipating into a long, slow, alcohol slide out to an amazing finish of smooth dark roast malt but that process takes about 2 minutes. 4.5
M: Mouthfeel is surprisingly thin for the style and the beer’s reputation. Mind you, this is NOT a thin beer, just that I had expected one of the fullest, thickest beers but it is not. 3.5
D: Drinkability/Overall: Overall a fantastic beer, one that everyone reading this should seek out. Drinkability is limited by your budget and your sobriety but this is a “night capper” kind of beer. Only a fool would drink several of these in one evening. Intention, in my opinion, is to enjoy one of these in an evening, and frankly share it with someone else. 4.0",4.3

Poured into a chalice-like glass. Color is a very dark blackish and brown mix. Thick and syrup-like with a noticeable alcohol aroma.

Smell is excellent and to me consists of chocolate, plum, coffee, caramel, vanilla, and of course, Bourbon.

The 14.7 ABV brings a nice, warm taste to the experience and I look forward to my next bottle.

Bourbon County Brand Stout,This is a great beer and dont let anyone tell you otherwise. At 14.6% its very smooth and makes for a great special occasion beer. The only even slightly negative thing i could say about it is that it may be a slight bit too thick to drink at any time. If i was full i dont know that id enjoy one. In my opinion this beer is so good that i think people are now talking bad about it just to go against the grain and feel like they better than everyone else who likes it.,4.95
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Not much of a head. Very rich on the nose; bourbon, figs, cola, milk chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. Taste is heavy on the bourbon, with figs, honey, and chocolate, followed by roasted malt and coffee. Hints of vanilla and oak come and go. The bourbon really dominates, more than just about any other BA stout I’ve had. Feel is a bit oily, and the alcohol warmth approaches that of a wine.
I understand why it’s a classic. This beer has some kick, but does so without becoming cloying or unbalanced. Not my favorite, but great nonetheless.",4.38
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"It's obviously a good stout, but it's just too much for me. Very syrupy, very sweet. You get vivid notes of chocolate and bourbon and toffee yet none of it is enjoyable. It simply has none of what I look for in a beer, or even a stout.",2.22
Bourbon County Brand Stout,"Awesome beer in every way. A true favorite.

L: Dark! Dark and thick as motor oil. Even the short head is caramel in color. It is beautiful!
S: Nice aroma akin to the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. The mixture of malty stout and bourbon is heavenly.
T: This isn't an overly complex stout, and it delivers very well on what it promises. Malt, bourbon, and stout. This isn't too say that nothing else is going on. There are underlying flavors that play well together, and the concert of all the flavors together are well-balanced.
F: Thick and smooth! Matches the look beautifully.

S - Sweet up front. Vanilla. Cola and chocolate. Alcohol. Dark fruit. Raisin or cherry. Some bread scents in the back.

T - Sweet taste as follows scent. Lots of dark fruit (prune, date, raisin) up front. Almost the taste of a port wine. Caramel and vanilla in there. A slight wood or oak. Chocolate notes as well. Love the complexity of each taste providing a little bit different each time. Not boozy even after is warms up some further along like other high ABV beers.

F - Really good medium body mouthfeel. Lower carbonation from and aged Beer. Very smooth and drinkable at high ABV

O - This is a great beer. I know there are a lot of ""flavors"" in this line now, but I tried the base beer of the 2021 batch, and it was World-Class. Well worth picking up and adding to the annual rotation.",4.63

Bourbon County Brand Stout,"This is my first review on BeerAdvocate!

Pouring this from a 16.9 oz bottle, the pour produces a nice finger or so of tan head that dissipates after a few minutes. A bit of lace is left around the edge, with light head left bubbling in the middle. Overall a very dark, nearly black pour gives off a strong boozy scent not uncommon in barrel-aged stouts. The aroma is also quite sweet, which for me is always a good sign of a stout with a good body and careful construction. So far, so good.

The first taste is very, very heavy on the tongue. This is an Imperial Stout with a lot going on. It sticks to the inside of your mouth like a stout should and has a sweet-hot initial hit, likely thanks to the very high ABV of 14%. There is a certain candy flavor up front that I am not a huge fan of, but it doesn't stay around for long. Afterward the taste dissolves into almost a cola-like flavor that lingers for a long time. It feels like there are a ton of flavors, including coffee and dried fruit that almost overwhelm anything else.

This is a fine beer. It isn't my favorite stout of all time, but it is an American Imperial Stout, and is amongst the most well-crafted I have ever had. I can see this being someone's go-too Stout when it's in season, but the flavor profile is just a little too sweet for me.

Still, very good.",4.32
Flora Plum,"Original bottling

It is a clear, reddish plum pour with half a finger of pure white head. It looks less thick than many of the HF saisons I have tried, but ""prettier"".

Tart plum bursts from the bottle and fills the room. As I pour it gets even stronger. My salivary glands fire before I even put nose to glass. Such a delicious aroma, it calls, entices, with fresh plum, tart sourdough, raspberry jam, grape must notes, honeysuckle, hints of spicy alcohol and fresh flowers, in perfect balance to create a stunning aroma.

All the flavors of the nose are here, no need to repeat them, balanced perfectly, in a wonderful blend. It ends a lightly jammy whih fades into a tart, fruity linger. As it warms hints of an herbal bitterness enter the mix, quite lightly, and it gets even better.

Medium body for style, light carbonation which works well here, clean as a whistle, with a brilliantly flavored linger that is just right to bring on desire for next sip.

Another masterpiece from the master I regret not tasting fresh. It has either remained or become a beauty of a beer that is an artistic work of intoxicating refreshment",4.76

Pours a clear, yet ever-so-slightly foggy true gold hue, with all but a loose ring of white foam forming, that sticks around permanently. Some lazy effervescence is visible.

Nose: In classic Hill Farmstead form, the aroma is beautifully delicate and fragile, beginning with subtle notes of malt and wheat, with a rustic sort of grainy note about it. Atop this, gentle acidity and beautiful minerality act as a conduit for a melange of bright vinous fruits in the form of lemon, pear, apple, nectarine, white grape, and gooseberry, and then this subtle, yet spectacular dark fruit note that is quietly jammy, sweet, and plummet, almost evoking a hint of grape juice and grape pixie stix. Finally, threads of oak, hay, grass, attic, leather, parchment, wet moss, and petrichor stitch it a together. Absolutely spectacular.

Palate: Immediately, the defining notes of the base beer - Florence, are beautifully showcased here, rounded by maturity. She greets the palate with the most restrained acidity with a hint of lemon-lime, and then that unique floral, fresh coriander-eucalyptus note peaks through. Bright fresh fruity notes of pear, gooseberry, white wine grape, underripe plum, and tart plum skins all play together, surrounded by a racey, vibrant minerality that sparkles over the palate. There is a subtle thread of funk, lending damp earth, moss, hay, wet oak, white grape pomace, river stones, and a whisper if dusty brett, before the lemon-lime and exotic fruity floral notes resurface. A slight minty/camphoraceous element cools the palate, and then the oak comes in to dry out the fruity bits. Flora Plum finishes dry and clean, with a faint hint of grain, and zero acidity.

Mouthfeel/Body: Delicate, light, and crisp, yet managing to avoid being watery or lacking in any way. Perfect gentle acidity, which is complimented by a zippy, sparkling minerality, and lively, but delicate effervescence. Perfectly dry with just a hint of fruity sweetness and plum-skin tartness. Subtle drying oak, and as clean as you could imagine.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular farmhouse ale. I thought blueberry was divine, yet I believe this exceeds it - and I'm a sucker for blueberry. It's just so delicate, elegant, and tasteful, while truly conveying all the character of Florence, softened by oak and time, and delivering this subtle, but beautiful fruity plum influence. There's a reason this beer is so highly revered. Practically flawless, and utterly Hill Farmstead.",4.62
Flora Plum,"Displaying a unique color of lightly foggy pale orange or even crayon peach, a moderately dense white blanket settles down to a curled, quietly active ring.

The nose has faint, mildly dusty oak pairing with a pleasantly subtle floral perfume that's just hypnotizing.

Uniquely and cleanly juicy, a lightly herbal, drupe-influenced sort of pear character with just a kiss of tartness is dreamily weaved throughout the zippy effervescence of its satisfyingly palate massaging medium-light body before coming to a vanishing semi-dry swallow.

Flora Plum is such a perfectly quaffable yet delicately complex brew, it's beyond words. I love being floored by subtly delicate complexity like this. The experience is pure, even without a discernible Hill expression. It seems to even transcend that already high bar.",4.84
Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"Appearance: Arrives a hazy golden color with a one finger head; good retention and clumpy lacing

Smell: Ruby red grapefruit with stone fruit elements

Taste: Very juicy. with nectarine and peach elements emerging; ruby red grapefruit, through the middle, with some pith and a hint of pepper; long lasting finish

A great IPA",4.67
Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"16oz. can into a Founders snifter.

Pours a pale pastel yellow with a coarse 0.5 finger white head. Nose is citrus, pear, and apple. All underripe. Actually a bit more muted than I thought it would be. Some cane sugar and starfruit in there as well. Beer opens grapefruit, pear, and apple. An interesting take on the tropical fruit flavor profile. The middle yields notes of citrus, a touch of grassiness, and more pear skin. End is more pear, apple, and citrus fruit. Finish bone dry with an aftertaste of citrus rind. Body is light to medium with ample carbonation. Prickly and foamy in the mouth and aggressive going down. Probably the dryest beer I've had to date. A long, lingering aftertaste.

Good, not great. That body is something to experience though.",4.22
Ghost In The Machine - Double Dry-Hopped,"Pours a very cloudy yellow color with a small foamy head. Juicy, juicy, citrus, and piney aroma. It smells so fresh. Canned on 11/11/21.

O - Top notch DDH NEIPA,",4.6

Overall - tasty but over-hyped in my opinion",4.56
Headroom,On tap at the tasting room. Cloudy/milky orangish/yellow pour with a white head. More tangy than I’m accustomed too from Trillium. Grapefruit and citrus hop notes give way to hints of pine and resin. A bit more unbalanced with a bitter hoppy presence. Average mouthfeel with a good body.,3.77

S: Stonefruit, cantaloupe, grapefruit.
T: stonefruit, orange juice, citrus Grapefruit resiny bitterness. Touch of dank.
F: juicy and fairly thick and creamy.
Overall: A signature trillium style ipa. This is really balanced for a hazy hop bomb though. No hop burn.",4.42
Headroom,16oz. can poured into a beer can shaped glass. A bit of citrus with some pine finish. Dank. Very glad to try this but this seems to fall ever so slightly short of reputation.,4.5
Headroom,"Sweet tangerine citrus, tropical hoppy, bready/biscuity, and dank nose on this one! Taste follows with a nice tropical hoppy and piney-dank bitter bite...some grapefruit citrus bitterness shows up on the backend. This is so soft and juicy on the palate. Outstanding!",4.52
Headroom,"A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. This is a really good-looking NEIPA - juicy, milkshake-like burnt yellow with a near-1-finger white head on top.

S: Nose does NOT disappoint - it jumps out of the glass with a bushel of fruit: pineapple, melon, ripe apricot/peach, a touch of lime.

T: Pretty much follows the nose, with pineapple, ripe melon, mango, tangerine, orange creamsicle, then finishing with a lemon-lime bitterness and key lime pie. The 8% ABV is not noted at all, though I think I'm getting a little warmth in the belly.

M: Medium to full-bodied, creamy feel to this one - more creamy than juicy, if that makes sense. Real nice feel to it, challenges Tree House's best in that regard.

O: Phenomenal. A really, really good NEIPA.",4.67
Atrial Rubicite,"2020 vintage (Blend 10/April 2020); consumed on 7/31/2022

Pours a stunningly vivid, blood-red hue sporting deep ruby highlights along with a short-lived finger of fluffy, soft magenta foam; a few islands of paper-thin cap are temporarily encompassed by an equally thin collar and minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass with any longevity.

Aroma is awash in fresh raspberry jam as silky vanillins underscore a gentle funk; wisps of Sangiovese impress an increasingly juicy red grape must, while oaky, lacto-funk evolves in turn over time.

Taste brings raspberry jam cut with a level lacto-funk upfront; red Jolly Rancher is eased with subtle dry oak imparting red wine tannins and subtle minerality over the mid-palate and into the back end, where musty, wet basement undertones are interspersed along the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body with a subdued, moderate carbonation; a glossy lacto-cooling washes waves of funky brightness over the palate, while a tannic wetness lingers on the back end, drying quietly into the close.

Jammy raspberry reverberates through a tannic silk and soft, funky underscore, leaving a wild ale perceptively hybridized by waves of dense fruit saturating rustic subtleties; a playfully approachable complexity throughout.",4.4
Atrial Rubicite,"Look - Love the thick raspberry puree look
Smell - great raspberry tartness
Taste - fantastic raspberries with it being tart but not overly tart
Feel - medium full body and a littler carb but still really nice
Overall - just delicious",4.49

Double Galaxy,"Canned on: ?????

A - Dark golden orange color with moderately dense, bright white lacing that's very creamy looking.

S - Dank passion fruit, peach, and citru with dank, spicy citrus rind on the nose.

T - Dank citrus and peach take center stage on this one followed with pineapple, spicy citrus rind, and some peppery notes.

M - Big medium body with a soft, smooth texture

O - As expected, this is a pretty fantastic D-IPA. Not a 100 (IMO) but it's up there!",4.37
Double Galaxy,"This is very close to a perfect IPA in my mind.
Great representation of Galaxy hops.
Nice white head. Sticks around.
Smells like candied pineapple and bubble gum.
Taste has the pineapple on the front but a nice bitter backbone.
Body isn’t too thick which makes it remarkably drinkable",4.62
Double Galaxy,"can into glass
Canned 8 days prior to review.
Medium thick, frothy white head, that quickly thins out. Vivid, cloudy, medium orange color, with much intricate lacing to start off with. The aroma has a candied malt, guava, pineapple, a little mixed sweet spice underneath. Flavors of candied tangerine peel, guava, passion fruit, with a bit of help from some medium toast malt, in the background, to fill out the body and some of the flavors. There is a bright effervescence to it, as well. The finish is largely a mixed citrus peel glow, then a moderate bite.",4.06
Double Galaxy,"Had this at Blackback Pub in Waterbury. Truly an outstanding beer! Excellent color, smell and feel. I wish I was able to drink more than 3 of these… so damn good",4.75
Double Galaxy,Growler. Cloudy yellow pour with a white head. Tangy citrus hops dominate the beer. Straight forward with minimalistic malt presence. Clean and refreshing. God body and mouthfeel.,3.99
Double Galaxy,"Canned 09/15/20. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.

A: Hazy gold with 1-2 finger frothy off-white head with excellent retention and sturdy lacing.

S: Herbal undertones to the hop aroma with minty, peppery, melon coming through strongest, with some pineapple and red grapefruit in the background.

T: Flavor is also melon-heavy with some lemongrass and herbal notes in the mid-palate and pineapple and orange in the finish. Pale maltiness is substantial and lends light grainy sweetness. Bitterness is medium with mild fruity esters.

M: The feel is a bit high in minerality for me with a little chalkiness in the finish. Body is medium with low-medium carbonation.

O: A great NEIPA with a more bitter edge which I like. Thanks to my generous friend Eric for giving me the chance to try this exceptional beer from an exceptional brewer — did not disappoint.",4.24
Double Galaxy,"Canned 9/15/20
Consumed 10/18/20

As with all the best NEDIPAs, this is a beautiful beer. If it didn't taste and smell so amazing, I'd wonder if they made beers just to look pretty on Instagram, but this matches on the other notes. I love that the ones from the Northeast do have a bit more of a bitter dry finish than the Midwestern ones that I drink most often (being from Chicago.) I DO wish they'd change to a 16oz can. There's a reason why that's so popular now as a format size, and with the dryer finish, I could really drink more than 12oz in a sitting. There's not as much on the nose as the super fresh Hop Butcher's that I most often drink, but that might be due to the can being a month old. I still get nice hops and bitter grapefruit rind on the nose and pallet. It's a wonderfully balanced beer. Will HF ever expand and increase distribution? If so, people will undoubtedly say their quality has dropped even if it doesn't. I'd love to see this in my area. Don't ever pass this one up!",4.69
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,Great dank hop floral nose. Almost a little bit gritty on the mouthfeel. Flavor was as good as you're going to get. Def a beer you should try if you can.,4.86
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"Canned 11/23/20 and enjoyed on 12/02/20. Pours with some moderate effervescence with some moderate head retention and lacing. Color reminiscent of orange juice. Complex scents of pine, mango, pineapple, fresh cut grass. Similar flavor profile- lots of tropical fruits, orange zest, with some noticeable hop bite. Soft, fluffy mouthfeel. Nice oily bitterness that lingers on the palate. I really enjoy galaxy hopped beers and this is a solid one that drinks bigger than it is, more like a DIPA. Really big and bold flavors.",4.59
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"Can dated 9/15/20. Poured into Trillium tulip shaped glass. Looks like dirty orange juice. Great smell of hops, but not so much as other Trillium DDH varieties I’ve had. Taste is really well balanced — not overpowering with citrus — with a long, ever-so-slightly bitter, lingering finish. Doesn’t stand out in any singular, exaggerated way, but a very nicely balanced IPA. Nicely done.",4.75
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"Pours a 1/4” head and lacy suds on top of hazy yellow/orange body. Nice refreshing mouthfeel and the double dry hops comes through in the taste, and just a touch lingering afterwards. Tangerine, kumquat, pineapple, and sweet citrus aroma.",4.56
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street,"L: Super Hazy yellow with a tint of orange and a bubbly head that dissipates leaving modest lacing.

S: Bright and resinous tropical fruits. Mango, peach, and pineapple. The malt showcases itself surprisingly well with some candied bread.

T: Firm bitterness, moves into a huge hop flavor of mango, peach, and pine resin. The malt provides a decent backbone with some candied crystal malt presence.

F: Dry, but somewhat creamy from a generous dose of wheat or oats.

Overall: A stellar NEIPA, insanely hoppy. You must try this beer if you are a hophead.",4.4

Taste (4.75): Citrusy, but can't tell exactly what ""candied"" fruit. More bitterness and hops. Bit of dankness. More dankness than typical NEIPA

Coconut Vibes,"Pours black with a still look. It has oily legs as you swirl the glass. Aroma is coconut water and soy sauce. Toasted coconut, chocolate, caramel, and roasty and toasty malts all come thru, leaning lightly towards 'sweet'. Flavor profile is the same, big coconut water mixed in with hearty toasty and roasty malts. Chocolate comes on at the finish. Soy sauce permeates the middle, distracting a touch from the rest of the profile. Mouth feel is thick, creamy, and decadent. Overall, big and bold, with a clear and intentional focus on coconut, as the label would suggest. It's a soothing pillow of coconut.

Poured from a 750mL bottle. Reviewed from notes.",4.47
Coconut Vibes,"750ml bottle. Poured out an opaque, jet-black color with a small, light brown head of foam. It left sudsy trails of lace on the glass.

Coconut Vibes,"2021 release - Drank on 12/25/21.

King Sue,"Well-deserved hype for this one. Finally found it relatively fresh, canned 08/18 and consumed 09/22. Super smooth, delicious Citra all the way, and the IBUs hardly noticeable given the balance achieved. Hope I can find its siblings fresh as well.",4.59
King Sue,"Pours a hazy grapefruit yellow with a four finger head that leaves beautiful lacing on the glass. Aroma is orange, pineapple and a hint of mango. Taste is lighter than expected, very orange with pineapple mixed in. Nicely bitter but not overly so. There is a slight sweetness to the brew. Nicely done.",4.21
King Sue,It's just so wonderful and drinkable and sniffable and did I say drinkable. IT's great stuff and T Rex on the can is cool beans. My problem is finding it fresh. The store I usually go to has stuff on the shelf that's past the best buy date and I'm not spending 18 bucks on a four pack of 16 ozs. This same store was selling single 16 oz cans of 10 day old King for ten bucks. Perhaps I should talk to the manager.,4.42
King Sue,"King Sue Double IPA by Toppling Goliath. 7.8% ABV 100+ IBUs. This is really interesting…it’s got some bitterness up front and at the end but not nearly what the IBUs would indicate. Nice orange, mango and some pineapple in the middle with a little lemon or grapefruit at the end. Fair amount of carbonation as indicated by the head. Very nice lacing. Not quite the same color as the pictures on the brewery website…more pale golden yellow than the light orange on the website. Really good….",4.48
King Sue,Can. Murky with lasting head and lace. Extremely fruity pineapple and citrus aroma with some raw dough. Medium sweetness buried under the juicy tartness with almost a hint a grain. Doughy full body. Lively carbo stops short of a bite. Juicy juicy juicy. A classic NEDIPA if you like that sort of thing. I don't.,3.01
King Sue,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Smells of bright citrus and floral hops. Tastes of citrus and floral hops, nice flavor. Beer is medium to full bodied yet easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",4.24
King Sue,"What can I say? Hop onslaught. Hop smoothie. Hopadelic. Hop juice galore. Poured into a snifter at 48F. Looks like straight orange juice with a fluffy white head that lasts forever. Smells like orange juice and white bread. Tastes of orange rind. Thick consistency that is somewhat filling. Alcohol is there, but not outstanding due to the level of hop intensity. Overall 5 across the board. Would recommend this beer to everyone who likes citrus anything.",5.0
King Sue,"Super hazy/cloudy yellow/orange like pineapple juice with a touch of orange. The head is substantial, retains well and manages some nice lace.
The aroma is grapefruit, pineapple and pine resin with a hint of light caramel malt in the background. The taste is similar to the aroma but with the addition of Cara Cara oranges, lemon, apricot, mango and passion fruit, slightly sweet with a light malt background, balanced by plenty of grapefruit pulp and pine resin bitterness. The finish is dry with lingering pine resin and a white pepper note.
The body is full with moderate carbonation, smooth but with a fell of light pulp content even if not visible.
Altogether this is an amazingly tasty and enjoyable brew, everything is balanced for maximum impact that makes the ABV almost unnoticed..",4.66
King Sue,"On tap at the Irish River in Louisville. The color is like a mix of pineapple juice and grapefruit. And so is the nose. Very smooth hazy IPA. Not an overload of any flavor. Not even too boozy. Such a nice blend of grapefruit, tropical, and hops.",4.25
King Sue,"From Chicago and I've been drinking a lot of the weekly hop butcher which is almost always amazing, Phase 3's dipas, Microphone, Riverlands these stand out too. But over the past few months theyve all been hit or miss. And for $20 a 4 pack it hurts when you miss. Then i came back to an old favorite--Toppling Golliath. its got just about everything i like about all these beers, everything i hope for every time i by the new weekly. BUT HERES THE THING. King Sue has ""it"" every time. Real big fresh hoppy tones (citra) but so fresh, like they use real hops vs canned or dried hops if i had to guess. The pale ale version pseudo sue is just as good.",4.83
King Sue,"Purchased at Pennridge Beverage, Perkasie, PA. $22.50/4pk (16oz cans)

Pours a hazy, golden color. A one finger, white head on the initial pour that fades to a sticky residue on the glass.

Wonderful fruity, lemony aroma.

A citrusy, reiseny, slightly bitter taste. Slightly sweet. Very good IPA.

Medium consistency, medium carbonation.

My first brew from Toppling Goliath and I was impressed. I would definitely seek this out in the future. Cheers!",4.4
King Sue,Had on tap at Glory Beer Bar & Kitchen in Philadelphia. This was a delicious New England-style DIPA with enormous depth of flavor and aroma. One of the best examples I've had of a style that I truly enjoy.,4.83
King Sue,"Full disclosure first: I'm usually not a fan of hazy IPAs as they are often too sweet, too murky, and not bitter enough for an IPA. But there are exceptions, and King Sue is certainly a great one. The look: King Sue pours with a beautiful white head that lasts, on top of an unattractive yellowish dishwater look. If you don't mind the murky dirty look, you'll be fine.

The smell is hoppy, classic Citra, with more fruity complexity. The taste is grapefruit and other tropical fruit flavors. It's less tart than some Citra beers. The big plus is that it's got solid bitterness as an integral part of the package. I don't like hazy IPAs that are basically alcoholic fruit juice, but King Sue is a real IPA, with bitterness and a noticeable ABV kick. This beer packs a flavor punch.

The feel is very thick, almost like a fruit smoothie.

Overall, it's certainly the best New England IPA I've had, with a standout flavor profile.",4.46
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Likely the best pale ale I've ever had. Just hits every note - perfect balance, ton of flavor. If I could have this in my beer fridge at all times, I would. It just curb stomps the vast majority of pale ales I've had. Great citrus flavors, nice body. Surprising high ABV for a pale, which probably helps the flavor profile, but I'm not taking that as a detraction - this is a fantastic beverage.",4.58
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Deep orange in color. No head created, at all. Nose was the least desirable quality, mainly due to not much there, especially given the color and extreme citrus taste. Taste is the magical moment. Superb beer.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"2022-03-06
16oz can served in a stemless wineglass. Dated 01/25/22. Received from @WunderLlama in NBS BIF #14.

Pours super murky whitish yellow with a medium sized head that dissipates into a medium sized ring and a fairly large but thin island of fine bubbles in the center of the glass. Smell...well, for starters I been catching whiffs of it for where I set it, arm's length away (and I have long arms). Smell is gorgeously tropical juicy, pineapple/mango/orange. Lingering resin sense that is difficult to extricate from the tropical juicy stuff.

Taste is much pithier / redolent of fruit skin than the aroma suggests. It's bitter up front, lots of resin, and the tropical juiciness is strong but lurking not-so-subtly in the background.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry / drying, slightly gritty. This is a very good beer.",4.31
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a pale, but somehow full and hazy yellow with a large-pored white head that dissipates quickly without leaving any lacing. No floaters.

Smell: Fresh citrus notes. Mainly lemon with hints of grapefruit.

Taste: Yellow citrus fruits. Fresh and hoppy. Zesty and bitter body with a dry finish. Low sweetness.

Feel: Very juicy with a medium carbonation and a sharp zesty punch.

Overall: Full and juicy Pale Ale with a strong focus on fresh citrus fruits. Could easily be mistaken for a DIPA. Very challenging compared to other Pale Ales with its full body and its dry finish. Great beer. Very intense.",4.49
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Pours small head. Disappears into a juice like substance. Classic trillium. They sucks with head.
That’s ok tho because the beer has a great pineapple grapefruit oniony nose.

Really delicious. I like the bitterness. Something a lot of northeast IPAs don’t have.
Really good pale overall.",4.32
Fort Point Pale Ale - Double Dry Hopped,"Yellow, just slightly less bright than orange juice, and totally opaque. White, very soapy head, dissipates rather quickly and doesn't leave much lacing.

Cloudy, medium orange, with some yellow/gold highlights, for the look. Very fruity, tangelo peel and some grapefruit peel, in the aroma. Rather thin bodied & tasting.

Society & Solitude #4,"I’ve been fortunate to have tried some of the best ipas. This #4 is truly refined, smooth. Perfect for a toast!

Society & Solitude #4,"Pours a very pretty and bright pale with the slights shades of orange/gold. It is very cloudy but it is not murky, it looks so in the picture but the edges have a slight clarity to them. Perfectly white creamy looking head, some generous lacing with almost every sip.

The smell is so so lively, like bursting out of the glass. Super pungent peach, citrus, also hints of tropical fruits.

The taste follows the nose mainly in the same peachy citrus I first got from the nose. There’s also a nice grassiness that I didn’t pick up on in the nose along with the slightest touch of herbal green flowers.

This beer has a medium body but it is such a soft and pleasant beer to drink. Semi dry finish with a medium bitterness that goes down so smooth and clean.",4.41

Lou Pepe - Framboise,"Vibrant ruby with a soft head settling to a persistent creamy white film and thick collar.

Taste is full of seedy raspberry with a mild, balanced acidity that's woodier and a little funkier than Gambrinus. The soft fluffy body comes across as a bit more delicate than Gambrinus, and a little less sour. The semi-dry finish brings up notes of toasty cracker and a little char, but overall LPF is really expressive of fruit without the added acid that often comes along with it.",4.44
Abricot Du Fermier,"Appearance - The beer was the color of an apricot. It was golden orange with some red hues. Carbonation was visible.

Smell - The apricot seemed dry in the nose, but you could easily can detect a funk of a saison.

Taste - At the front, the apricots were quite sour. It really tingled the sides of the tongue. There was an undercurrent of fruit sweetness. Toward the back, the funk of the saison came through and provides a sense of balance.

Mouthfeel - The body was vicious, almost like an actual fruit smoothie.

Overall - I can definitely appreciate a saison like this.",4.4
Abricot Du Fermier,"Pours an apricot orange with a little haze to the translucency. Transparency drops towards murky when the last of the bottle is poured into the glass. Head never forms. Aroma is apricot right off the cuff, although it's mild and nuanced into the profile. Stone, lemongrass, and earth add some more depth. It has a pleasant tartness to it, leaning into a little acidity. Flavor profile takes the acidity up a notch, especially when served at fridge temperature. The acidity wanes as the beer warms. Apricot adds some sweetness, and is more forward than the nose, taking up a more dominate role. It's still well balanced and nuanced into the flavor profile. Cellar stone, earthy malts, grass, and lemon zest create the rest of the profile, all accompanied by some minor tartness. Mouth feel is still in effervescence, delivering a smooth texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a tart apricot saison that delivers tasty simplicity.

Oude Geuze Vintage,"Lightly foggy burnt orange to amber, nearly glowing, with a tall off-white foam head settling to unevenly airy, bubbly lumps that are somewhat translucent, translating more to a khaki hue, leaving tiny spots of lace on the glass.

Smell is both more oaky and peppery than regularly OG, a little dusty even, but also brighter and spicier, in a pleasant, sense-awakening way. Adding to the allure are hints of dried, gooey apricot, fresh fig and white grape.

The medium body's lively effervescence perks up the palate, again with surprisingly bright, zippy characteristics. It's super refreshing and also very pleasantly balanced on the palate, quaffable to a frightening degree, particularly for a bottle so hard to find.

It's like a mimosa with white grape juice instead of orange, while very fine white oak adds complementary complexity without any undesirable features, and barely a touch of funk. Again here it's more peppery, yet not as toasty as regular OG, but it simultaneously gives a feel like you can crunch down on it before the frothy light carbonation dies into a perfectly clean, semi-dry swallow. It consistently reminds me of nelson, my favorite hop.

Absolutely scrumptious, with an unbelievable mouthfeel.",4.77

The aroma starts with a sweetness that reminds me of papaya and guava (in a word, tropical). The hop is mostly floral with a bit of black pepper thrown in.

The malt is dryer than I expected, certainly less tropical than the smell. The hop is more pronounced producing a bitter bite. The body is neutral as is the carbonation. Long bitter aftertaste.",4.15

Zombie Dust,"Acquired in a trade with @Turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in June 2022.

Look: Pours a burnished, bright orange, with a white, persistent head. Leaves lacing on the glass as it goes down.

Nose: Oh yeah! Big, bitter hops, clean orange citrus, caramel malt. This is a throwback to the good old days!

Taste: Even better than the nose! It has a big bitter hop burn that's awesomely bracing. Flavour wise there's a dank resinous note that gives way to clean orange and pineapple citrus. The finish is uber clean.

Mouth: It's like chewing a beer - you know it's in your mouth and it doesn't disappoint. There's high carbonation that leaves a lot of carbonic prickling on the tongue and in the throat, and on the swallow there's a warning kick, presumably from the hops. Awesome.

Overall: This is a fantastic throwback to an old-school, big, bitter, citrusy pale ale. Great beer!

Cheers!",4.43
Zombie Dust,"Not worth the high rating in my opinion. Tasted very much like a normal IPA. Rich orange color with citrus and strong hoppy aromas. Nothing different from what I’d expect from a regular IPA. Feels and tastes of a heavy malt with a smooth finish. The smoothness clearly gives it the edge, but outside of that not a 100 rated beer. On the positive side, double thumbs up for the artwork on the can! The Zombie King coming right out of a graphic novel gets a hard 5/5, but the beer gets a slightly above average rating.",4.27

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 vintage

We’re nearing the end of the BIF beers I got from @Eziel back in February, and this one is a heavy hitter. This has been a big want for me for a while, so it’s awesome to finally be able to try it. Let’s see what this famoud spicy Stout is really all about

Pours nearly pitch black with 2 fingers of reddish brown head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is highly complex in the nose, not too peppery and balanced in its sweetness. I’m picking up on aromas of cacao nibs, vanilla bean, chili pepper, spicy whiskey, burnt coffee, sweet toffee, brown sugar, and light charred oak

This is a bit restrained in taste, perhaps due to the age but I still really enjoy it. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark chocolate, roasty coffee, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, spicy whiskey, toasted oak, cinnamon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of milk chocolate, chipotle pepper, vanilla bean, caramel, toasted oak, earthy whiskey, and burnt coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and earthy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a lingering heat

While I enjoyed this, I’d hardly put it on legendary status. Again, maybe it’s the age so I’d love to try it fresh, but even still",4.31
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 ""Amalie Arena"" edition...large capped bottle.

Pours very dark with no light shining through, next to no cap or lacing.

Dark chocolate and fudge brownies on the sniff.

Super smooth, nice complexity exhibited by the notes of more chocolate/brownies/cinnamon/dark malts.

Delicious creation, no doubt aided by a few years in the bottle....get some of this fine nectar, if ya have the opportunity.",4.42
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2018 Vintage

750ml bottle - poured into a balloon stem at 50°F. Huge thanks to DonnieT79 for this longtime want!

Pours an unbelievable slick jet black colour - absorbing every photon of light, with the single darkest head on a beer that I've ever seen, forming - like a grade school volcano, it foams up - fine and sudsy, with the colour of light coffee beans, and then receding to a huge, persistent coarse bubbly collar that lasts forever. 4.75

Nose: Incredibly rich. Almost like a concentrate. Deep, bold roasted malts with a particularly Russian-style accord lend bitter baker's chocolate, cacao, Peruvian coffee, black treacle, toffee, caramel, marzipan, and vanilla. A slight, dense fruity thread lends a deep raisiny PX sherry note, with a hint of fig, blueberry, and dried cherry. I'm failing to pick up any chilies or cinnamon, but there is a unique warm spice element, lending a hint of earthiness. Not very Mexican, but it smells delicious. 4.25

Palate: The legendary Hunahpu greets the palate with an expertly dialed-in balance between malt sweetness and roast. Immediately, it lets you know that it is not trying to be a Mexican wedding cake - this is a Russian imperial stout, with a bold, heavy roast, deep, dark, bitter complexion, and leaning drier on the sweetness scale. Roasty is the main theme here. Bitter cocoa, charred malts, burned sugar, and burned vanilla lead the way, with an underpinning of marzipan and malty sweetness. The pepper is there if you really squint, but rather than lending a chili heat, it's more of an earthy, dry spice. Spice as in spices, not heat. I'm not picking up on cinnamon, perhaps due to its age, but there's definitely some type of spice character that's lending an earthy aromatic quality. It grows drier, nudging out any sweetness, and the charred malt takes hold, upping the dry, bitter factor. The faintest little glow of pepper warmth emerges, and the stout concludes with deep, bitter roast, cacao, and an almost tannic bite to it, which lingers, resurfacing with an espresso- like aftertaste. 4.0

Mouthfeel/Body: Despite its foreboding motor oil appearance, Hunahpu is quite drinkable. A bold, rich, heavy brew, but he's quite fluid, with a medium-full body, and very minimal viscosity. There's some fine, subtle fizzy effervescence, but it's relegated to the background, and only just contributes enough. The chilies warm only the gums, and it concludes with a drying, tannic roasty squeeze. 4.25

Overall: This is a tricky one for me. I know this is revered as a legend, and was once highly sought-after, and perhaps the age didn't treat this one the best, but I have a hard time falling in love with it. It's a bit roasty and bitter for my taste, and feel it trends more in the classic Russian style than anything else. It's a great RIS, especially if you like them bitter and roasty, and the hint of pepper is a nice twist, but I keep,wishing that it were just a touch sweeter, less roasty, with more caramel/toffee/vanilla/malt, and less cacao/char/blackened bite. I can certainly see how the right person would adore this though. I just find the roast a bit overbearing.  3.75",4.08
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Well my wife thinks this beer is too big for me to finish in one sitting. She's upset this is 25 oz and she thinks i should only be drinking a bomber a night, which is 22 oz. So this experience begins with stress and tension. And a couple eye rolls. I purchased this from a private seller for $40, which is probably way too much to pay but i can't get this around here in Ohio, and I'd heard so much about this beer i had to try it. So every whale has its price i suppose. Glad to be trying a beer from Tampa as I've been watching some interviews toady with Shock G, AKA Humpty Hump, about the history of hip hop, and he's from Tampa. Poured up deep dark brown with a darkly tan one inch head, a shade darker than khaki. It quickly dissipated into a floating ring around the glass. To be honest, this smells like wet metal, iron, blood. And a little chocolate, dark berry, and thick dark sugary things like molasses. I'm actually getting a lot of plum from this taste, plum and raisin and dates. More plum than ""Plum Tuckered out"" by Hoppin Frog. Very sweet, heavy and dark. A little burned tasting. Slight cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla on the back end. Although the description says there's some Scoville units on this one, I can't detect any spiciness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium thick with moderate effervescence. Overall, it is very good, but i am not as thoroughly impressed as i expected to be. This is rated 100 on this website, and i think it tastes really good, but I'm not going to be that generous, as i don't think there's anything particularly unique about the brew. Maybe i'm just sullied by my wife's remarks and hope she just goes in and smokes a big bowl so she can get high and forget about the fact i'm drinking this whole thing tonight. So much for $40. Maybe better luck next time.",3.75

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"Abyss black body; fizzy carbonation percolating up through the depths; initial decent head yet it quickly dissipates to a thin fizzy ring dancing around the circumference of the glass. Outstanding aroma; tropical fruit sweetness with a rich bitter chocolate element; chili peppers. The taste multiplies the smell sensations; chili pepper spiciness with cinnamon overtones; cocoa and bitter chocolate; star anise. Heavy body; slick and oily on the palate; warm with chili heat and boozy warmth; sticky residual sugars coat the palate and offset the warmth notes with a sweet mouthfeel quality.

2020 edition, unknown ABV (the 2021 version is 11.8% ABV). This beer was made available to me out of the blue, and what treat this is. Many chili and high ABV beers suffer in the head retention department, and that seems to be the case hear, but everything climbs to a high degree afterwards in the sensory appeal department. This is one awesome imperial stout augmented with a devilish chili pepper kick.",4.62
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout,"2020 release. Received from @roguer. Poured into a Cigar City tulip glass. It pours almost jet black with a creamy, medium mocha-colored head and lacing that dissipated quickly. Its nose features roasted malt, caramel, cocoa, cinnamon, freshly-brewed coffee, tobacco smoke, dark fruit, peppers, and subtle but distinct bourbon. The flavor is ridiculous! It opens with cocoa and coffee, along with mellow peppers, black cherry, and cinnamon. All the flavors are delicate and they blend beautifully. The bourbon notes are subtle and enhance the other flavors. It's so easy to drink. The mouth feel is creamy and remarkably lite for 10.2% . Overall, Hunahpu's is everything I thought it would be - and more. It's delicious and perfect either to pair with a hearty meal or for casual drinking. I'm grateful to finally drink this white whale.",4.54

A: slight oak and cocoa overpowered by cinnamon and a spiciness

Notes via stream of consciousness: A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden/brass colored body. The head appears to be holding quite well. The aroma is fairly mild for an NEIPA but offers up passionfruit, nectarine, and a light touch of citrus. The taste is fuller and more complex with notes of orange, pineapple, juicy apple, and distant lemon/lime. The malt is basic, most likely with 2-row, wheat, and oats although I can't specifically taste the wheat or oats. A solid bitterness backs it and it finishes dry with some quickly passing fruit that leaves a soft grassiness, bitterness, and ""hop bite"" lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue. It's fluffy and smooth with plenty of proteins. The head held up really well and it's left some very interesting to look at lace all around the glass. All in all I don't think that Green is Treehouse's best beer by any stretch but it's a solid, well balanced, and highly drinkable beer.
Review #7,968",4.34
Green,"Gorgeous pastel body; yellow-orange appearance; huge head, dense and creamy texture, rocky and white. Peach, pineapple and mango aroma; faint notes of oats and biscuit. Citrus-forward flavor with a sharp, phenol and alcohol bitterness; biscuit-like malt undertone. Heavy body; velvety; juiciness cut with a strong boozy dryness.

Feel: Smooth and juicy. Very dry finish.

Overall: With Very Green and Very Gggreennn being two of my absolute favorites from Tree House, I was a bit disappointed by this one. No question it's a great beer, but I was just expecting more of the complexity of its siblings. However, it's a fresh and crushable beer and drinks very smoothly.",4.29
Green,"Hazy shades of yellow with a finger of white foam and lacing abounding. Dank and piney hops give off a cornucopia of fruits: clementine, grapefruit, lime, mango and guava. Taste has powerful bitterness from the pine forward hops, citrus pith, pineapple rind, lime, and melon rind. Feel has mild oxidation with the intense hops, mild juiciness is pleasant and cooling, body is a little thin. A good hop bomb, but not the 63rd best beer in the world",4.34

Green,"can into glass
Bought at brewery.
Canned 8 days prior to review.
Quite frothy, quickly dissipating, white head. Fairly murky, medium orange with some amber overtones, to the look. Mango, guava, candied tangelo peel, a little medium roast caramel malt, emerges out of the mix. Seems like there is a whiff of some nutmeg/allspice, or such, buried deep in the aroma. A nice melange of some Mandarin orange peel, a bit of medium light toasted malt, underlying, and a whiff of guava/passion fruit, deep in the taste somewhere. There is some lightness to this beer and it finishes mainly with a little tingly, glowing, Mandarin orange/tangelo peel bite. Definitely well done.",4.28
Green,"Depp color reminds me of fresh orange juice. Head is very white that allows lacing to caress the glass. The nose is everything the can describes, juicy, sorbet, tangerine.

Notes via stream of consciousness: A two finger thick head of off-white rests atop a murky golden body with an orange sheen. The aroma isn't as strong as I expected but it delivers some orange and passionfruit over a sweetish and grainy malt base. The flavor is bright and vibrant with a clear note of tangerine backed by passionfruit, nectarine, apricot, and mango. The malt is delicately sweetish, bready, and lightly oat-like. The bitterness is moderate and yet it finishes dry due at least in part to some hop acidity. In the mouth it's medium bodied but it feels a little fuller due to all of the extra proteins giving it a fluffy feel. It's smooth but that hop burn gives it a little bit of an edge. The head has held up really well and I've still got a creamy, but more importanty complete, surface covering. The lacing covers quite a bit and looks like a drawing of trees out of a book of scary stories. The aroma is better on their ""Very Hazy"", and I've scored it better overall, but for my money I prefer this easier drinking version.
Review #7,975",4.37
Haze,"Lovely golden orange body; cloudy; thick head, white and sculpted and long lasting. An interesting aroma; like a sage / cucumber mix; faint bit of citrus. The taste follows along the lines of the smell; stronger sense of cucumber rind bitterness; biscuit-like malt flavor. Heavy body; moderate acidity; somewhat juicy, somewhat dry on the palate.

All I can say is the smell and taste are weird. I don't recall tasting anything like this. If there is supposed to be a stronger citrus presence, it's missing in this sample. If anything, the hop profile seems like some weird combination of Motueka and Nelson Savin hops. Motueka has never thrilled me, but Nelson Savin can be very interesting. Still, there must be a reason it (currently) has a 100 score on BA, but I certainly don't understand it.

Pouring temperature: 40 °F; canning data: THEY'RE EVERYWHERE 03/16/22",3.59
Haze,"I have been drinking IPA's for at least ten years now and a friend gave me this after helping him with repair work around his house. I don't need to rate this with regards to taste, smell, mouth feel.... As soon as I took the first pull, I can tell you it was one of (if not the best) IPA's I've ever had. The combinations of fruit notes are extraordinary and once you give yourself a chance to absorb the flavors, you'll understand what I mean. Drink this Beer!!!",4.93
Haze,"16oz can at share. Hazy orange golden pour with a small foamy white head. Aroma is stone fruit with light tropical acents. Sweet, fruity taste, mango, peaches, zesty, smooth.",4.13
Haze,"One month old. Can to wine glass.

Look: Pours a light hazy orange with a foamy white head leaving a good amount of lacing. No floaters visible.

Smell: Sweet orange and tangerine combined with tropical notes of papaya as well as some peach.

Taste: Orange, tangerine and grapefruit, also peach and papaya. Ripe, but not overripe. Medium sweetness, medium zestiness and a slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Very juicy. Generally smooth with nuanced sharp notes.

Overall: Beautifully balanced beer with a soft fruity body and some edges. While Very Hazy and Very Hhhazyyy were a bit to sharp for my taste, this one just hits the spot.",4.56
Haze,"Had the perfect excuse to visit the treehouse this past weekend. Was meeting up with a friend in Western, MA before conquering the slopes in Vermont. This is an absolute dream of a tailgate beer. I have only had Haze one other time, the Brady return game to Foxboro when we were pleasantly surprised that Tree House was being sold in the stadium. My goodness, what a delicious liquid. Massive citrus nose with grapefruit notes and several other tropical flavors. Taking one of these down after a few runs was an absolute dream. Refreshing and smooth. And, yes, I brought a glass for the tailgate. Veteran move.",4.42
Haze,"Impressive dome head which never recedes completely. Excellent lacing with a variety of streaks and spots. The liquid is cloudy with a dirty gold appearance.

Grapefruit rind aroma along with some green vegetal/fresh cut grass notes. The malt is hard to tease out, but I would say it's closest to light wheat bread.

There's a berry sweetness up front. Richer body with a neutral level of carbonation. The hop is pronounced but not overwhelming. It's closer to black pepper with a notable alcohol warmth in the swallow. The sweetness returns in the aftertaste, but dissipates first leaving the peppery finish.",4.27
Haze,"So maybe I made mistake of having very hazy first, but this one, while good, is so much like hundreds of other neipa's I have had. Murky darker yellow hazy body with a huge white head, spotted lacing. Big grapefruit and citrus with light pineapple lead the nose. Taste is much the same, some tangerine additions are nice. Body is medium-light with decent brightness and smoothness, not the most lush neipa ever. Does hide the abv very well",4.21
Haze,"Pours a fairly light straw color, perfect foamy white head. Aroma is citrusy, grassy, earthy, slightly dank. Flavor is sharp citrus, lemon candy, spicy grapefruit pith. Creamy texture with ample bitterness throughout and a pretty dry finish. Overall a tasty brew, but there are a lot of other TH ipa’s that I prefer.

S - Aroma is mango, peach and papaya.

Doppelganger,"Poured on 5/7/2022 from a 16oz can that was purchased at the brewery on 4/29/2022 into a tulip glass.

A: The beer is a very hazy dark gold color, with a large white head that fades quickly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.

S: The aroma contains strong juicy citrus and tropical fruits, floral and dank hops and light caramelized malts.

T: The taste likewise starts out with strong sweet and juicy flavors of citrus and tropical fruits. Then a strong but not over-powering floral and dank hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.

M: Very crisp and very smooth, light-to-medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.

O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, well-disguised kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2NEIPA to drink for a very long time.",4.66
Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy orange yellow color with a medium bodied but sticky white colored head that laces the glass on the way down. Smells of a treehouse - sweet toasted malts and then citrus and floral hop aromas to finish off the nose. The taste is sweet toasted malts, and then floral and hops finish off with a grapefruit taste. It's smooth, real silky, medium bodied, perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, good beer.",4.25
Doppelganger,Pours more like a west coast IPA with a dank nose. Surprising mild flavor with super smooth finish. This is really a nice beer and super juicy. Very good.,4.63
Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy dirty straw color with over a finger of head. The nose is predominantly dank with some piney notes in the background. The flavor has notes of orange juice and grapefruit juice with a pithiness on the finish.

This offering is super juicy but while the finish is hoppy, it simply lacks the bitterness that I expect in a top-shelf DIPA. It's tasty, interesting and worth trying once but I wouldn't make it a repeat purchase.",4.22
Doppelganger,"Pours a hazy medium straw color, abundant foamy head that lasts. Huge hoppy aroma, loads of overripe mango, massive pineapple, dank guava. Some citrus as well. Remarkable. Very flavorful. Loads of ripe tropical fruits mix with pithy citrus notes. Very juicy, semi sweet with no bitterness. Good carbonation. Overall an excellent DIPA. Would buy again.

Doppelganger,"Canned 2/15/21, ""I have read a book about me reading the book I am reading"" stamped on the bottom

This beer is an imperial version of Alter Ego, which is one of their only flagship NEIPAs that I have not tried yet, so I can't draw any comparisons there. However, I have had Doubleganger, the extra hopped variant of this and enjoyed it quite a bit

Pours a hazy pale yellow with 3 fingers of rocky white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

There is a perfect blend of tropical fruit and dank herbal hops in the nose, quite unlike any beer of theirs or any IPA really, almost an earthy perfume vibe that oddly reminds me of the smell of a church. I'm picking up on aromas of orange juice, creamy peach, juicy papaya, pithy grapefruit, grassy hops, dank herbs, a bit of onion, and doughy malt to hold it all together

Herbaceous vibes from the nose translate well into taste but with less intensity, allowing for greater balance which bumps up my rating. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy papaya, mango, overripe grapefruit, light pine, and a creamy malt. The swallow brings notes of herbal hops, creamy malt, tangerine, and underripe cantaloupe

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a very creamy beer that coats the mouth on the way down. Finishes somewhere between dry and slick

This one was interesting for sure. Way more herbs than I usually get in a TH beer, and for uniqueness alone I have to bump up the overall score. Really good stuff here!",4.4
Doppelganger,"A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with 2 fingers of head that fades down to a decent cap that leaves good lacing

S: A mix of tropical fruit and citrus up front along with a dose of dank and earthy undertones

T: Follows the nose. Starts off with the tropical fruit and citrus, quickly followed up by the dank, herbal, and earthy tones. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with lingering tropical fruit and citrus

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth

O: A very good imperial version of Alter Ego that really hits with both the juicy and dank notes. Very easy to drink. Definitely worth checking out",4.58
Doppelganger,"Pours hazy straw yellow, two fingers of head that recedes slowly with lots of lacing.

Nose is tropical citrus, lemon, mango, pineapple.

Taste follows, lemon, mango, some notes of pine/resin.

Feel is excellent, slightly creamy full bodied, good carbonation, leaves a slight sticky lingering feeling.

Overall excellent hazy IPA from Treehouse as usual",3.98
I Let My Tape Rock,Had in 2018 was probably my favorite J. Wakefield to date. Great collaboration of flavors and enjoyed this a lot. Thought feel could have been a little better.,4.69
I Let My Tape Rock,"2020 Bottle thanks to Eziel

L: Pours jet black with minimal tan head

S: Coconut... lots of coconut, a bit of maple and vanilla

T: Coconut and more coconut, don't get a lot of the vanilla or the coffee

F: Heavy AF on the mouthfeel, no sharpness from the carb (minimal)

O: This is a very good beer, the look and smell are top notch. I wish it had some more carb overall and I could get a bit more coffee.",4.61
I Let My Tape Rock,"L: Dark mahogany viscous pour with a sandy head and slight lacing
S: Tons of maple and vanilla on the nose
T: Robust maple slightly reigned in by the coffee, but the sweetness is magnified by a creamy vanilla caviar
F: Thick and chewy - very nice
O: Just another stand out Big Poppa variant - decadent and rich. The maple is an incredible complement. Well done.",4.84
I Let My Tape Rock,"Viscous almost gloppy black out of the bottle, it forms a thin dark tan film that quickly settles to a thin chain.

Significant barrel spice and heat are right up front before the thick body envelopes the palate with maple, coconut, and mocha brownies. The finish actually cleans up and even becomes somewhat crisp to a semi-dry, tingly and only slightly sticky lip smacking swallow.

The barrel is significant here. Mature, spicy, peppery, and lightly charred with a caramel and even spiced rum character to it. This compliments the maple well, while tempering the decadence of the mocha, vanilla and coconut, which is like a swirling creme anglaise throughout.",4.31
Swish,"Swish, canned 06/09/22, pours an orange, pineapple juice color with a big head and an absolutely fabulous aroma of the hops. Taste follows the nose and the taste is all hops and it's a splendid blend. The mouthfeel is very smooth, delicious and lacks bitterness. Overall one of the best juice bombs I ever had the pleasure to consume. Special Thanks to Jennifer for sharing this fantastic New England IPA.",4.78
Swish,"Hazy. Fruity. Smooth. Like a bunch of tropical fruits blended and fermented.

Only issue? Maybe fermented a bit too long. Bit of an alcohol burn. Not overpowering, but there compared to some of the others on draft. Tasty, smooth enough, but my table enjoyed Here’s To Feeling Good All The Time much more, that was a damn near perfect beer.",3.83
Swish,"Had on tap. Hazy darker yellow with a full white head and light lacing. Big citrus and bright tropical fruit juices with dank hops for the aroma bouquet. Taste adds a shot of honey, instead of general citrus and tropical juice, now here I get defined orange, lemon, pineapple, lychee, papaya, big peach, and grapefruit. Super juicy and refreshing feel, medium bodied and bright with a wet softness.",4.44
Swish,"An outstanding hazy NEIPA.

Appearance is light yellow, opaque, light head.

Smell is strong grapefruit, citrus, lemon, orange. Maybe just a very slight touch of dank?

Feel is a touch light, but that adds to the drinkability without being too heavy. Nice effervescence.

Taste follows the smell, forward and strong grapefruit dominates, undertones of citrus, lemon, orange. Very delicious, very drinkable. Nicely balanced without being a ‘juice bomb’ or cloyingly dank.

Overall one of (if not the overall) the best hazy NEIPA’s. You could have several of these in a row.",4.65
Swish,"Typical NE hazy yellow IPA with an orange tinge and a nice cream head.
Tropical nose of papaya, melon and pineapple with a racy grapefruit citrus note running through.
Palate follows nose very closely and the hops are nicely integrated rather than overpowering and dominating.
A really great beer.",4.77
Swish,"Pours a bright orange-yellow color. Completely opaque, somewhat thickish. Lovely three finger head forms on the beer, lingers, and then dissipates leaving a thin layer of residual foam on top of the beer. Aroma has notes of bright citrus, papaya, pineapple, with some light dank hoppy notes. Its really nice - balance of sweetness, fruit but with some bitterness.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange rind, mango, papaya and peach - sweet but not overly so. A nice bitterness on the back end cuts that sweetness down and balances it out a bit. There are some light straw notes and a certain grassiness to the beer. Feel is medium bodied, moderate carbonation, somewhat drier finish.

Overall its a lovely NE style IPA and definitely worthy of the high ranking here. Its not often these days that a NE style IPA impresses me, but this one did.",4.46
The Broken Truck,"Appearance - The beer, from a double sealed bottle, poured a golden color with an aggressively bubbled white head.

Smell - The brett character came out in the nose with a degree of bitterness.

Taste - Grass, green apples, and a brett character that really stands out. The finish had a bitter earthy quality. It was not particularly sour, but it definitely brought the funk.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was aggressive, quickly sweeping away any sweetness.

Overall - No fruits or adjuncts are needed. This was great.",4.56

The Broken Truck,Solid beer - great balance to everything. Also great color to this beer and amazing offering. Looks like straw and has a dankness. Tastes like Belgium from Oregon.,4.6
The Broken Truck,"It poured a hazy peach color with a foamy white head. The nose is earthy, musty and very floral with notes of lemon and melon. The taste is surprisingly bitter with heavy notes of grapefruit pith. Minimally sour but still has that lambic funk with a cider quality and mild lactic acidity. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Its actually not harsh on the palate, quite easy to drink.

Overall: its a great beer. Not as complex as I expected, but its simplicity is not a bad thing. Its quite similar to to FFG Last Four Winters in Wisconsin and New Glarus Vintage series. It would be fun to have them all side by side.",4.29

Nose: 4 - smells just like The Lily. White wine. EXTREMELY funky.

Taste: 4 - weird, it's actually kind of bitter. It's very sout, but it's got this vinegary quality to it. Good, but not amazing. Like a fine gueuze.

Mouth: 5 - bubbles galore. Impressive how it doesn't feel overly carbonated despite the bubbles.

Overall: 4 - tasty, well made, but odd.

Cheers!",4.16
The Broken Truck,"Really awesome and complex offering from De Garde. As a member, this beer is one of the ones I most look forward to each and every year. Absolutely worth seeking out.",4.54
The Broken Truck,"Bottle, blend 3, purchased at The Tin Bucket.

A clear copper with a dense, white head with good retention and minimal lacing, this looks solid. The nose is pretty excellent. Insanely funky with preserved lemon, earth, mushroom, petrichor, light honey, floral orange blossoms, grapefruit pith. The dry, dusty, mineraly funk is just awesome. Dried mushroom for days. Delicate elderflower funk notes are present.

The palate opens tart and lactic, a blend of earthy and mushroomy funk, complementing the sourness quite well. The sourness is reserved, not only for the style, but also given the age and the fact that this is an older de Garde. Remarkably well balanced, there are undercurrents of peach and pear. The funk on the palate is just fantastic, with layers of earth, leather, mushroom, cobwebs and must, and yes, some horseblanket as well. Drying, tart on the finish with a moderate carbonation, flavors of earth and mushroom linger. Highly recommended, especially for fans of the funk. Truly old world like.",4.56
Triple Shot,"Canned 2/2022. I'm pleasantly surprised by how sweet this isn't, just a hint of rich semi-sweet chocolate at finish. The nutty, roasty base makes for a wonderful coffee showcase throughout.",4.43
Triple Shot,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with an inch of tan head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh roasted coffee with roasted bean notes and chocolate in the profile.

Taste - Overall, this was like espresso with a huge body. There were notes of fresh roasted coffee, fudge, chocolate ice cream, and just a hint of vanilla. The sweetness came out more in the finish. In the big picture, it was an assault of espresso.

Mouthfeel - The beer had a nice thick clingy body. It allowed the bitterness to linger.

Overall - This was a really nice stout with a lot of coffee. Finding a more intense coffee stout would be a challenge.",4.53
Triple Shot,"Nice dark black color with outstanding brown foam and lacing. Smell is nothing to write home about—water, slight roasted malts and a faint sweet coffee.but it tastes fantastic: deep coffee tones permeate throughout and a sweet molasses cover a base of toasty malt stout. Cheers.",4.38
Triple Shot,"House Blend, consumed 6/12/21
Pours incredibly thick for a non-BA stout, great feel. Sweet with a Big Chocolatey roasted coffee smell and taste. Definitely a “dessert” beer, and one that’s meant to be shared. Definitely a treat though, and probably one of the best non-BA stout I’ve had.",4.47
Medianoche - Coconut,"Bless my friends at Tavour for delivering this to my door (eventually). Imbibed a few samples at a local beer festival this spring & happy to finally have it from a bottle on my comfortable couch. Split with my stout-guzzling wife.

Black. After a brief, wispy, half-bald head rises on the pour, it’s 100% gone two minutes later, looking still & sinister. A beer to drown your enemies in (but what a waste…maybe drown your friends?). The nose is coconut & endless malts.

Medianoche – Coconut is thicker than my Sunday waffle batter. Borderline gummy chewable. Taste-wise it’s a simpler beer than I expected. I scoffed at the ‘brownie batter’ description but it’s on the mark & right up front. Well, batter with a shot of bourbon mixed in right after the eggs. Extended cut of coconut, pinch of brown sugar, serious malty sweetness throughout. Given a 10:30 AM wakeup time & a couple hours I’d love to take one of these solo.

Just what I expect from this line of stouts. Thick, sweet, heavy barrel, delicious. Excellent beer.",4.3
Medianoche - Coconut,"Thick and viscous like oil; impenetrable black body; no head but a bit of percolating carbonation; flat; sediment flecks tread along the top of the beer. Rich aroma; dark chocolate and roasted coffee; coconut. Enormous flavors of milk chocolate, fudge; coconut and bourbon; faint maraschino cherry and peppermint suggestion; subliminal earthy spiciness in the background. Dense, sludgy mouthfeel; heavy slipperiness; incredible residual sugar presence; syrupy; low-level alcohol warmth in the background.

What hath these brewer's created? Sure, a rather dark and dull appearance but the smell characteristics pick things up. Then, you come to the taste and mouthfeel. Jumpin' Jesus on a pogo stick! What an awe-inspiring experience. The depth, richness and complexity are nearly out of this world. A beer one needs to experience to fully appreciate what mere words struggle to convey.

Pouring temperature: 61.7% ℉; bottling data: 2022 release",4.65
Medianoche - Coconut,"2022 version poured from a 500ML bottle into a snifter. Pours very dark resembling motor oil. Very thick, which I enjoy. Solid coconut flavor that isn't over the top sweet but drinking more than a 500ml bottle would be a challenge.",4.56
Medianoche - Coconut,"500ml bottle from Tavour. Slow, thick pour, black as midnight, no head at all.
Aroma features light boozy notes, chocolate and heaps of coconut. Taste is sweet, chocolate and coconut, thick and syrupy. Luscious, sumptuous.",4.51
Medianoche - Coconut,"No vintage or ABV info on the bottle, but this is the aged Blanton's barrels for 21-24 months version. This looks and feels like stout gravy, I mean this is gelatinous. I can't quite decide if this is too much of a good thing or not. Does anyone else wonder if brewers add corn starch to some of these thicker beers? Weirdly, what few bubbles I could coax from a vigorous pour seemed to exist under the surface.

This is massively, absurdly flavorful. I can't pick all that much out of this, just heaps of bittersweet chocolate and coconut for the most part. I do get a little bourbon but no barrel character otherwise. Very enjoyable.

Edit, there was a weird 2 in long lump at the bottom of my glass. Gross, lowering some scores.",4.11
Medianoche - Coconut,"2021 version aged in Blanton’s. Crazy thickness just sticks to the glass. Anchorage Blessed thick. Shiny film on top let’s you know there’s a bunch of fresh coconut. Nose is heavy dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, coconut. First sips are a shot of motor oil with all those flavors. The Blanton’s brings a darkness to the already heavy malt stout. There’s a tiny hint of bourbon bite, but cut by the coconut sweetness. Definitely a sipper with this viscosity. No noticeable carbonation, just still black goodness. Fortunate to have gotten this by Tavour.

Honestly, Thin Man’s Recent Blanton’s BA Coconut Jenkins gives this a run for its money. Their’s is a little brighter, a little less viscous, but on par IMO.",4.98
Medianoche - Coconut,"This is a special beer.

Pours deep, deep black and very oily thick with absolutely no carbonation and no head whatsoever. At the end of my pour, a thin sheen of copper colored beer glistened on the top. The smell is incredible -- the bourbon barrel comes through strongly with notes of chocolate, cinnamon and coconut. The taste is rich, deeply, deeply chocolate with cinnamon, vanilla notes and coconut as well. There is a strong resemblence to brownies laced with alcohol as well as to a rich creme brulee. A noteworthy taste extravaganza.",4.82
Medianoche - Coconut,"The coffee-coconut was one of my beers of the year last year, from that point onward wanted to try this one. Viscous black body with a short lived brown cap. Nose is laced with bourbon backed dark chocolate with coconut, vanilla, brownie batter, with undercurrents of molasses, roasted malt, oak, and a kiss of cinnamon. Taste is much the same with the huge chocolate, bourbon, coconut and gourmet vanilla, but I find the coffee not being there to cut the sweetness over time hurts this one. This is especially true in the feel, where the heavy, thick, boozy, and massive mouthfeel doesn't do anything to stop sweetness from building. Still a great stout, but the sweetness does add up over time, share the bottle",4.4
Medianoche - Coconut,"Look - black thick syrup with fantastic lacing, no real head or rimming though
Smell - sweet coconut chocolate and booze

Medianoche - Coconut,"2022 bottle. Pours mega thick. Completely opaque. Cannot see through it at all. Very minimal mocha head. Aroma is milk chocolate and subtle coconut. Flavor is same as aroma…huge milk chocolate and more coconut in the finish. Sweet but not overbearing. Mouthfeel is insane. This coats everything. Mouth and glass coating. Insanely thick. Overall, a treat to drink. Was a bit much to solo the bottle. Better to share.",4.66

O---An excellent one. If I knew how good it is, I would've bought more than one.",4.17
Sip Of Sunshine,"This is a marvelous DIPA!!!! As good as any I have tried. Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass this beer featured a medium sized bubbly white head that fades pretty quickly and plenty of lacing on the glass. Beautiful, almost clear, orange/light copper color. Aroma and taste are wonderful. Like Heady Topper, the aroma bursts out the second you open the can - mostly floral hops and some tropical fruit. The taste features floral hops as well but there is more piney hops than the nose would indicate. There is some balance with rye or sourdough bready malt but hops rule here. There is a strong and welcome bitterness to this beer - more complex than a simple hop bomb - but bitter enough to satisfy any hophead. Mouthfeel is bitter, crisp and features a richness associated with the malt. Easily one of the best beers I have ever experienced.",4.57

Sip Of Sunshine,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours a gorgeous transparent orange with plenty of white head. Tons of lacing after the head recedes. Tiny bubbles throughout the glass that persist. Looks fantastic!

The nose is incredible. Oranges, apple pie, mango, pineapple, grass, a touch of honey, and a really nice hoppy layer at the end. This is definitely a wonderful tropical fruit nose. Juicy.

The taste nicely follows the nose. Tropical fruit is definitely there on impact, but nothing like the nose. The middle region and aftertaste are clearly bitter hops. Dank. Citrus peel. Leather, sourdough bread, and a strong earthy note.

Mouthfeel is dry and crisp. Love it.",4.31
Sip Of Sunshine,"Rich, golden amber body; nice carbonation; thick head, dense, white, semi-creamy. Enticing aroma; soft earthy, fruity sweetness; orange and mango; light malt presence in the background.

Pours a hazy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

This is super juicy in the nose, but also shows and incredible balance. I’m picking up on aromas of orange zest, bready malt, mango juice, peppery hops, pithy grapefruit, cantaloupe, pineapple juice, and light weed

While it’s very good in taste, it doesn’t carry that same balance displayed in the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting overripe mango, orange zest, doughy malt, lemon zest, grassy hops, and light pineapple. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, bready malt, caramel, pineapple juice, grapefruit zest, peppery hops, and light weed

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy yet crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with with a nice blend of fruit juice and weed

Well, the taste may have been a bit of a letdown, but overall this is a killer beer. I can’t wait to try more from The Alchemist",4.46
Focal Banger,"Would argue that this is in fact better than Heady Topper. The tropical nature and just dankness of the hops shines through even more. Where Heady Topper feels like I’m drinking hop resin, Focal Banger feels like I’m drinking fruit juice with a tinge of hops.",4.96
Focal Banger,"Look: Pale yellow and cloudy with a quick-forming head that settles to a lid and holds, leaving nice ripples of lacing clinging to the edges of the glass
Aroma: Blueberries, mango, grapefruit, passionfruit, pine needles, peach, mandarins, raspberries, sweet bready malt, and some Cannabis
Taste: The palate assault begins with pithy citrus, pine sap, and ripe blueberries that immediately expand their breadth and depth. Soon after, Cannabis, tropical fruit, orange-led citrus, and raspberries start to catch up and mix with the initial hop notes and all happening upon a soft, sweet malt base. Slick hop oils and alpha acids come in waves throughout and closes with a bold bite, pine, and dank
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, medium-high carbonation, and medium strength dryness on the finish
Overall: This is a phenomenal beer. Having had this gem and it’s bigger, bolder cousin (Heady) both for the first time in the last week, I can say not only have I been blown away by both, but I would immediately be a convert to the NE-Style/hazy IPA if all of them were like this O.G. Such a great and almost unbelievably deep nose along with tons of flavor depth, some slickness, a bold bite, and dryness are all prominent here and everything I feel many iterations lack more often than not. I now understand the hype of this sub-style where it originated as well as realizing how many times that I’ve heard how good this beer is and now can finally say, I wholeheartedly agree",4.55
Focal Banger,"My buddy bought me a four pack each of HT And Focal Banger. This was by far my favorite.

Pours a murky gold color with a beautiful fluffy white marshmallow head. Tremendous lacing.

The aroma is pure hop goodness. The flavor and taste on this one is out of this world outstanding. Peach and pine and grapefruit with no sweetness. A true west coast IPA.

Outside of Pliny this is my fave IPA in the world. Fantastic! Thanks Harris!!",4.84
Focal Banger,"16oz can

Pours three massive fingers of supremely fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is superb, after a few minutes all of the head is still here. Initial lacing looks great. Body is a cloudy yellow, reminiscent of a Witbier. Looks perfect so far.

Nose is soft tropical fruit, mandarin oranges, small dankness. There is a perceived sweetness, likely from the fruit. This smells good, elegant, I hope the fruit isn't too candi-like.

The dankness and fruit balance each other wonderfully on the flavor, with neither being overwhelming. Fruit is mostly soft - mandarin oranges, finishes with a citrus rind bite.

Carbonation is medium-low, a small hop bite adds some character. Body drinks relatively light, which is a welcome characteristic. Bitterness is medium-low. Sweetness mostly comes from the fruit, and isn't cloying. Overall a pretty classic mouthfeel for a classic hazy.

Drinkability is pretty high. It's not cloying, or too bitter.

Appearance turned out wonderful. Lacing was thick all the way down, and a small island of foam remained till the end.

Overall a solid classic. Balanced and flavorful.",4.28

The Alchemist
New England IPA
ABV: 7%
Date: 05/03/2022
I was given this beer by one of my good friends. I have already consumed a few; they are tasty. Served in a tulip glass at around 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head with above-average retention. The head is bright white, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color is pale straw with hues of light gold, charting beer around SRM 4. This beer is hazy, and little yeasty friends are just floating around. The appearance of the beer is above average.
Tangerines, lightly floral, with hints of pineapple, pears, and peaches, are the hops aromas. The malt profile is lightly toasted bread crust, cereal grains, and a touch of crackers. Other aromas are grass, wet dew, and yeasty.
The hop profile is the star of this beer. The hops flavors I taste are tangerine, a hint of pine, a touch of orange peel, pineapple, mango, pears, some floral, and a touch of passionfruit. The malt body is light yet stiff enough to hold the hops in check. Other flavors I detect are lightly toasted bread crust, crackers, a hint of minerals, a touch phenolic, and grassy.
The mouthfeel is dry and crisp with medium carbonation. The body is medium, and it finishes tannic and long.
An amazing beer! When I drink NEIPA, this is the standard which I hold other beer. Now I am talking about the balance, flavor profile, and a deft hand in creating this work of art. I wished I lived closer to this brewery, I would have a constant stock of their beer in my fridge.",4.75
Focal Banger,"Heady Topper's little brother!!! Less alcohol presence but just as impressive!!! Poured from a 16 oz. can into a pint glass (I know what it says on the can, but I like looking at my beer!!!) , this beer features a very pale yellow hazy color with a good size foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Head retention is good. Aroma and taste remind me of Heady Topper in that the aroma cascade out of the can as soon as you open it!!! Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose and taste. More pronounced ""dankness"" than Heady Topper and I detected kind of a mild tobacco taste that I did not detect in Heady Topper. Mouthfeel is rich, bitter and crisp. A great beer!!!!",4.34
Focal Banger,"Just like the OG Heady Topper, this one is a banger. NE IPA without being overly sweet. Resinous, hoppy, slightly dank. Great beer. Have to buy it every time it makes its way to my local store.",4.43
Focal Banger,"Look: nice can art :)

Smell: mostly stuck in the can

Taste: a little creamy, a little piney, a little grapefruit, good balance.

Feel: Not as ""plush"" as some more recent beers, but not thin either. Just right for the taste.

Overall: I'm not as blown away as some but it is still very, very good. Might be even better if this one was a little less cold.",4.5
Focal Banger,"Refrigerated Focal Banger 1/2 quart can poured into shell glass. Very much like Heady Topper, but with a shade less alcohol. Nice intense hop flavor and aroma, with some bitterness. I would prefer more malt body, though.",3.89
Focal Banger,"Slightly opaque, straw yellow with a low white head of fine bubbles. Aroma of citrusy hops and a bit of pine. Hoppy flavors upfront, a bit hard-edged but that’s meant in a good way. Flavors of tangerine and grapefruit pith, pine and apricot. Medium mouthfeel, finishes a little tingly, warming up the sides of the cheeks. Hop bitters linger. Is it heresy to say I like it better than HT?",4.36
Focal Banger,"Has a nice floral, fruity aroma & hop dankness scent. Taste like a bit of melon & pineapple juice but the hop aftertaste is fantastic as it really lingers. This is a really great IPA that I will get again when I get back to Vermont. Cheers to The Alchemist!",4.91
Focal Banger,"Pours an opaque, orange color. Thick, three finger frothy head forms on the beer, lingers a moment, then dissipates leaving just a thin residual head behind. White lacing coats the glass. Aroma has notes of dank weed, some catty notes, woody hops and a lighter layer of citrus, orange, and mango.

Taste follows the nose with notes of weedy hops, dank notes, wood, and some light orange and citrus notes. There is a noticeable malt backbone to the beer. Feel is light, smooth and oddly refreshing in a way.

Overall it is a nice IPA. I think I am somewhat less blown away by it than most, but it is still a very nice IPA.",4.25
Citra,"16 ounce can into plastic hotel room cup at Tustin Inn. Canned on 3/17/22. Pours slightly hazy golden amber color with a 1 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with some streaming carbonation. Aromas and flavors of huge passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, blueberry, tangerine, red grapefruit, citrus peel/rind, wood, mint, peppercorn, pine, cracker, bread dough, light honey/toast, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good sized pine, citrus peel/rind, herbal, woody, grassy, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body. Balanced creamy/grainy malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long resinous drying finish with mild astringency. Mild increasing warmth of 8.5%, a bit of hop burn. Super juicy, dank, and earthy hops; with a good sized malt backbone. Top tier west coast style, aggressive yet smooth.",4.35
Citra,"Poured a golden amber color with a nice 1 inch head that left some lacing. Taste is exactly what I hoped for—loads of delicious, dank citra! Mouthfeel is nice; has some rich gravity to it. I’m highly considering buying some more of this—very nice, delicious brew. Very strong on the citra hops and leans on the west coast IPA side, thankfully.",4.94
Citra,"Appearance - The beer poured a rusty yellow color with a visible carbonation and a white head.

Smell - Citrus came though in the nose with a little bit of sweetness.

Taste - With a full body, the citra hops needed to be bold. In fact, they were bold. Unlike most citra hopped beers, this one leaned more bitter. It was dank, with notes of guava and lemon. The finish was warm and a bit of spice.

Mouthfeel - This was not a light beer. It had serious viscosity for the style with notable carbonation.

Overall - Citra hops went in a bit different direction in this beer. I liked it.",4.44
Citra,"Sweet tropical hoppy, slightly malty, and hint of piney, citrus nose on this one! Taste follows with a balanced, old-school hoppy, slightly malty, and piney citrus bitter finish. This was a little more malt dominant than I was expecting, but still good!",4.18
Citra,"Gold steering toward brown, white foam.

Face full of citra hops.

Not the east coast fruit bomb, this has a domineering earthy bent. Something close to cumin with more than notes of tangy pineapple and, much more so on the finish, orange.

Dry-ish and sharp-ish, sorta crackery. Notably softer when poured.",4.29
Citra,"Canned on 11/11/21; consumed on 11/19/21

Pours a foggy, bronze-tinted, rusty orange body capped with multiple fingers of dense, fluffy, white foam; good head retention leaves a finger of rich, creamy cap, equally rich collar lining the surface, and thick layers of webby lacing and spotty accessories spread across the entirety of the glass.

Aroma features flaky malts introducing a softer pineapple into mango flesh and a resinous grapefruit interlude sparking a peaking bouquet, whereon transitional pine to fresh-cut grass on the back end remains synchronized to a peppery dank, lemon twist.

Taste opens to pineapple resins with a light tinge of tangerine pith, wrapped in an undertone of freshly sliced mango laden with grassy hop textures; a grapefruit twang over the mid-palate phases effortlessly into a lemony dank finish with flaky malt accents and distant hints of pine.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; a wispy twang invigorates a vague bitterness over the mid-palate, trending sticky as pillowy resins take hold into the back end for a lush hop consistency, and a flaky crispness persists with drying undertones through the finish.

Levels of resinous saturation bridge West Coast and New England IPA elements, bringing into focus advanced tropical fruit development born from an ultra-refined and raw hop core, and a deftly established malt profile; this is a measured intensity, and a deceptively potent variation of the WCIPA.",4.4
Citra,"2021 Vintage

Appearance: Slightly cloudy amber-yellow color with a fairly generous generous-sized thick, foamy white head that slowly faded. A nice looking IIPA for my tastes.

Smell: Citrus, tropical fruit aromas and moderate pine aromas. Nothing to fault with the nose.

Taste: Moderately tart grapefruit/citrus notes, moderate tropical fruit notes and mild pine notes. Some mild bready notes from the malts to counter all the hop notes. The beer has a strong hop backbone that provides a fairly dry finish that lets the fruity notes die off gradually.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a generous level of carbonation. The mouthfeel is spot on for an IIPA.

Overall: A great IIPA. A very good hop flavor profile with enough of a malt backbone to produce a good flavor profile. i wish I had a time machine so that I could decide if OG Nelson or Citra was/is my favorite IPA/IIPA.",4.44
Citra,"Canned on 3/22, freshest I've had by some margin!
L: Eschews classic West Coast IPA visual with a slightly more opaque and deeper color than other classics of the style. Beautiful lacing on glass after some sips, yet head dissipates rather quickly. This has little bearing on the beer overall personally, a minor complaint.
S: Lovely nose of tropical notes. Smells of fruit and citrus, not an overpoweringly strong scent yet clearly expresses the flavor profile to expect.
T: Citrus and fruit flavor explodes here. Measured bitterness reminds that this is a West Coast IPA, yet has a juiciness that has come to be associated with NEIPAs nowadays. Hoppy and fruity, taste follows suit on the nose and then some.
F: Perfectly measured medium body, finishes on the dry side yet the tropical fruit and citrus notes linger for some time.
O: My third experience with Citra, I think I can conclude that this is my favorite West Coast IPA of them all. The juicier and sweeter characteristics of it as opposed to other notable examples of the style put it over the edge as a truly original and exciting beer. Drank fresh, it is an absolute revelation in a time where the IPA market is oversaturated and often difficult to get excited about. Seek it out!",4.86
Citra,"Points off on looks only because the head is fairly scrawny; much less than a finger in my pint glas;. nice lacing though. I have a lousy nose but as soon as I opened the can I could smell fruity goodness with citrus dominating. The taste is so well balanced, with a good amount of juicy +hoppy. Citrus flavors dominate but certainly only part of a really well balanced flavor profile. I really like this one a lot. More, please.",4.74
Citra,"Pours a beautiful glowing copper, clear and clean. The aroma isn’t as big and vibrant as I might expect, but more subdued and muted. It’s bursting with flavor, all that citra goodness, with just enough heft and body on the back. I thought it was fantastic.",4.46
West Ashley,"SARA does great with all their Saisons. However, I expected the apricot to pop out a bit more than it did. I enjoyed this beer very much but felt like the hype perhaps made me have higher expectations. I’m very interested to try again and taste other vintages as well.",4.0
West Ashley,"Most recent batch. Thanks, Sam!

A clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing this looks great. The nose is super ripe, fruity, floral apricots with a lactic saison adjacent base. Delicately floral fruit notes, probably from the Pinot Noir casks, is present, though this doesn't have a real red wine character. Vanilla to go with ripe apricots. Awesome. The fruit expression is sublime.

The palate opens with a blend of lactic tartness, mildly yogurt like with lots of fresh apricots. Just tons of it, though in a nuanced, delicate way rather than the unabashed abandon that's Fou'Foune. No real funk here, this is fruit and acidity in perfect harmony. Vanillin, delicately fruity Pinot Noir, a nice tannin character are all present. Drying, lactic, fruity on the finish with lots of lingering apricots. Tannins and a little grain round out the finish. SARA beers aspire for a higher ideal in the mouthfeel category, and this beer delivers. Light, airy, parfait-like with tons of fine carbonation, just enough to lift the fruit heavy beer but not so much that it's anywhere close to being foamy. Gentle, coaxing, prodding, this is a truly excellent beer.

In contrast to the fresh Fantasia I had a couple of nights back- this has more fruit, more sourness but less funk and less depth outside the fruit. They are both equally good interpretations of the style, and I can see my preference flip flopping.",4.59
West Ashley,"Appearance - The beer poured a golden orange color with high carbonation and a white head.

Smell - The beer smelled like fresh sweet apricots and light barnyard funk.

Taste - What strikes me about this beer is how well the apricots and saison funk work together. At the front, the fruit was sweet and fresh before turning funky in the finish. The finish was tart, but not overwhelming.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was high, erupting from the newly opened bottle. The dry finish had nice lingering power.

Overall - What a well-crated saison!",4.58
West Ashley,"One of my favorites of all time of any style.
Roll the bottle around before opening to get a little bit of cloud from the yeast on the bottom, if that's your thing.
Smells like lemon, sour cherries, peachy.
Tastes just like the smell. Dry, smells sweeter than it tastes. Hint of funk.
West Ashley used to taste a lot more tart, but just tastes like sweet nectar now after having it so many times.",4.87
West Ashley,"Orange citrus with peaches, this is so easy to drink its no wonder it is in a 750ml bottle. Sante focuses on this funk that their beers offer that I have not tasted in many other breweries that are also known for their ales and saisons, and this was no slacker. A very mellow orange taste is felt at the start but soon the strong peach taste in this one that will blow your mind, the tartness you would expect is minimal if any as the peaches are sweet enough to make your tastebuds focus on that.",4.56
Ephraim,"Canned on 5/25/22; consumed on 6/14/22

Pours a hazy, largely translucent dark orange body topped with two fingers of fluffy, slightly off-white foam; good head retention leaves a half-finger of cap, a slim, frothy collar, and myriad spattering of webby/spotty lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma highlights dank orange oils and accents of sunflower petals/general florality upfront, leaving crackery malt lingering into soft, grassy resins glossing over soft lemon peel over time.

Taste features waxy peach zest within a resinous overlay as grapefruit steadily washes over a catty/peppery undertone; light moss and wilted mint over the mid-palate fade to residual pine past the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body and a choppy fluff of moderate carbonation, dispersing dry textures and a pseudo-bittering over the mid-palate before eventually fading to a flaky crispness; a resinous glide brightens over the back end as bits of residual grit prickle the finish.

A warming aggression peeks through the stability of crackery malt and floral resins, an unforeseen grit waving across the normally clean Hill IPA profile; the subtle bittering and choppier tones of earth the result ultimately lend to a slightly more varied and intense profile to contrast the largely delicate base.",4.25

Ephraim,"This one pours a somewhat hazy golden yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like intensely resinous piney hops, grapefruit rind, booze, pineapple, and grapefruit.

This is definitely a bruiser, and easily the booziest HF IPA I've had, which makes a lot of sense. It's quite resinous and bitter, with lots of pine and earthiness. There is a lot of juicy and citrusy type things, too, as I get grapefruit, melon, pineapple, and some lemon. There's not too much malt character, but it does finish a touch boozy.

This is medium bodied, with an intense lingering bitterness, both from the hops and higher alchohol. Despite that, it's still pretty drinkable for me.

Alright, time for the highest rated American Strong Ale, which is quite the ambiguous style, but I’m excited regardless. Especially after having The Rusty Nail and knowing they excel at using cinnamon as an adjunct, I can’t wait to try this. Let’s get into it

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is super cinnamon forward in the nose, almost too much but it’s still nice. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, spicy whiskey, and toasted oak

It’s a bit more balanced in taste, and very good, but I was expecting this to pop more. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, toasted oak, earthy cinnamon, raisin, earthy whiskey, brown sugar, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, sweetened coffee, milk chocolate, toasted oak, caramel, and bourbon. Gets better as it warms but I wanted more complexity out if it

A medium full body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a lush yet zippy beer. Finishes dry for everything going on and drinks well below the 13% listed

Given the fact that it improves over the course of drinking it, I have to bump this one up a bit in the overall. Still not everything I was hoping for but very good",4.31
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2017 limited release Coffee Cinnamon Barrel Aged B-Bomb, imperial winter ale. Aged (4 years? or nearly 5?) in my cellar and served chilled in a Chimay chalice. Oil slick appearance and a big warm cinnamon nose that fills the room. Really that aroma is hard to beat. Flavor is creamy and mouth-encompassing with waves of caramel, cinnamon candy. Ultra-fine carbonation adds milkiness to the mouthfeel. Mocha and coffee flavors are initially mellowed but there's a more pronounced coffee bitterness in the aftertaste. Vanilla flavors from the bourbon are also mellow, and I don't get any harsh whisky flavor at all. Pretty amazing for 13.0% ABV. World-Class absolutely describes it. I don't believe I've ever had this fresh, but I have no regrets about aging it this long.",4.33
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2019 Vintage

Pours out a dark brown, nearly black liquid. Aggressive pour yields a half of a finger of khaki head. The foam sticks around for a while. It didn't look too thick on the way into the glass. Stouts just have a certain way of looking and you can guess that this might not be one.

Nose indicates that it's definitely not a stout. Coffee comes forward first, but not in your face with roasty qualities. There's actually a slight hint of sweet fruitiness that accompanies this coffee. Reminds me of Jamaican Blue with its delicate, fruit-forward tones. Next is the presence of molasses spice cookie. There's this mildly bitter, peppery, spicy sort of thing lurking underneath. It smells quite captivating so far, if a little on the weak side.

Taste is everything that was in the nose and more. A natural evolution. Mildly roasty and fruity coffee, cinnamon, bitter black strap molasses, a faint bourbon/oak, black pepper, but without the heat, and dark grainy bread. Along the lines of rye or pumpernickel. I got that in the previous B-Bomb I had as well. Very unique quality. These flavors unravel spectacularly, never once stepping over each others toes or vying for attention. Nicely balanced, not too bitter, not sickly sweet.

Mouthfeel is fullbodied and smooth. Not thick like a stout, but a nice density. Not too cloying, alcohol evaporation drying it up a little. Mild carbonation.

Overall a fantastic brew for the winter. A great sipper to have with friends and to ponder life and enjoy a snowy winter landscape. Cheers to Fremont who continuously knocks it out of the park.",4.53
Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"2019 version, aged at Fremont purchased through Tavour. My second version of B-bomb, but I haven't had the base beer yet.

This is well rounded and wonderfully balanced overall. The barrel presence is magnificent, no surprise from Fremont, rich with bourbon and mellow vanilla with hints of oaky leather. I want my funeral pyre built with spent staves from Fremont barrels.

Under all that was creamy cocoa, dates and raisins, caramel, subtle coffee, and dessert like cinnamon. This is wonderful as is, but I hope I get to try a fresh bottle someday with more assertive coffee notes.

Now having 2018, aged and purchased under the same circumstances. This version was a few bucks cheaper for some reason. This was drier and a bit roastier. Less cinnamon and surprisingly more coffee maybe. Just a bit less decadent than the 2019.

Edit 4/1/22 got my wish, now enjoying a fresh 2022 bottle. The coffee is more assertive but so is the cinnamon. I'm also getting a strong coconut note. Huge barrel presence but the figs , cocoa, and raisins are subdued. It's wonderful now, but I think I'll age the other for a year or so.",4.68

Coffee Cinnamon B-Bomb,"Poured from a bottle (2017 vintage) into a small tasting glass

L: pours a nice very dark black brown with a moderate tan khaki head. Fades after a minute or so, leaves a nice ring of foam around the edge when it does

S: nice and inviting nose, full without coming across heavy or sweet. Great chocolate aroma to open, solid roast coffee comes through as well. There’s a bit of cinnamon spice coming through as well, adds some nice complexity but doesn’t become a dominant note. A bit more cinnamon as it’s warmed, along with a small bit of abv heat

T: follows the nose well, a great dark chocolate note with dark roast coffee notes shining as well. That cinnamon comes through to add some nice depth, but again more playing a supporting role than really acting as a main flavor. This was as it was cold from the fridge - as it’s warmed that cinnamon comes through more, still not aggressive but a nice addition to the chocolate. Medium-long finish, with a nice bitter coffee/dark chocolate coming through. Abv works very well, provides that warming character without coming across hot

F: medium body, medium carbonation, would have liked it a bit thicker but not sure if that’s me thinking stout vs. winter warmer (what is the appropriate body for the style?)

O: a really nice winter warmer (not that I’ve had many in the style). Solid nose, great flavor - some age in the bottle has muted the adjuncts but I’d say they still come through well",4.5

S: cinnamon and lots of it. Bit of sugary caramel from the barrel.

T: wow! Again, loads of cinnamon both in flavor and in heat. I don't taste the coconut so much as feel it, it adds a lot of richness to the brew and leaves an oily, coconutty film after every sip. Bourbon barrel adds a lot of sweetness which balances everything out.

M: thick, heavy and oily

O: this is one hell of a winter warmer. The typical flavors are complimented and enhanced with the additions. This is an incredibly rich and sweet dessert beer, make no mistake. Startlingly good beer, one of the best I've had in a long while",4.65

4th Anniversary,"Cloudy orange with a fat finger of dense, off-white foam head. Good retention and thick lacing.

Big pineapple aroma with tropical Starburst, dank jungle weed and mango beneath.

Pineapple-forward taste as well, coupled with an interesting herbal note that lends some slight bitterness in the finish. There was fairly strong Playdoh in there at first, too; it might have been connected to the head, because it faded after the first few sips.

Full bodied with fairly zippy carbonation.

The nose is well, fairly minimal. Which surprises me. I'm just getting a faint citrus from it. Just a hint of pineapple, and grapefruit. Very minimal.
Taste - Now the taste is another thing all together from the aroma. This is a VERY hoppy beer. There's just a ton of citrus in it. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange - all there. Tons of hops in the flavor.
This beer is thick as heck here, which doesn't surprise me one bit. The hops just cling to my throat, and don't let go at all.
While this beer is light in the aroma department, it more than makes up in every other category. Another damn solid beer from Other Half.",4.3

Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Aged bottle. Jet black with hints of brown shading, brown cap. This one is more fitting of the dark lord moniker as it doesn't hold anything back. Huge bourbon booze starts the nose with chocolate fudge, roasted malt, coffee, solid rustic oak, molasses, dried dark fruit, and vanilla. Taste is much the same as the nose but not as nuanced, barrel stays strong, vanilla steps up, caramel enters in, dark fruit fades away. Feel is big, boozy and dark, just what they are going for, even with some age it still bites. I'm sure this will be controversial but I like the non-ba version better as an all around RIS, but when in the mood for a beast of a beer this will suffice, tough certainly on the sweeter end",4.29
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"I've been chasing this beer for a while now - bottle counts always seem lower than other adjuncted variants, and no one seems to want to let one go. So, finally caught it on tap this year!

The beer obviously changes a bit in the barrel (see all of the variants) - what once was a cloyingly unpleasant, overly sweet beer turns in to a much more balanced, not-insultingly sweet beer that almost has a sort of buttery taste and aroma to it. It's thick and rich, of course, with lightly disguised bourbon. This feels like a trick. I almost wondered whether I had the right beer.

It's great - it still lets me down a bit, after these years of chasing... still, great.",4.35
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"2nd DL variant. Regular DL is good but the variants that I have tried (BBA, CHEMTRAIL, FVM, RRARI CROCHET, LOADSTAR, PORTUGUESE BRANDY BA) were all amazing.",4.6
Hellaboozie (Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout),"Appearance - The beer poured dark color with a creamy mocha head topping off the pour.

Smell - The sweetness of Dark Lord met with bourbon. The nose was sweet, but not cloying.

Taste - What made this beer great was the sense of balance. The cloying, soy sauce-like, sweetness that many associate with regular Dark Lord is balanced with bourbon. What became of the combination is smooth sticky heat.

Mouthfeel - The beer was silky smooth with light carbonation and a slick sweetness. The body did not seem as thick as some of the other variants.

Overall - It is amazing what a plain bourbon barrel will do to Dark Lord.",4.9
Saison Du Fermier,"Thank you not2quick for this one!

750ml bottle - blend 5 - poured into a chalice at 50°F.

Pours a clear, deep straw-golden hue, with just a cast of unfiltered fog, and a finger of creamy, soft, off-white head, eventually settling to a thick collar leaving some lacing behind. Visible effervescence.

Nose: Soft, pale rustic grains, with crackery wheat and some round malted barley lend secondary notes of wet hay, dewy grass, and some dusty silo. There is some remarkable floral character, lending spring blossoms like lilac and hyacinth, with lemon blossom, wet stony minerality, and a lightly musty oakiness. Some very restrained white vinous notes, along with a touch of pear, apple, and apricot. Gentle hints of honey, lemon zest, and some phenolic peppery notes wrap it all up in a beautifully soft and rustic olfactory display.

Palate: Saison du Fermier greets the palate with simultaneous waves of gentle lemony tang, semi-sweet grist with some crackery, bready, and rustic grainy notes, and an explosion of bright, shimmery fruity notes. Lemon, nectarine, apricot, tart white plum, green apple, Asian pear, and a sweet-tart balance of fruity white grape. There's a bright but balanced minerality pushing these flavours to the front, along with some wet limestone. Some Belgian-like saison yeast brings that fruity, undertone with a bit of peppery spice intermingling with a touch of herbal hops. Finish is oaky, dry, and lightly tannic.

Mouthfeel/Body: It's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a tight, snappy crispness - bright and fluid, but there's enough grain to lend some softness and presence. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy, but fine enough to stay soft and fluffy. Tart and wet up front, finishing with an increasingly dryness, and a touch of cling.

Overall: A lot of the fruited and more recent Side Project offerings have been trending more and more acidic, which can really bring it down fast. This one shows the balance and softness that I know they're capable of. It retains much of that classic Belgian saison character, while contributing the classic Side Project culture and grist character. Soft, balanced, bright, and absolutely dialed in. A top tier American oak-aged saison.",4.26

Truth,"Oh man, I’m excited for this one. My last beer from my latest run to Tree House, and one that hasn’t been released in many years. Currently sitting at #84 of all time on BA, we have a straight up, no adjunct barrel aged Stout blend. Let’s crack open this special bottle

Pours nearly pitch black and still, with just a small layer of tan bubbles than quickly fade to a thin ring that leaves no lacing but nice legs

While I appreciate this not having the typical TH Stout sweetness in the nose, it’s not as complex as I had hoped though still good. I’m picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, dark roast coffee, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla, light brown sugar, and raisin

It is sweet in taste, but not in any cloying way, rather it is kept wonderfully in check by many complex notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting milk chocolate, plum, vanilla, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, black cherry, and burnt caramel. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, boozy bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, molasses, black cherry, pecan, toasted oak, and dark roast coffee

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick and sweet beer. Finishes sticky and heavy but not overwhelmingly sweet

So this is very good, but I wouldn't consider it among the best of the best. Regardless, it was super fun to try, and a nice beer to wind down with",4.35
Truth,"750 ml bottle.

Gentle pour brings a pure jet black motor oil color with a finger of caramel head. Good retention for the style. Leaves a halo of lacing around the glass. Settles into a thin film laid carefully across the beer.

The aroma brings strong notes of bourbon, dark fruits, caramel, dark chocolate, and pecans with loads of vanilla, oak, toffee, dark roast coffee beans, light char and a bit of smoke.

The flavor has tons of chocolate fudge and chocolate chip cookies. There's loads of Hazelnut coffee, toasted pecans and almonds, as well as bourbon, vanilla, oak, fig, plum and caramel. Boozy but at 12.3% this should be expected. A lot going on here but it all works perfectly together.

The feel is full bodied, chewy and syrupy. Almost no carbonation but plenty of booze, as expected.

Overall, I might be a Tree House fanboy but I've been quite critical of their stouts in recent years. They've become a bit too sweet with minimal balance. Just chocolate syrup. This bad boy, however, is one of the rare barrel aged stouts they have. Fortunately, I didn't pay anything for the beer as the bottle was shared with a friend.

This is definitely one of the best beers I've ever had. The bourbon is certainly present, but doesn't overpower the beer like other BA stouts. It's sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Boozy, but not overly so.",4.83
Truth,"Brewery pour. Appearance was sludge...completely opaque. Hard pour leading to a very small mocha colored head with tiny bubbles. Aroma was dark fruits, toffee, bourbon, caramel and a hint of vanilla. Flavor was as the aroma. Bourbon was a bit more pronounced but didn't over power anything else the beer offered. Layers of flavor and complexity here. Mouthfeel was THICK. Sludgy oil down my gullet. Mouth coating to say the least. Tiny bubbles of carbonation danced on my tongue. Overall, this is an outstanding non adjunct BA offering. Really impressed with this as a non blended barrel aged offering from Tree House. Wish I would've purchased a bottle to take home.",4.54

Review #2100

Medium bodied dark brown/black appearance. Somewhat thinner in appearance and lighter in color than I anticipated. The beer was topped by a small cap of bubbly, cappuccino colored froth that quickly broke apart. A medium sized halo encircled the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially but somewhat subtle. Malty notes dominated. Roasted malts were most apparent. Good dose of caramel malt character too. Moderately sweet. Slightly smoky. Almost a touch peaty. Dark fruits were also detectable. Raisins, plums and figs perhaps. There was a bit of a papery oxidative quality as well, but this subsided with time. As the beer sat, the aroma intensified. The dark fruits, the sweetness and the smoke became notably punchier.

The flavor profile followed the nose. Rich and malty up front but less intense than anticipated. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malts. Slightly smoky. Boozy notes kicked in as the beer moved along the palate. Port soaked raisins came to mind. There was a bit of a chocolate/Tootsie Roll-like character too. Subtle metallic notes appeared on the back end, but they dissipated with time. More lingering booze and sweetness on the finish.

The mouthfeel was solid but thinner bodied for a beer of this magnitude. Smooth and slick on the palate. The liquid contained a fine, moderate effervescence that fluffed up nicely on the palate.

Tree House make some amazing adjuncted milk stouts, but their purely barrel-aged releases seem to be a bit lacking in intensity and mouthfeel. While this was an enjoyable beer, it did little to stand apart from the pack.",4.3
Truth,"I’m the resident TH fan but this is damn good! Chocolate, vanilla bourbon & almost everything you’d want from a BA (no adjunk) stout. If I’m picking nits (I am) it doesn’t have quite the flavor pop as something like BBT but does have similar complexity",4.71
Bourbon Paradise,"Look - Fantastic looking BA Stout! Black and thick with a really nice thick tan head and fantastic rimming and lacing. Not sure what you can do better
Smell - nutty dark chocolate woody smell. I'm sure that nut smell comes from the coconut but I don't get the coconut, more just nut. maybe some molasses caramel deep in there
Taste - a little sweet but not overly sweet. dark chocolate some char woodiness along with the toasted coconut and vanilla.
Feel - Medium full body with a medium light carb, slight creaminess
Overall - I like how the vanilla and coconut aren't overly done and instead just bring out some great flavors of the beer in different ways. The Barrel to this beer is fantastic. Well done not overly sweet BA Stout",4.45
Bourbon Paradise,"Fantastic! Before getting into the flavor, I greatly appreciate this brew being offered in 12 oz bottles. Though I enjoy drinking socially, I do most of my drinking solo, which makes those 16 oz plus bottles a challenge. That might be the wimpiest thing I've said this week. I should probably go start my lawnmower in one pull to make up for that. As for the flavor, both the coconut and vanilla come through, but hold back from dominating the flavor profile. I liken it to Phil Anselmo holding back in Cemetery Gates, unleashing at just the right time. It goes without saying, but drink this one slowly, as the flavor profile changes as it warms. Enjoy the ride.",4.7
Bourbon Paradise,"Appearance - The beer poured thick blackness with brown bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - Dark chocolate was most prominent in the nose. Coconut was faint in the nose.

Taste - Initially, the dark chocolate led the way. It was like a bourbon barrel aged Mounds bar. The chocolate and coconut worked so well together. The sweetness of the coconut was most prominent in back. The bourbon made for a warming finish.

Mouthfeel - The body was thick with roasted chocolate. Carbonation was largely non-existent.

Overall - This was a great coconut stout.",4.68
Bourbon Paradise,"Packaged on 11/20/2020 - consumed on 3/13/2022. Poured from a 12oz bottle into my Portsmouth tulip.

Dark seal brown to bistre body with a thin fawn/camel collar. Vague lacing; fast running legs; poor retention.

Vanilla, barrel char, bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of tobacco, molasses, cocoa, and toffee in the nose.

Intense palate entry - all of the flavors above but concentrated. Rather sweet, with a long chocolate-laden finish. Some barrel/alcohol elements along with a gentle, clean bitterness add a little balance. Stewed dark fruit notes emerge as the ale warms. Neutral yeast character. Coconut and vanilla seem a little redundant, overwhelming their counterparts in the bourbon flavor, and reinforcing the borderline cloying impression.

Silky, almost oily, rich mouth-feel with active yet low carbonation. Moderately warming.

More on the dessert end of the spectrum for the style, but very potent with some balanced barrel influence. Enjoyed it more than my notes might suggest.",4.14
Bourbon Paradise,"Little to no head. Only a very thin tan ring clinging to the glass. Very dark like dark chocolate cake. The nose is chocolate and more chocolate. Bourbon comes right out of the middle of the chocolate. Vanilla and barrel leak out at the end. The taste has bourbon, vanilla, and oak jumping right out. Chocolate and a small hint of coconut follow. There is a small bit of spice that hides behind the coconut at the finish. The mouthfeel is a bit thin but with the right amount of carbonation. This is a wonderful beer. It wants to be too sweet but stops just short and balances out to make you smile. (Found old notes on this one)",4.52
Bourbon Paradise,"2019 version enjoyed 27 months later.

Pours pitch black with a finger of fizzy, dark mocha, almost reddish head that fizzes away almost instantly. When swirled, it coats the glass with a dark film.

Aroma is light coconut and even lighter vanilla as expected from the extended aging. This allows the base stout and barrel to shine more. Dark chocolate, black cherry, tobacco, roasted malt, some peat, and molasses from the base and some charred oak and bourbon from the barrel.

Taste brings more of the adjuncts than expected given the aroma, but they're still quite light given today's ""pastry stout"" standards. Toasted coconut and light vanilla bean dance in the background while the barrel treated stout is at the forefront. Bakers chocolate, some bittersweet chocolate chip, roasted malt, some peat, tobacco, black cherry, some fig, molasses, some brown sugar, charred oak, bourbon spirit. I'm sure there's some vanillin and even possibly some coconut coming from the barrel, but it's hard to tell if that character is from the adjuncts or the barrel.

Medium to high medium body. Slick, oily, sticky, warming. Could use a bit more body. Doesn't drink like 16%, but you know you're drinking a big beer.

I know I shouldn't have sat on this as long as I did because I'm sure there was a lot more coconut and vanilla character; however, the base and barrel integration are top notch and allowing the adjuncts to subside has shown this. It also has led to what I'd imagine is a smoother drinking experience than when it was fresher. I'm sure a fresher version of this would meet my expectations more, but this is still a very enjoyable beer at where it's currently at.",4.13
Bourbon Paradise,"Poured a black body with minimal head and touch of lace patches but those quickly dissipate. The aroma is mostly booze to me, although some sugariness comes in as well so assume this is vanilla. Smooth beer, kind of buttery it's so slick, with a hot and boozy taste and feel with vanilla sweetness but also some slickness from hints of coconut. Real easy to drink for a slow sipper and there is a good amount of chocolate throughout the beer that balances well with the vanilla and coconut.",4.13
Bourbon Paradise,"BBA imperial (13.7% abv) stout featuring vanilla and coconut...

Nothing wrong here, but its an unexceptional take on the style - that said, yes - you get bourbon, you get vanilla, and you get coconut, too - high-abv stout body with appropriate chocolatiness and coffee - maybe I'm just jaded - this 12 oz. bottle was $9.99 IIRC - Prairie being notoriously high-priced (right? lol) - so in sum, you get what they advertise, but to my tastes it doesn't do anything with the ingredients that elevates it above peer drinks, or to justify the price... Fans of vanilla and coconut BBA stouts will absolutely dig this though...",4.0
Bourbon Paradise,"$12.99 per 12 oz. 13.7% ABV. Poured into a small-stemmed tulip.

Too much upon the first sip. Of course, after the initial shock your taste buds acclimate a bit. But overall, this ale goes too far with is coconut, vanilla, and sweetness. Thought the barrel-aging contributes to these faults I do not believe that’s where the mistakes were made. 3.5

A – Pours an opaque oily black, viscous with zero head. Syrupy. An alcohol “wedge” (not legs) on the glass. 4.25

S – Sweet, vanilla, bourbon barrel, coconut is on the faint side and seems to be overwhelmed by the other aromas. There are some roasted aromas as well, but behind everything else. A very complex aroma. 4.0

T – Coconut!!! Sweet. Alcohol is well hidden. No bitterness. Sweetness is a combo of the coconut and the brown sugar flavors. No spiciness to balance, just the ABV. 3.5

MF – Heavy bodied, sweet with a spirited finish, but not hot. 3.75",3.69
Bourbon Paradise,"Pours pitch black with a dark tan head. Fits the style perfectly, IMHO. The nose is led by the bourbon, but it’s surprisingly not too hot, and there’s a really nice vanilla note to accompany the dark chocolate and char notes, and there’s maybe a smidge of coconut.

Dark chocolate leads the taste, accompanied by the bourbon, and balanced by the vanilla and a more substantial coconut flavor. This is hefty and brawny, yet also well balanced, something that requires a lot of skill from the brewery in my experience. Prairie definitely has that skill set.

The mouthfeel is rich and slightly creamy, well suited to the beer. I really liked the base beer - a LOT - and this is better, IMHO. World class stuff here.",4.5

The Rusty Nail,"2022 batch, 13.6% ABV.

Pours a nearly pitch-black color. Befitting a huge, barrel-aged monster, there isn't much head, just a tan collar topping it off.

The aroma, though, is out of this world good. The focus here is on roasted malt, espresso, licorice, and baker's cocoa. A light touch of smoke gives it another layer of depth. There's a tiny hint of cinnamon lingering around, which is good: too much cinnamon would have hurt its chances at greatness. And of course, the assertive bourbon barrels can't be overlooked. Tons of oak, vanilla, and bit of corn shine through.

While the taste doesn't follow the nose super-close, it's wonderful in its own way. It starts off with a nice, sweet cinnamon flavor lacking the bitter spice of other (frankly lesser) cinnamon-adorned beers. Same with the bourbony finish: it's subtle yet noticeable, without being massively assertive. Dark chocolate, espresso, roast, and licorice round out the middle - again, enough to make you think, but not enough to overpower. There's a ton of stuff going on with this one, and actually coalesces together into something harmonious and complex instead of complicated and sloppy. The more I consume, the more I love it, therefore it earns an elusive 5 taste-wise.

It's not as texturally slick or slimy as other big oatmeal stouts, but by no means is it bone-dry. I could use a touch more body and thickness, but that's me nitpicking for the sake of picking nits. It's still as creamy and decadent as one could want from a monster barrel-aged stout. Carbonation is low, but it doesn't need much anyways since the oak tannins cleanse the palate decently.

I'm always that guy saying beer X doesn't live up to the hype or wondering how the hell beer Y earned a 100. This, though, this lives up to the hype and then some. It's one of the most complex stouts I've ever sampled, and - like I said - isn't complex in a ""some is good, therefore too much is even better"" kind of way. It's wonderfully cohesive and well-rounded in a way stouts not even a fourth as deep are. An absolute masterpiece, seek it out yesterday!",4.7
The Rusty Nail,"Look: like an imp stout should. Deep and dark. Some slight ruby/cola highlights around the edges when held to light. Modest mocha head on the pour that mostly recedes. Some oily, messy lacing that doesn’t stick around long.

Taste: cinnamon and chocolate sweetness up front, countered by a nice roasty, slightly bitter char in the finish.",4.59
The Rusty Nail,"Sampling this 2021 vintage 22 oz bottle poured into my trusty snifter. Beer is part of a swap with @Resistance88 thank you!
The beer pours a thick , jet black coffee color with a dense brown head foaming up about 2 cm and gently cresting over the edge of my glass. No spillage out and no light passing through either. Looks the part of an imperial stout for sure.
the dense creamy head fades slowly to a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense coating lattice on each sip or swirl of the glass.
The aroma on this beer is complex and enticing, there is some dark chocolate and a bit of roasted malts and almost charred note. I also definitely get cinnamon, but its not artificial like Big Red, very earthy cinnamon note. Also some bourbon notes come through here. I dont get licorice that is on the label, which is okay as I dont tend to like anice/licorice aroma or flavor too much. I dont get any booze here which is impressive at 13.3%. Also not much if anything for a hop profile on the nose.

First sip reveals a full, thick body with soft gentle and fine carbonation. Beer feels nice on my palate and does give a bit of a coating on my lips with each sip.
Flavor follows the notes advertised on the nose. I get dark chocolate and some bourbon with hints of dark chocolate rolling through. Some warming and earthy cinnamon pops up, and this flavor lingers along with a bit of warmth, or is THAT the abv which was hidden on the nose?? Not really any char or heavy roast notes here. The bourbon does come back very dominant on the burps. Hops, we dont need no stinkin hops! I dont get any on the flavor profile.
So the warmth could be booze or cinnamon, its not hot, just slightly warm.
The beer does drink pretty easy for its heft and I do enjoy it a lot. I got a second bottle of another beer to open after this, but I may just sip this one all night.
Very good brew!",4.56
The Rusty Nail,"Pour as black as black can be and the light brown head was sparse, short and faded quickly.
The aroma spoke more of bourbon than oatmeal, which is typical, (Oatmeal generally affects to feel more than the flavor for me in most cases) but I wasn't sure what to expect. The malts were very present, rich and deep. Strong coffee, cinnamon and bakers cocoa all made their appearance.
Taste followed, no new surprises awaited me except the sheer level of flavors that came at me. The prior BA stout today I could have (and would have) consumed a bomber of, but this one somehow go through to me rational mind that finishing it tonight would not be wise.

Alright, I've obtained the highest rated Oatmeal Stout! This title used to of course belong to Founders Breakfast Stout, but the restructuring of BA rankings shifted it to this. I am very excited to dive into this massive beast, which is also my first beer from Fremont. Let's see what this is all about

Pours pitch black with 2 fingers of dark brown head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, even after 2 years the cinnamon in this thing is still super prevalent. I'm picking up on aromas of cinnamon bark, milk chocolate, caramel, toasted oak, spicy bourbon, light char and black licorice. Very earthy and raw

The earthy and spicy notes from the aroma is still present in taste, but it focuses much more on the smoother, somewhat sweet notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, fruity coffee, earthy cinnamon, caramel, toasted oak, and light raisin. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, spicy bourbon, dark chocolate, black licorice, dark cherry, molasses, and spent coffee beans

A medium full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a creamy and lightly zesty beer. Finishes slightly sticky but dries over time. Decadent but not overly sweet

This is a fantastic beer. It is incredibly creamy, balanced, and complex. I would love to know what this is like fresh but this is a treat regardless",4.54
The Rusty Nail,"2020 release, enjoyed mid-February 2022. This is a very serious beer. Wow. Been chasing it for over a decade and happy to score a few back in 2020 and sitting on them for about a year and a half. Super sweet but not cloying, roasty and smoky without being off-putting. Pretty boozy in the nose, signifying it could use even more time to mellow. Luckily I have another bottle for years down the road. So smooth and easy-drinking but SO full of complex flavors. The best flavor in the finish is roasted marshmallows, without a doubt. Such a fun beer to drink. Epic stuff.",4.59
The Rusty Nail,"2021 Limited Release. Found quite a few of these Fremont gems at Albany, Oregon Winco. Poured from a wax sealed 20 oz into a 16oz glass.

Look: poured nearly black with almost no head.

Smell: notes of licorice and dark chocolate with a little bit of coffee.

Taste: one of the most intense and smoothest aged oatmeal stouts that I have ever had. No “cough syrup” sting, but notes of licorice, chocolate, and cherry. Nice finish, very smooth.

Feel: smooth and bold.

I am a huge fan of Fremont, so there is some bias. In winters past, my wife loved barrel aged imperial stouts, so this type of “beer” is familiar. This is intense. I’m half way through the bottle (by myself) for dinner and it continues to be an enjoyable sipping beer that will have me in good spirits for the rest of the night. I’m interested in the other bottles of limited release after enjoying this.",4.48
The Rusty Nail,"2020 vintage. Received from @snaotheus in the NBS BIF #14. Poured into a snifter at 63°. It pours an oily black with a half finger of creamy, medium-mocha head and thin coating of lacing. Very pretty. Its smell offers roasted malt, dark chocolate, burnt coffee, pepper, earthy char, and a strong bourbon aroma. The taste is sublime! Like a dessert. It features dark chocolate, oatmeal, cinnamon, burnt coffee, anise, and a strong dose of bourbon. The flavors are distinct but blend magnificently. The result is delicious. The mouth feel is terrific: thick and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and the 13.3% ABV is warming but not distracting. Overall, The Rusty Nail is a magnificent Oatmeal Stout; the best example of the style I've had. It excels in all categories. I'm grateful to have had the chance to enjoy it.",4.58
The Rusty Nail,"Pours a viscous, oily, pitch black with a finger of mocha head quickly receding to a decent ring and leaving plenty of residual lacing.

O- plenty of barrel adds a great complexity to the base beer, with the cinnamon adding a nice enhancement",4.54
The Rusty Nail,"The Rusty Nail (2021 Release) from Freemont. Received a 22 oz bomber in a LIF from @snaotheus. Stored at home at 38 degrees. Reviewed 24/10/21. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Served at 56.8 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King snifter. Final temperature 60.4 degrees.
Appearance – 4.25.
First pour – Black (SRM 40), opaque.
Body – Black (SRM 40), opaque. When rear-lite, same, although some light does penetrate the edge and appears red.
Head – Average (Maximum 1.5 cm, aggressive center pour), brown sugar, high density, fizzy, quickly diminishing to a one to four mm bubble ring and no cap. Second pour produces a 0.9 cm head.
Lacing – None, hardly unexpected at 12.3% ABV.
Aroma – 3.75 – Initially weak licorice, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no cinnamon, faint bourbon as it warms, no oak.
Flavor – 4.25 – Begins with the sweet taste of licorice and dates, no hops, no malt, no yeast. No cinnamon. Weak bourbon on the exhale with no oakiness. No ethanol (12.3 % ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma. Moderate gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy approaching syrupy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 This is one of those rare brews that looks the same in the glass as it does during the pour. It has a bit of the candi sugar feel of a Belgian brew, a bit sweet. The oats serve well, adding a luscious velvety feel across the palates. Unfortunately for my taste buds, the cinnamon is deeply buried and I’m not sure if I’m actually tasting it or only hoping that I am. As the temperature approaches 61 degrees, the alcohol begins to predominate, so it’s time to chug the remainder. Overall, a decent brew but one that is temperature (and possibly age) dependent.",4.13
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2020 vintage

Oh man, we have quite the big boy here. A 21% on a Tuesday afternoon? What the hell am I doing? Well, I’m on vacation this week and today turned out to be a stormy day, so I figured it’s the perfect time to crack this beer I received in a BIF from the legendary @Eziel. I’m getting close to the end of what he sent me, and they’re all heavy hitters. Let’s see what this one is all about

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of light beige head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There’s a definite sweetness in the nose, but it’s wonderfully balanced given its size. I’m picking up on aromas of chocolate fudge, earthy bourbon, toasted oak, nougat, black cherry, sweet caramel, molasses, toasted hazelnut, and light vanilla

This one really packs a punch in taste, heavy booze and char fight for attention while a huge sweetness backs it all up. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting charred oak, cacao, sweet bourbon, red grape, marshmallow, sweet vanilla, molasses, toffee, light nutty malt, and black cherry. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, charred oak, nougat, cacao, black cherry, molasses, apple brandy, vanilla, sweet caramel, and nougat

A full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky and slightly thick beer. Finishes mostly dry but boozy as all hell

There’s no 2 ways about it; this beer is incredible. So complex and hitting all the right notes. Perfect for a quiet day to myself hanging out outside while it rains",4.52
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2021 batch. Most of the BT Reserve years is two sets of bourbon barrels, but this one is grape brandy and then bourbon.

This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and no lacing.

This smells like charred oak, lots of bourbon, lots of vinous grape character, brandy, roasted malt, dark fruit.

This is a nice bridge between some of overtly wine based Black Tuesday variants, and the regular bourbon Black Tuesday. The grape brandy adds a pleasantly oaky vinous character, sweet, but finishes dry, with oaky char, marshmallow, dark chocolate, caramel, roast, and bourbon.

This is medium bodied, slightly thin as most Black Tuesday variants tend to be, with a lots of concentrated booziness. It’s not overwhelmingly boozy, but it really kind of does drink like a distilled stout liqueur.

I haven’t had much Bruery in a while, but this was definitely a fun beer to revisit this brewery with. It’s definitely something to share with a bunch of people, like 10 people, maybe, but it’s well done.",4.22
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"750 ml wax capped bottle, 2021 edition (aged in Copper & Kings grape brandy barrels for a year, then aged an additional year in bourbon barrels), 21.8% ABV, bottled 01/19/21. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with not quite an inch tan head that fizzled away somewhat quickly. I like the aroma a lot, the brew smells like dark fruit, brandy, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark chocolate and roasted malt. I like the taste a lot too, it's similar to the aroma but with the addition of some dark bread, burnt/charred malt, coffee, licorice and earthy flavors. There's a lot going on here, but all of the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's coating and a bit syrupy with a moderate amount of carbonation. Nowhere near as boozy as I was expecting considering how strong this brew is! Certainly worth trying if you get the chance to!",4.56
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"I believe this was a 2018 bottle (4 years aged). Leaned towards a more licorice flavor. Didn’t pick up much bourbon. Solid beer/liquor drink (20% it’s hard to still consider this a beer). My guess is that perhaps it’s a little better if it were fresher, maybe 6-12mo age which is generally where I like my BA stouts.",4.33
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"2015 vintage
Look: very dark. Some cola highlights when held to light. Sparse head of course.
Smell: mellow Black Tuesday underneath. Vanilla, bourbon fudge.
Taste: like the nose. Unbelievably mellow for such a monster.",4.8
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Review #8000, 2015 vintage. This will be a very emotional review. Normally for big milestones like this, rudzud would have some crazy beer to share, but that can't happen now. Instead this was one from our share box that we got from Hoarders, saving for a special day. He might not be here physically to share it with me, but he's here in spirit.

Pours basically with no head, whisp of fizzy bubbles disappears almost instantly, dark murky molasses brown color with no real light coming through, and legs for days

Nose brings lots of barrel and bourbon, lots of vanilla oak, a bit buttery oak, fresh bourbon barrel juice, a bit like my nose in a Glencairn glass with some decent bourbon, lots of dark malts under that, some roast and coffee, no char, loads of cocoa, dark chocolate, a little nougat candy bar, fudge, a bit of a chocolate syrup as well, a little alcohol

Taste super rich heavy malts and barrel, dark chocolate, raw cocoa, chocolate syrupy again, a bit of a candy bar with light nougat and caramel notes, some roast and coffee as well, more like a coffee syrup, barrel brings lots of vanilla again and fresh bourbon barrel juice, a little generic whiskey character but some raw sweet bourbon as well, getting fudgey in the middle, some toasted oak character and layers of vanilla, a touch of baking spice, med lighter bitterness mostly from the roasted malts, some hot alcohol not quite fusel but almost there, finishes sticky and coats the mouth, never really goes away, lingering cocoa, fudge, vanilla and generic whiskey

Mouth is full bod, rich syrupy and really coats the mouth, some hot tingly alcohol, med-light foamy carb

Overall quite nice, there have been better Bruery beers, but for a Black Tuesday variant adding the extra bourbon and barrel was nice, although I think it has dropped a bit from what it probably was fresh, but alcohol didn't destroy either as the age probably helped there.

I swear I heard a pop sound from my glass while it was resting and I was typing. Matt must have taken his sip, and I hope he enjoyed it. Miss the great bottle shares and fun times. This was just one more milestone in my reviews. I know rudzud always joked about how he would never catch me in reviews, and I guess he was right. I'll keep drinking beers, but I'll always have that hole that will never be filled. Cheers Matt!",4.55
Black Tuesday - Reserve,"Very good head production, considering the sky high ABV and double barrel aging. Quickly fades, as expected, leaving behind only a thin ring of foam around the edge. Body is surprisingly clear and cola-colored.

Boozy nose - whoda thunkit? The smell of bourbon, port, and brown sugar wafts over you from the pour itself. Up close it's similar but stronger: red grape, molasses, chocolate, brown sugar, oak, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, honeycomb.

Strong, sweet, and boozy on the palate, with an alcoholic burn that grows and grows. Very slow sipper. Lasting heat in the throat and chest.

Incredibly deep and complex, rich and dark. Molasses, brown sugar, oak, bourbon mash, red grape, white bread, light toast, toffee, vanilla, espresso. Long aftertaste, although the booze understandably dissipates rather quickly.",4.56
The Peach,"Cloudy yellowy orange body, white cap settles into a collar quickly. Big peach nose, big barnyard funk, lesser so horse blanket funk, oak more than the cognac support but both there, slight floral notes too. Tart and somewhat earthy peach starts the taste before the dry and sharp funk massages the oak and light cognac into the peach, apricot, lemon, green apple all support, but finish doesn't elevate, rather it goes somewhat acidic with a hint of balsamic vinegar. Feel is bright, sour, decently acidic cumulatively, and funky, almost feel more vinous on the finish. Very nice peach wild ale. The 6th best? No, but still great on a cool summer afternoon on the porch",4.37
The Peach,Holy peach!!! Love peaches in sours and this one is absolutely loaded with them. Pours and smells great and it tastes like a darn peach bomb. Unbelievable sour!,4.5
The Peach,"750ml bottle, aged in oak barrels, undated, poured into a stemless wine glass.

The beer pours a bright peach color, orange and gold hues, cloudy with a finger of fizzy white head that dissipates quickly leaving no lacing. The aroma is wonderful, lots of fresh peach, bright and lightly tart with a nice floral quality, underlying fruitiness, lightly bacterial with a nice funk, soft oak and earthiness. The flavors are great, tons of peach, juicy, fresh, bright and tart with a nice oak barrel, sweet and chewy with a nice mustiness and funkiness while a soft floral bouquet opens up as it warms. The mouthfeel is good, coating with a delicate and lively medium body that has a nice tartness and finishes with a lightly dry bite.

Verdict: A nice wild ale from de Garde. Lots of peach, bright, fresh, just a touch sweet that really demonstrates the great qualities of the peach.",4.26
Supplication,"Bottled 7/2/17 and received courtesy of @dimidiata. Fairly clear, amber color coming out of the bottle, settling to a deeper semi-translucent caramel once in the glass. The aroma initially struck me as typical wild brett funk, but upon closer inspection the cherry and wine barrel notes revealed themselves in a pleasantly discreet way.

Taste is wonderfully........different. This is unlike any beer I can recall in recent memory. The cherries are remarkably present after 5 years, but the wine barrel combined with the earthy funk is what's really making this one interesting. Plenty of sweet malts up front, but then the funk emerges mid-palate and into the aftertaste. Fairly full bodied and lightly carbonated.

Overall, very interesting and very good beer.",4.21
Supplication,"Brief Review:

O: My 2nd of 3rd RR sours I picked up from SF. This may be their highest rated. Nice brown ale with cherries, almost like a Flander's. Not too tart, which I like. Flavors are nice and clean. Good balance overall.

Recommendation: Doesn't really blow me away for a sour with this kind of reputation, but it drinks nice and is a good Spring/Summer beer.",4.49
Supplication,Wild! Received this from a good friend in the Bay Area. Works for me - it’s complex and skewed towards sour funkiness… very much feels sophisticated.,4.45
Supplication,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $13.99. Bottled 4-27-21; consumed 4-26-22.

Beer poured a pretty raspberry with a smallish white head that dissipated pretty quickly.

Nose is nice, berry forward, nice bouquet.

Taste is really well done; a substantial but light malt base combines nicely with the pinot noir barrel which lends the dark berry fruit flavor and a touch of tartness. The introduced Brett lends some funkiness. It finishes with a dry oak barrel.

Mouthfeel i s light bodied and very easy to sip.

Overall even thought my funky sour pallet is underdeveloped i can see this is a really well made beer as it is so flavorful and light and not overwhelming. Buy this if you like the style!",4.4

Last but most certainly not least in my lineup if Russian River Wilds is Supplication, the 8th highest rated of the style and 101st overall. It’s been a fun journey working through all of these, and I hope to drink them all again in the future. For now, let’s see what this one has to offer

Pours a opaque brownish orange with 2 fingers of off white head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Wow, this is a full on assault in the nose and I’m loving it. I’m picking up on aromas of dark cherry, old leather, brown sugar, fresh oak, lemon yogurt, vanilla, rich red wine, light vinegar, caramel, and light plum

It is just so rich in taste, and not really the sour bomb you expect from the aroma. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark cherry, tangy red wine, fresh oak, lemon juice, toffee, apple skin, wet hay, and light cellar. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, stewed dark fruit, red wine vinegar, blackberry, black pepper, brown bread, and pear skin

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a tangy beer. Finishes slightly sticky but tart enough to cut through most of it

This is a fantastic beer. It's certainly one of (if not the) best Russian River Wilds I had in this run, and it swings in the same class as the best of the style. So delicious but I'm sad that I've finished my last bottle!",4.51

I will start my day with a wild ale; I have tried most of the sours from RRB, they have been phenomenal. I used a tulip glass; the temperature was 44 degrees. The pour created a frothy and airy light tan head with poor retention. The quick dissipation left zero lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, dark amber with rusty orange hues. The beer is somewhat hazy. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.
When I pulled the cork out, wine and oak aromas emitted. Nosing further in the glass, I detect sour apple cider, funky barn, horse blanket, cherries, toasted crackers, and leather. Smelling the beer several times, I sense floral ester, a touch of phenols, and a slight fruity sweetness.
The beer's aromas are sharp but did do not relate to the taste. The flavors are brett, oak, vinous, sour apple cider, horse blanket, dankness, funky barnyard, herbal, hay, cherries, lightly toasted malts, leather, phenolic, and earthiness.
The mouthfeel is astringent, tart, and dry. The body of the beer is medium-light, high carbonation, and delightfully long finish.
This beer is incredible. One of the best sours I have consumed to date. I was bracing for the sourness to rip my palate apart; I got the latter, a delicate ballet on my tongue. Near perfect balance, nothing the beer is trying to outdo other flavors. I loved this beer!",4.84

Supplication,"The beer, poured into a wine glass developed a quick settling head atop it's murky copper hue. The aroma was what I had been craving. I was greeted with Brett and some nice funk. Notes of oak, fermenting red wine, and an aroma that I can only describe as impending tartness. There was also something fruity on the nose. The first sip was very funky and dry. The Brett was on full display and not much else. Over the next few sips the beer came to life. The funk mellowed a bit to give way to spicy oak, a bit of grain, and an increasing amount of fruit. This was all presided over by a bright but balanced tartness. A bit of carbonation lightened it up as it slowly faded from my palate. This was simply exquisite.",4.67
Supplication,"I'm probably being a little generous here with the rating but this is hands down the best beer I've ever tried. Found it in the back of total wine in the keg cooler, walked through the plastic curtains with the sensor lights flicking on to be greeted by this gem. ""Limit 2/customer"" a sign read, being the only beer brand back there it felt like I stumbled across the crystal skull of the alcohol superstore, and with 100pt rating I just had to try it. im not much of a beer person but this changed my view 100% and made me realize beers CAN be delicious and just as complex as wines and special spirits. I mean I made an account and am here now because of it right?

Served chilled in a frosted pint glass. Brick red-orange colored, Head Came less than 1/4 inch up when i poured. First sip slaps you in the mouth with a refreshing sour cherry taste but not too much to make you pucker, Mild notes of cream and white wine (from the pinot noir barrels im guessing), very light taste of grain (not yeasty though or overpowering) a bit of funkiness and overall extremely refreshing. Taste great all the way through to the end. Almost a fresh olive kind of taste imo, i think it'd pair well with a Topanade, seafood, grilled food & chimichurri or tapas. As I said best beer I've ever had and what introduced me to the beer conossuier world. Now I've got to try the rest of the line up at Russian river brewing Co! I've had other ""specialty beers"" and they never really moved me like this did. This one is definitely unforgettable.

Taste follows with a well blended red wine and candied cherries, oak follows with minimal grain, some oxidation but adds to the complexity of the beer.

They’re good, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t think I’d seek them out again. More sour than tart, quite dry on the finish. Lacking in any true funky flavor or character.

Continuing on with and nearing the end of my run of Russian River Wild Ales, we have the 9th highest rated of the style, and 104th overall. It seems that they’re really leaning heavily into the Americanized Lambic vibe with this one, so I’m interested to see if that holds true. Let’s find out

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with almost no head, just a ring of bubbles that leaves no lacing

Less than stellar looks aside, this one smells fantastic. I’m picking up on aromas of wet hay, white wine vinegar, acidic lemon juice, sharp oak, crackery malt, lime zest, white pepper, leather, and musty apple skin

Ok so the aroma was a knockout that had me expecting this to be super tart, but it leans into more of a restrained funk in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting apple skin, straw, lemon zest, old wood, white grape, and flowers. The swallow brings notes of white pepper, wet hay, old leather, apple skin, white wine vinegar, and light bready malt. Really good but pales in comparison to the aroma

A medium body pairs with gentle acidic carbonation, resulting in a crisp and funky beer. Finishes very dry with a slight tartness

This is good, but I suspect that, for some reason, 2 years on it has mellowed it out far too much. Seems odd for a Lambic-inspired beer, but based on reviews of fresh bottle this seems to have lost its bite. I'd love to try it fresh one day though",4.34

I am a fan of Russian River, Pliny the Younger still eludes my taste buds. Living where I do, getting any beer worthy of writing home is difficult. I saw a bunch of Russian River's wild ales, I knew they had to come home with me. This is a sour beer aged in wine barrels. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a frothy white one-fingered head. The retention lasted maybe 15 seconds, leaving no lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 6, golden with amber hues. The beer is somewhat clear with a load of carbonation bubbles.
Initial aromas in the beer are wine, funky barn, straw, damp earth, and lemons. Nosing further, I detect toasted crackers, horse blanket, oak, a hint of floral, and a touch of herbal.

The flavors in the beer are lemons, chardonnay, funky barn, horse blankets, straw, wheat, toasted crackers, a touch of apple cider, herbal, floral, and champagne-like flavor.

The mouthfeel of the beer is tart, tannic, and bright.

The body of the beer is light, high carbonation, and medium finish.

The beer has this explosion of sourness and funk. The wine barrel aging comes through pleasantly taking the edge off the sourness. I not sure if this my favorite offering from Russian River. This beer is a solid example of a wild ale, but I will not drink it again.",4.19
Beatification,"Currently ranked #6 in the ""Wild Ale"" Top beers list and #70 in the Top Beers list with a perfect score of 100.

375ml brown glass bottle with hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork served chilled into a tulip (as indicated is ideal on the label and even on the cork). Bottled 04/03/20.

""100% spontaneously fermented beer aged in wine barrels."" ""Barrel aged 9 to 36 months"" (that's quite a spread...). ""...fermented beer using only wild yeast and bacteria."" 6.00% ABV.

HEAD: None really...just a floater ring that's rather thin and weak, dissipating in under 10 seconds.

BODY: Also a bit thin and weak, and certainly dull with a depleted and dareisay undercarbonated look.

I imagine I'm going to enjoy this beer, but we're kidding ourselves if this is a perfect 5 for appearance.

AROMA: Oak, barrel-derived vanillin, white wine, still cidre, obvious lactic acid. The bacterial aromatics are much more subdued than I imagined they'd be coming in...they register, but it's not teeming with lactobacillus like so many American brewed sour ales (I'm looking at you, Cascade Brewing). Doesn't seem as full of life and bacteria-ridden as, say, Allagash's coolship ales, but it's enticing with promises of ample barrel character, microfloral intricacy, and diverse bacteria.

I don't get any of that wet cardboard character one sometimes finds in well-meaning sour ales and I find no signs of infection. Some green apple, sure, suggesting perhaps acetobacter. No vomit-redolent aromatics that would indicate butyric acid are present.

Aromatic intensity is average for the style, maybe even a bit on the timid side. Doesn't scream acidity, but it does seem acidic judging by the aroma.

TASTE & TEXTURE: Zaps with mellow acidity and puckering yet mellow bacteria, hitting on all fronts (pediococcus, brettanomyces yeast, and lactobacillus. Not a lactobomb, yielding to the lactobacillus without letting it dominate the beer's flavour profile.

I can't shake the feeling this would be better fruited. Some source of added sweetness would help counter its dry acidity; this lacks the tartness that often accompanies sourness and I think it's worse for it.

Smooth, smacky, deliberately undercarbonated (and to good effect, I might add, evoking a fine Brittany still cidre), a bit wet up front and a bit dry mid-body.

Oak and concomitant woodsy flavours tie the brew together without feeling in-your-face, but I could do with more barrel flavour myself...I'd guess this particular 2020 batch was aged closer to the 9 month minimum than the 36 month maximum in their claimed range, and that much to its detriment. I don't get barrel vanillin per se or rich toasted oak, and the wine character is decidedly lacking in terms of depth of flavour. I mean there's faint white wine - perhaps muted Chardonnay or Riesling - but it's not as overt or nuanced as I'd like.

Green apple/apple skins, orchard fruit, lime, rustic barnyard funkiness from well attentuated brettanomyces, scatterings of microflora (none of them as interesting as what one would find in a Senne valley sour), vinegar/acetic acid, grass, hay, maybe some faint clove/spice from aged hops.

I suppose the bacteria dominate. Maltwise, I don't get much beyond 2-row and maybe a kiss of Cantillon-like cereal grains. Far from a sweet ale, and I do think it'd be better off fruited as noted above.

OVERALL: It's not a holy shit son of a bitch ""man, you've got to try this!"" sour ale, and it's not even Russian River's best wine barrel aged sour ale (I'd tend to favour Supplication in that respect), but as an American imitation of Cantillon's spontaneously fermented sour ales, there's no doubt it's rather good, if not quite up there with the Allagash efforts in the category. I don't know that I'd shell out for it again at this price, but I'm glad to have gotten to try it. A long-time want and a damn solid ale, but I don't know that it beats the pants off your typical Belgian gueuze - many of which are easier to find than this and even as imports cost the same if not a biteen less.

I'm an unabashed Russian River fanboy, but while it's certainly rather good, the creme da la creme this is not, and how anyone can give this an honest to God perfect 100 rating given its obvious appearance issues (and what I imagine is to many troublesome undercarbonation) is beyond me.

B / GOOD",3.62
Beatification,"Poured from a 375ml bottle into a stemless wine glass

Look: Crystal clear straw gold with a thin bite head that dissipated quickly

Smell: Very Brett and funk forward. Jay, green apple skins, pears, salinity, oak.

Taste: Light and clean. Green apple skins, pears, white pepper, barnyard funk, light sweet tart and oak.

Feel: Light and clean. Almost aqueous. Drinks so well. Light acidity. Sweet with and off dry finish.

Overall: Just beautiful. I wish the carbonation was up a bit but overall this is a beer that needs to be experienced. The sum is greater then its parts. A description doesn’t do it justice. Pick it up if you see it.",4.47
Beatification,"I don’t know and I don’t care. This beer to me is anything you want it to be. Lying in a meadow with her; standing on top of a mountain peak overlooking the world, or simply sitting your ass on the couch and cold hard chilling. Because it’s beautiful. It just hits me, it caresses me ever so softly. And if I could, I would caress it back. Slap me, baby, I’m happy. Slap me, beautiful, because I am alive.

Good day.",4.15
Nillerzzzzz,"This one awoke Raul’s senses like Adriana Lima crossing the street in a onesie - but it’s still a onesie. Adriana in a skin tight pencil skirt this is not. It’s just too thin and not robust like John Goodman as Big Dan Teague.

See you in the funny papers!",4.15
Nillerzzzzz,"Poured pitch black with absolutely no head. At the nose is heavy vanilla, fragrance is sweet and delectable. Hard to pick up the bourbon but good nonetheless.

Then upon tasting, very heavy bourbon. Almost overwhelming and unbalanced. The vanilla is faint at first but as the more sips I take, the heavy sweet vanilla character starts to build. Faint marshmallow and vanilla bean ice cream. But I don’t know...for the hype, I kinda expected a little more sweetness (talking liquid dessert) from the vanilla and maybe less booze.

Mouthfeel more medium bodied; not super full and thick but still some richness from the flavors.

Overall: great beer! Been one of those beers I’ve wanted to try for quite a while. I would always be happy to drink this again and even make it to the next release if I could. But I admit, it was a little over hyped. I guess I had my expectations way high.",4.43
Keene Idea,"Not sure why people feel the need to write reviews along the lines of ""it's an old style not fit for today's trends"".......it was brewed to be a piney, bitter, and malty beer and it's damn well crafted. If you were into trendy scotch drinks and were handed a glass of Louis XIII Cognac, would you poo-poo it for being different? Old school west coast IPA's exist for a reason, and they have certain qualities that make them different from the trendier new england style. This beer is a fantastic brew, with pine and malt flavors bursting onto the scene in a way you just don't find with most beers made elsewhere. When you take a sip, you just know it is a well crafted, and balanced brew.",4.44
Keene Idea,"No. No, no, no. I can't understand how everyone takes this well-balanced yet boring double IPA and elevates it to a godly status. It's fine, but the flavors, scent, and mouthfeel stop there. As a California born dude, I above all want to champion our beers. This is fine, but it's just not the champ.",3.75
Keene Idea,"Many reviews talk about the perfect balance between malt and hops displayed by this beer. They're not wrong. This beer has seen the tightrope strung across the canyon of drinkability and confidently trod the cord, using malt and hops as its balance beam while declining to use any of the 2020s' juiciness for a safety net.

Make no mistake, this is a bitter beer. It demands an experienced drinker's palate, but rewards the garnered experience of a craft beer drinker with a beer that displays subtle citrus notes, a strong yet not overbearing malt backbone and a hoppy, piney, resinous kick that unashamedly proclaims its double IPA genes.

In reality, this is an anachronism in 2022. It recalls the IBU wars of 15 years ago, but remains relevant because, at the end of the day, it's a damn good beer

Miami Madness,"2021 vintage

My first review of 2022! Yet another beer from my trade with merpunk1. This one is the highest rated Fruited Kettle Sour on BA, though it’s brewed more in the Berliner Weisse style, but whatever. It’s also currently sitting at #105 overall here, but I’m sure that’ll change soon given all the site updates as of late. Let’s pop this open

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

I really like what the guava does to this one in the nose, adding a nice funk. I’m picking up on aromas of overripe mango, funky guava, lemon juice, crackery malt, and light passion fruit

It’s even better in taste, still feeling unique in a world where this kind of thing is quite common. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon juice, funky guava, mango sorbet, crackery malt, passion fruit, and light orange juice. The swallow brings notes of tart passion fruit, orange juice, tart guava, apple skin, and pineapple

A light medium body pairs with aggressive tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and brisk beer. Finishes mostly dry and very tart

This is really good stuff, definitely worth trading for. I gotta get my hands on more of these J. Wakefield Berliners",4.33
Miami Madness,"Bottle pour at Other Half Finger Lakes in Bloomfield, NY.

This smells like lemon, lactic acid, sweet mango, guava, passionfruit, and citrusy funk.

This was probably earth shattering 5-6 years ago, when nothing like this existed. As it exists now, it's just a pleasantly tart fruited berliner with a semi-restrained fruit character, at least compared with the smoothie overload most breweries are doing these days. It's very drinkable, and you could easily see taking down a whole bottle of it if you so needed to.

This is light bodied, crisp, clean, and pleasantly sour on the finish, with a very nice drinkability.

This is most certainly overhyped, but it's still a well done and enjoyable beer through and through.",4.24
Miami Madness,"Pours a OJ. Nose of mango, guava, passion fruit. Taste follows - excellent fruit. Feel is medium with medium carb. Overall - it lives to what it says it is. Do not think it is complex",4.38
Miami Madness,"This is the best Berliner I've ever tasted, although this is coming from someone who doesn't really love Berliners. Bright color and outstanding fruit flavor, the guava really shines through. The best part is the finish though, it's perfect. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too dry. Just perfect.",4.41

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Nice light fluffy pale ale. I love this line of pale ales in general, with the DDH being the best variant. Maybe due to having the DDH version first, I really expected too much of this. Full disclosure, this is very good. One of the best pale ales I've had, and packed with a lot of flavor for a relatively smaller ABV, and I do love galaxy hops - but this doesn't stand up to the DDH Fort Point.",4.27
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Canned 10/05/20. Dark yellow, big head of fluffy white foam. Sweet smell of citrus and tropical fruits. Soft mouthfeel.

Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Pours a hazy orange with thick, fluffy head.

Smell is juicy and clean with notes of mango, pineapple, oranges and orange sorbet.

Taste is juicy and soft with notes of mango, peach, pineapple, citrus and a floral hint. Soft, but distinct bitterness and remarkable balance. Some sweetness on the finish.

Mouthfeel is perfect, soft, pillowy and well carbonated.

Overall, a truly outstanding beer, regardless of it being an APA or IPA.",4.72
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"Looks and smells gorgeous. Lots of citrus and tropical flavors on the nose. The mouthfeel is also good though the taste flavors are more on the grapefruit than citrus side. Personally, I liked it because it does make for a more balanced and complex beer.

I was happy to have this over sunset at a brewery. It just lacked something to make it a memorable beer. The dry hopping with Galaxy was pretty good but could be better. You could tell that the base beer (Fort Point) was awesome and saved the day.",4.33
Fort Point Pale Ale - Galaxy Dry Hopped,"L: Hazy yellow with a thick head and great lacing.

S: Pine resin, a touch of cheese, diesel, pineapple, juicy fruit. A candylike malt aroma as well.

T: Mild bitterness, big juicy hop flavors of tropical fruit, peach, and pine. The malt has a candylike flavor that reinforces the hop flavors.

F: Medium/full body, lowish carb, very Lush.

Overall: A really good beer that is just a little short of being great due to some off notes from the hops. I get a bit of staleness that is not due to the beers age (canned two weeks ago), but other than that it is really great.",3.96

Feels medium body, soft carbonation and juicy with little to no bitterness.

Overall really excellent. Glad I could pick some up!

I don't always knock points for style guidelines but I did here. Sure it's great and that's how they do things at Trillium but I like pale ales to be clear and crisp. It really should be qualified as a NE IPA but the brewery calls it a pale ale. I suppose the base beer without the double dry hop might be a little crisper, but still...",4.35

Triple Sunshine,"Canned 11/08/21. Let sit out for 15 minutes , before opening.

Lightly hazy orangey-gold, with about 1.5 fingers of pale orangey-tan head. Leaves behind about 1.25"" of 1/3 coverage streaky & spotty lacing, and a thin surface sheet, with a small mound of foam in the center.

Smell is light candied orange rind, a vague mix of fresh citrus, a bit of light pine, and some fresh-biscuit malt aroma .

Taste is a sweet orange rind flavor, but that of freshly-peeled orange rind that's been sweetened, rather that the usual dried /cooked[i.e., like marmalade] flavor. As such, it's also a bit sweeter than the usual too. Near finish, there's some faint pine, plus a touch of cooked sweet onion flavor (rather than the usual raw green onion). Very slight bitterness adds some balance towards finish, and lingers beyond. Brief, slight bread crust appears just as the liquid disappears.

Feel is heavy-side-of-medium, which actually seems lighter I would expect, given the aroma,taste, and abv. Slight drying effect after finish. A light internal warming feeling shows up after two or three sips, but no alcohol heat on the palate, or at the back of the throat.

Overall, pretty good. Better than all but one TIPA that I've had* . A little sweeter than I prefer, but not TOO much. Dangerously easy-drinking. That said, other than as an abv delivery device, (if you want that) I still don't see anything to recommend it over the DIPA, or normal version. All-in-all, a pleasant experience, though I prefer normal Sip just a tad more. :)

On the palate, lots of citrus and tropical fruit balanced by a solid malt backbone. Very full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel due to the moderate carbonation.

Feel... Suck a thick fullness with the carbonation making it not appear sweet in the back. Excellent.
Overall...This is very good just not the sort i seek out, so my bias is somewhat inherent in the review I suppose. Clearly that bias reflects somewhat in the score but ""Whata You gonna do"". I don't gamble on triple IPAs too much but this was worth it, and the caliber of brewery truly pulled my hand towards the purchase.",4.28

Triple Sunshine,"pours a lightly hazy golden with white head. That familiar Sunshine nose of Mango, Peach, some papaya as well. Honey sweetness, papaya, honeydew melon, some residual resinous bitterness. You can definitely feel the heat which is quite fusel. It's like an underpinning of some vodka or something, so it really has the taste of booze soaked fruit. A bit astringent on the finish. I think beer of this alcoholic magnitude should show the booze (so people aren't pretending how alcoholic this is), this does, but it does detract from the overall experience.",4.01

On tasting, bam!! Big grapefruit, pineapple and other mixed fruit flavors. Solid malt base adds a sweetness. Warming from the abv.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a sweet warm citrus bitterness, grapefruit leading the way.

JJJuiceee Machine,"From a 16oz can, dated 08/11/22. Space juice. Served in a spiegelau IPA glass.

Pours a thoroughly opaque, murky mango colour with a finger or so of super-soft, sudsy head. Retention is quite good, leaving a sudsy cap and a tattered blanket of foamy lacing.

Nose is unexpectedly quite feeble. Subtle aroma of that signature TH peachy-bubblegum-yeasty thing but too faint to say much more than that.

Taste follows the nose inasmuch as it isn’t as intense as I expected - which isn’t entirely a bad thing. Tasting fleshy peach, tangerine peel and a shit-ton of macerated bitter green tree leaves. The usual, expected supporting notes of mango, grapefruit juice, papaya and sticky pineapple.

Feel is… this can is, what, nearly two weeks old and the hop-onslaught is still so intense that it no-shit made my throat constrict! I actually took a moment to wonder which of my neighbours was most likely to have an epi-pen. Aside from that, it’s soft and juicy, medium bodied and brightly carbonated. Dry, sticky lips.

Overall, aside from the epic hop-burn, it’s not as crazy as I might have expected - which, again, aside from the price, isn’t entirely a bad thing. Hey! what do you know, this is the 103rd Tree House beer I’ve reviewed. Point being: this one is virtually indistinguishable from probably 90% of the other TH NEIPA’s I’ve had.

Served in a tulip

Cloudy yellow ochre appearance. The turbid looking body was topped by a small, creamy, bright white crown that slowly transformed into a thin dollop of froth. Streaky, drippy lacing coated the glass and stuck around until the drink’s end.

The aroma was impressive. Really fruity and bold. Honeydew melon notes were most prominent. Peach and apricot also came through strong. Good dose of sticky mango too. Nice citrus presence as well. Juicy orange notes stuck out. After the head died down, the dry, chalky, proprietary Tree House yeast character appeared.

The flavor profile was very solid. Big honeydew melon presence up front. Loads of ripe peach too. Citrus notes took over mid palate. Nice melding of sweet, juicy orange and tangy tangerine. White grapefruit appeared on the back end. Pithy, bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes rounded things out in the finish.

Excellent smooth, creamy, fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a fine, zippy effervescence that turned frothy and slick on the palate.

Like the original Juice Machine, this beer was super fruity and bright up front but quite pithy and bitter on the finish. Although I really enjoyed it, there are many Tree House IPAs that are better.",4.4

Taste is cinnamon first, and all else second. Milk chocolate is definitely there. Some coffee bitterness. Might be a hint of syrupy sweetness.

Sunday Brunch,"-Thanks to Stephanie (Kane)
- Imperial Milk Stout brewed with Rook Coffee, maple, and cinnamon.

A: Beautiful cascading effect with a dark tan head that is creamy and dense, standing a true two inches. The exiting pour was coffee colored, thick and viscose as it slurps from the bottle. Strong lasting coverage. Lots of micro-bubbly activity.

S: Burnt molasses, and chocolate. Dark sweet fruit, plums, sugary figs outlines. Sweet caramel and milky vanilla highlights. The maple syrup is rich and sweet, as well with evident hints of cinnamon spicing. Sweet initially, rich chocolate and marshmallow with cocoa. Things progressively move towards a smooth roastiness of cold coffee, caramel, and milky vanilla highlights.

T: Sweet dark fruit, particularly figs and plums with a smooth campfire minerality for flavor. The maple syrup plays a strong and sweet role in the profile. Silty coffee and caramel, with some molasses are strong supporters. Silty coffee texture and covering with sweet caramel and roastiness teasing the tongue and inner cheeks. Sweet roasty sweetness of chocolate and coffee with vanilla and maple syrup highlights really define the flavor profile.

M: Silty smooth texture on the mouthful with a equally smooth silty mouthful contribute and are equally as impressive.

O: The syrup backing brings sweetness and depth, while the cinnamon spicing has a nice finishing and complimentary touch. Outstanding flavor and texture. Everything blends so beautifully together its almost unreal. Sweet milky-vanilla with maple syrup and a silty texture leads to an outstanding drinkability that is exceptionally smooth and extraordinary.",4.5
Sunday Brunch,"Appearance - The beer poured an oily black color with a tan colored head and lacing left behind.

Smell - to put it simply, it smells like cinnamon toast. They were definite bread notes.

Taste - This tasted like cinnamon toast. They were definite bready notes with spice with just a touch of maple sweetness. The cinnamon was nicely balanced and not oppressive. In the back, it leaned more towards bitter coffee as the sweetness faded.

Mouthfeel - Being a porter, it was a little less clingy than a stout with less tendency to coat the mouth. It was still able to linger for a while b

Overall - This was great. It was not as heavy as a dessert stout.",4.59
Mexican Brunch,"Taking brunch south of the boarder, Kane Brewing looks to chili peppers, cinnamon and cocoa to give a decidedly Mexican twist to their imperial milk porter.

Mexican Brunch kicks off with a very dark brown pour and a frothy cap that fades rather quickly. As a scent of coffee rises first, a quick followup of syrup, chocolate, nuttiness and spice ensure a complex and enticing scent. Fully malted and sweet on the tongue, high impressions of chocolate, caramel, maple, toffee and vanilla play out in hot chocolate fashion in its early impressions.

As the flavors start to unfold, the middle palate holds onto its milky sweetness while the strong taste of coffee sets an earthy, nutty and roasty tone. Cinnamon and chilies mingle next for a sense of balance for the sweetness and to complement the coffee spice. Woodsy, earthy and toasty, the beer trails into a kahlua-like finish with balance and contrast in taste.

Full bodied and soothing on the finish, the beer finishes both spicy and calmly with the milk sugars and maple rounding out the gradual simmer of peppers into a warming afterglow of a Mexican inspired, alcoholic cappuccino.",4.24

M- medium body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky, velvety warming finish

O- all of the adjuncts work harmoniously with the milk sugars providing a perfect mouthfeel, outstanding",4.55
Mexican Brunch,"Appearance - The poured a murky black color with a dark tan head.

Smell - The nose was rich sweet chocolate. It may have been a chocolate maple combination.

Taste - Chocolate really stood out in the initial taste. It brought to mind chocolate cola. There were also notes of coffee, maple, and a touch of cinnamon. I knew this was not Mexican Cake, but I expected more heat from the chilies. The rest of the profile was well balanced.

Mouthfeel - The feel was slick with sweetness and modest carbonation.

Overall - I thought the beer was tasty, but I expected a bit more. Mainly, it lacked spice.",4.31
Black Tuesday,"From the 750 ml bottle in a snifter via Bluejacket74! Many thanks for this beast!
This monster pours a dark brownish black with a moderate head of light brown
foam that settles to a thick ring that dissipates to a thin ring with no lacing....but
give it a swirl and this one has some nice legs! Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark roasted
goodness, dark bakers chocolate, dark coffee, raisins, and astringent booze notes.
Flavors nail it! Dark bakers chocolate in bathed in rich bourbon, vanilla, oak, rich
char, dark berry notes of blackberry and raspberry, brewers licorice, and dark bread.
Excellent mouth feel for such a beast-----smooth, rich, coating, full body, light
carbonation with subtle lift, and a warming, bourbon forward, bitter roasted
malt finish that is medium dry.

Overall-----phew! What a brew!

Cheers",4.59
Black Tuesday,"2013 in 2022. 8 plus years and zero signs of oxidation. Very dark brown. Nose has light cinnamon behind big bourbon. Super boozy, notes of chocolate and molasses. Big body and medium carbonation with tongue numbing alcohol. Dream ale.",4.72
Black Tuesday,"Received this beauty from Dimidiata in an LIF connected to NBS BIF #14 - and she wasn't even part of that BIF!
Poured into a stout snifter the color of black coffee while being poured, looked onyx black with enticing looking light brown foam *trying* to form a head but failing, leaving a ring of foam around the edge.
The aroma is amazing, and my sense of smell is poor. Bourbon soaked oak, figs or prunes, molasses, leather all roll up into one delectable aroma, though from the description, I wouldn't have thought so. (Leather? Huh)
The taste is somehow sublime and over the top. Sublime in layers, the fig and/or prune flavor rises and falls through the chocolate and coffee and char that swirl in, all of which are supplanted by a powerful bourbon laced malty wonderful that is the body of this beer. At 19.5% ABV I was expecting heat from the raw alcohol, but that aspect is all but gone.
The feel is definately viscous, and rightfully so. Almost overly so. Just a bit. But that's a tiny quibble.
OA, Wow, really tasty.",4.96
Black Tuesday,"750 ml bottle, 2021 vintage, bottled 09/13/21, 18.9% ABV. Served in a Black Tuesday chalice, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head that stuck around a little bit. There's a decent amount of lacing. Aroma is strong, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, molasses, figs, dark chocolate, cream, roasted malt and some licorice. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some burnt/charred malt, oak, booze, earthy, dark bread and coffee flavors. There's a lot going on with this brew! Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and syrupy with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Has a boozy kick but it's still pretty drinkable for being that strong. Some more age wouldn't hurt this brew at all. I thought this was a pretty good imperial stout, definitely worth trying if you're into big barrel aged imperial stouts!",4.59
Black Tuesday,"Bottle received in Bif13 from @colts9016

Brewers Notes: Our infamous Black Tuesday is an imperial stout aged in bourbon barrels for over a year. Rich caramel, toasted malt, vanilla, burnt wood and anise are just a few of the many flavors in this rich, decadent imperial stout.

2020: 19.3% ABV

Good beer , thanks Jammin!!",4.55
Black Tuesday,"Pours close to jet black, small cap of tan head that settles to a thin ring; streaks of ruby when held up to light. Nose has huge notes of leather, molasses, and tobacco; bourbon and barrel notes come secondary as it warms, along with a bit of dark fruit. Taste is super complex, but definitely reflects the aroma - lots of leather, hearty, salty, iron-rich blackstrap molasses, Australian licorice; as it warms, more heat from the barrel, vanilla, char. Mouthfeel is very full, but with a small punch of small carbonation. Despite the warming heat, it hides its alcohol very well. Overall, definitely worth its reputation.",4.7

It’s truly perfect. The epitome of the craft. This is craft beer. More will come from this…I have the 2014+ vintages",4.63
Black Tuesday,"Definitely one of those beers i've waited a long time to get. Found it in a 16 oz can. I've had So Happens it's Tuesday, which I loved, but this is my first of the original. Maybe $25 was too much, maybe not. We'll see. In any case it's the highest ABV of any beer i've ever tried. 17% was the highest I've sampled, but this knocks that back a couple points. I've got a 2020 bottle. Poured out into a snifter, half inch head bubbled up and licked the sides of the glass, receding into a thin collar of beige. The smell is exquisite. That's a strong word, i know, but i think it deserves that descriptor. It's full and strong, bourbon and licorice and fig, that stings the back of the nose as it goes in. 5 on the smell. Love it. Let's sip now, Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, licorice, fig, smoke, char, leather, damn, this is very comparable to Bourbon County Stout. This has been barrel aged for a year, and it sure picks up that bourbon flavor, filling the crevices of my mouth in such a delightful way. I had Indian food for dinner, and I love the layers Indian has, it seems to fill up every bit of my palate. This beer is the same way, it has a way of overcoming and washing over my tastebuds, allowing me to pick up on lots of layers of flavor. It's also like Indian because it's got a spiciness to it, that tickles my tongue and overwhelms me. There is light carbonation, and a medium mouthfeel, not too thick and not too thin. Overall I'm very impressed with this and i'm glad I bought two cans of it. This is the beer of a mature drinker. This is the beer of a wise man. This is the beer of a guy who's well traveled. This is the beer of a guy who's got a financial plan. This is the beer of a man with an important job. This is the beer of a man who knows how to relax with class. This is the beer of a good father. This is the beer of a faithful husband. This is the beer of a youthful grandpa. This is getting my top ratings. What a way to celebrate Father's Day 2021!",5.0
Black Tuesday,This one is THICCC! Very dark and a strong boozy smell. Initial punch of booze and toffee up front and finishes nicely. This is a big one so definitely not on to tackle on your own!,4.24
Black Tuesday,Completely unreal thick. Had a 2016 cellared for 4 years. Chocolate and bourbon and a boozy but smooth element. Torquey at almost 20%. All the elements of a world class stout with chocolate and vanilla and tobacco. A dessert,4.72

Scaled Way Up,"No age on this one, filled in a growler on 3/12/20. I believe it's 3-4 weeks since brewing.

Pours a nearly completely opaque golden yellow straw with a finger of creamy head that dissipated rather quickly. Big nose of mango, dried peach, candied ruby grapefruit, cara cara orange, slight bubblegum, pineapple, over-ripened apricot and Portuguese sweet bread. Just bursting with a sweet candied tropical fruit aroma, love it. Tons of flavor on first sip, all the notes of the nose melded together well with an addition of over-ripe papaya, slight dankness, honeydew melon and a little bit of pine resin. I'm so glad I got a 64oz growler of this one! So good! Wonderful soft, slightly resin-y medium body but I kinda wish it had just a tiny bit more fullness. Medium- bitterness, medium drying, medium- prickly carbonation.. Today was my first time on jury duty and I'm glad I stopped by Trillium for this one, I can't think of a better brew to relax with after a long day.",4.56
Scaled Way Up,"On tap at Bayberry Beer Hall in RI, pours a murky hazed yellow, small white head that fades fast

The smell is incredible here, an overload of papaya, banana, pineapple, orange and mango, just the lightest hop bite to back it up

The taste is a bit of a letdown compared to the aroma but still awesome. I get piney, resinous hops, a light florality, very tropical

The feel is nice and prickly, pretty highly carbonated and drinks medium bodied

Some pretty amazing stuff right here, super easy drinking but still really interesting",4.41

Standard tropical hop aromas.
Standard tropical hop tastes. Some citrus and wine notes in there. Some dankness for good measure.
Good mouthfeel, but there’s a significant hop burn going down. I think they went too far with the dry-hopping. Instead of bitter taste they accentuated the throat burning effect.
To me an average to below-average hazy, in a giant sea of average hazies.
I’m shocked that it was rated this well actually. I can only attribute it to hazy hype and/or rewarding for pushing the limits.",3.55

There is zero subtly here, and yes I know the point is to scale things “way up”, but this literally hits just one hop-burn note. Disappointing for sure

It’s just another treehouse beer that you have to try to see how it compares. But for me, there was nothing standing out that i could really appreciate or even describe. Its very smooth drinking but to a fault in that it lacked any kind of bitter or pithy punch on the finish.",4.22
Alter Ego,"Now I think people fall into this Treehouse hype and believe me it is deserved. They make some of the best beers in the world. However, this is just a solid New England IPA. I have had things similar. Thick orange color with a fluffy head and bursting with citrus flavors. Where this separates itself is in its smooth drinkability. It goes down like an orange juice.",4.0
Alter Ego,"Pours an opaque dirty straw color with a half finger of head. The nose has notes of over-rippened tropical fruits with a hint of citrus. The flavor is the same over-rippened tropical fruitiness combined with a grainy quality. Like its less-evil twin Julius, the finish is pithy. Oddly enough, however, I think that Julius has a more potent bitterness.

The body is definitely hearty for the style.",4.18

Smell: Citrusy notes of orange, lemon and grapefruit complemented by hints of pineapple, white grapes and apricot.

Taste: Ripe tangerine and grapefruit paired with tropical mango and pineapple. The body is sweet and minimally zesty, the finish bitter and dry.

Feel: Full and juicy, almost creamy. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Great alteration of Julius with some added citrusy freshness rounding off the sweet base very nicely. Certainly one of the best sub 7% ABV IPAs out there which doesn’t have to shy away from its bigger siblings.",4.5

$15.20/4-pk at the brewery on 05/12/22

Notes via stream of consciousness: The label states that this is the ""twin brother to Julius"", and that it ""builds upon Julius with... Mosaic and Amarillo..."". A finger's width of off-white foam tops a murky golden colored body with an orange sheen. The head appears to be holding quite well so far. The aroma offers upsome sweetish malt, soft berries, and orange. The flavor is fuller with additional notes of mango, passionfruit, peach, lychee, floral blossoms, grass, pine, and earth. A median bitterness balances it and along with a little bit of ""hop bite"" leads to a dry finish with some fruit, pine, earth, and spice lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied but with a lot of extra proteins that makes it seem fluffier and somewhat fuller. It's gently crisp and then smooth. The head held up quite well and there are torn sheest of lace and craggy rings left throughout the glass. I actually like this better than Julius but that's probably just because Mosaic hops are my current favorite.

Alter Ego,"Canned 4/27/22. “You can call me Al” stamped on the bottom of the can

So this was literally canned fucking today. That’s wild to me, as fresh as Tree House can be. This is one I’ve somehow missed every time I take a trip out to the brewery, but I’m happy to finally get to it. Yet another TH beer in the top 250 as well. Let’s get into it

Pours a hazy pale gold with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

The nose shows a surprising amount of balance, but it makes sense considering it’s based on Julius. I’m picking up on aromas of juicy mango, peppery hops, apricot, doughy malt, orange juice, and papaya

It is similarly balanced in taste, feeling bright and juicy. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting tangerine zest, crackery malt, juicy mango, earthy hops, orange juice, and peach. The swallow brings notes of peppery hops, tangerine zest, crackery malt, papaya, gooseberry, and light orange zest

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a firm bitterness

Yet another killer NEIPA from Tree House. Better than Julius, but not quite as good as King Julius still. Maybe it’ll be even better when it’s not so fresh",4.46

Saint Lamvinus,"Bottle, RBESG 2005, Grand Tasting. Cloudy reddish colour with brownish tones. Intense barnyard and ""fruits of the forest"" aroma. Intensely sour flavour, lemons with notes of raspberries and blackcurrants. Overpowering and delightful at the same time.",4.11

S: Funky hay, red grape skins.
T: Deep flavour of red grapes. Some wood, tart finish.
F: Lively carbonation. Crisp.
O: Great showcase of grapes in a lambic.",4.46
Saint Lamvinus,"2019 Vintage - poured into a wine stem at 45°F.

Pours a bright, translucent ruby stone red, with half a finger of pinkish-white head forming, and then immediately settling to a thin collar. Simple, but very pretty.

Nose: Soft grainy base, with raw wheat and dusty grain silo, beneath a very bright, vibrant fruit layer. This isn't deep, saturated, sweet grape, but young, fresh, and juicy. Some underlying jammy notes of red currant, blackberry, raspberry, peak through, with a deeper red wine note coming in and out of focus. Some gooseberry, pear, and lemon notes lend brightness and fruity acidity atop a very restrained, young funk presence, with hay, stable, leather, wet oak, petrichor, grass, and topsoil.

Palate: Saint Lamvinus greets the palate with a mildly tart spark, paired perfectly with a thread of sweetness. I believe both the grain *and* the fruit are lending some sugars here. Bright, yet musty grape, with a touch of red berries, abd then the brighter notes emerge, showcasing lemon, gooseberry, white grape, and unripe stone fruit. With this, the tartness increasing, becoming fully dry, with high minerality opening the door for classic Cantillon funk - sea shells, salty air, old wet oak, hay, damp soil, and an almost brie/bloomy rind neutral musty note. Some significant oak tannins emerge, alongside a subtle, tonic-like bitterness. Tartness disappears, finishing with red wine cask, grape skin, and grapefruit pith.

Mouthfeel/Body: This seems to have found its sweet spot, with 7% ABV balancing between enough grain to lend presence, but not enough to advance from the background. Delicate and fluid, but enough body to lend a softness. Effervescence is extremely fine and gentle, but still fairly fizzy. Not puckering - tartness is kept in check, and allows for a progression of dryness. Balanced tannins.

Overall: A delicate, expressive, and definitively Cantillon Cantillon. The grape presence appears simple at first, but unfurls with some subtle but complex depth, pairing with just the right amount of complimentary funk. The subtle suggestion of sweetness is beautiful, and the lambic proceeds with these little ""chapters"" of flavour. Remarkably balanced and approachable, with an elegant simplicity.",4.47

Did get a nice coconut smell and taste but think the time on the bottle probably muted both of those a bit. The thing I didn't like as much was the roasty taste, which I guess might be the porter part, but could also be some darker coffee roasts.

Notorious Triple IPA,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pours a medium coppery amber with a two finger white head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, orange, mild mixed tropical fruit and pine;a touch of green onion. Flavor is lightly caramel malt, citrus and piney hops, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mixed tropical fruit and pine needles. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. So great to find an traditional triple IPA with real malt flavor, lots of fruit and pine and substantial bitterness in the finish. I was struck but the mild sweetness of this one, but with all the mixed fruit it fit perfectly. Some hotness, but plenty of flavor to cover the ABV well. Boneyard has always pleased with IPAs and I'm not sure why I've never seen this one in my area before. I'll be looking for it in the future. Excellent.",4.4
Notorious Triple IPA,"Look: Nearly clear rich orange with a reddish hue and the pour yields a thick pure white head that pillows up and slowly recedes, leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: I could smell it before I got close to the glass. Sweet orange, peach, strawberries, pine sap, cantaloupe, a little Cannabis, rich honey-like sweetness, ruby-red grapefruit, Hawaiian bread, tangerine, and an ever-so-slight ethanol waft
Taste: Whoa. A huge rush of mixed citrus fruits storm onto the palate as honey-like sweetness and berries start to mix in. Pine and dank herb appear from time to time and malt sweetness is ever-present and closes with a big hop bite and alcohol heat
Mouthfeel: Full, slick, slightly cloying but far from palate-taxing, and decently dry on the finish along with some alcohol heat
Overall: This is a big-time beer and a good one at that. This was my first time with this beer in years and was pumped when I saw they had finally canned it (or packaged it at all) but glad it’s not around often as it’s a huge Triple IPA and it shows.

32oz growler served in a SIP Fest 2020 snulip. Bought it yesterday at Thirsty Hop. I've had this several times before, but the first time in a situation where I could sit down and pay attention and write my thoughts.

Pours a clear light amber with a small head. Looks thick. Lots of fine slow carbonation. Smell is booze, pine, lemon. Might get a little honeysuckle.

Taste is a boozy blast, lemon and citrus for sure, so much resin and pine, kind of dancing around -- first I taste this, then that then it switches again. Hard bitter finish. Something kind of tropical in there, too.

Mouthfeel is medium and surprisingly dry. Overall...this is really good. Dangerously easy to drink. I knew it was really good. It's nice to pay attention to it. I consider this a prime example of west coast style TIPA.",4.22
Notorious Triple IPA,"Clear deep gold with a touch of red. One finger of dense cream color head that forms rings of lace as the level drops.
Smell is orange green dank and rich malt.
Taste is bold floral and fruity hops with a bit of dankness. Good strong bready malt support.
Mouthfeel is full with good carbonation. The finish is mildly dry and somewhat bitter.
Overall a tasty triple ipa.",4.4
Black Gold,"Not getting much bourbon, but the barrel wood is really coming through. At first it seemed a tad bitter or tannic, but ten minutes or so of breathing mellowed that.
Very easy to drink. Solid all around. Thirty minutes out, there’s more sweetness and a bit more bourbon vibe. The base stout is,
for lack of better description and palate, a savory type, not sweet or chocolatey. Buy it if you see it.",4.53
Black Gold,"Very excited about this one. Poured from fridge temp. Pours motor oil black with almost no head. It looks thick!

Nose: Beautiful. Roasted malts and dark fruit jump out immediately. The bourbon is definitely there, adding nice vanilla and caramel notes. Chocolate notes come through nicely. The nose is generally sweet, with no detectable bitterness. Molasses starts to get noticeable as it warms.

Taste: Wow. What a nice marriage of roasted malts and sweet bourbon notes. Dark chocolate, charred oak, toffee, vanilla, dark berries, raisins, dates, a touch of leather, earth, and brown sugar. This is just a fantastic barrel-aged stout. Each sip makes me want more.

Mouthfeel: Not the thickest stout in the world, but definitely creamy and silky. Just amazing. Overall, a huge winner in my books. I hope you track another down at some point.",4.49
Black Gold,"2020 vintage; consumed on 9/18/21

Pours an inky black body topped with over two fingers of fluffy, khaki-colored foam; decent head retention leaves paper-thin islands of cap, large, frothy collar, minimal-no lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings a soft touch of molasses upfront, carrying soft caramel creams into a steadily building oaky vanilla and eventually culminating with robust waves of raw cacao meeting oaky bourbon.

Taste opens with bittersweet cocoa tinged with toasted oak barrel and residual bourbon characteristics, though the malt is central, peaking over the mid-palate with the purest, flaky roast sensations cooly revealing layer upon layer of oily, raw cacao, burnt almond, and evocative dark chocolate.

Mouthfeel shows a medium-light body, silkily textured and, in tune with a soft, prickly carbonation, sporting mild gritty accents into the mid-palate; suggestions of distant char and balanced booziness enhance over the back end, eventually leveling out to a dry roast along the palate's finish.

Chocolate, malted chocolate, dragged from the most evocative expanses of its malt profile and kissed with a softly integrated bourbon implicating a doting heat to further accentuate the already resonant roast; a classic sipper, its quintessence on full display.",4.25

Appearance: 5 - blacky black but a bit thin at the edges. The head remains as a thin halo.

Nose: 4 - I'm not getting much barrel here. Smells like a straight up imperial stout. Good thing I like those.

Taste: 5 - yeah, definitely more barrel here. This tastes like Bourbon County's little cousin who's a bit rough around the edges. Just a tad bitter.

Mouth: 5 - silky smooth. Slightly thick, but like velvet going down.

Overall: 5 - really world class. My only gripe is the slight bitterness

Cheers!",4.76
Black Gold,"This one pours a fairly dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like roasted malt, spicy oak, dark chocolate, coffee, tobacco, and vanilla.

This is definitely old school in execution - there's lots of roast and spice here. There's a big barrel character - oak char, vanilla, spicy bourbon - it feels like something that was in barrels a decently long time. There's some dark fruit and lots of dark chocolate, along with a cigar-like bitterness.

This is medium bodied, not quite as thin as most Central Waters, with a *slightly* prickly carbonation to it. If the carbonation was dropped a smidgen, the mouthfeel would be much better.

There's a lot to love about this one - it's a good idea to revisit what barrel aged stouts used to be.",4.11
Black Gold,"Appearance - The beer poured a fuzzy black color with a mocha colored head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was malty bourbon. The booze does not dominate. There was a nice malty presence.

Taste - this was like barrel aged chocolate malt. The profile was well balanced. It was like chocolate malt, but it was not too boozy. Darker chocolate emerged at the finish.

Mouthfeel - The lower carbonation allowed chocolate to linger.

Overall - The chocolatey goodness lingered nicely.",4.5
Black Gold,"Striking gold isn't easy. Once you find it once, you gotta keep going back time after time. And that's what Central Waters Brewing does with their bourbon barrel aged American Double Stout. Except, its black gold.

And the beer of that exact namesake pours with the consistency of used motor oil, black and inky upon the pour, a patient froth begins to release. The draw of caramelized char, coffee, chocolate, nuttiness and wonderfully burnt cream is too much for the nose to resist. In similar form the initial taste is lush with molasses, brown sugar and cream in suggestive of roasted marshmallows.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, a strong sense of coffee, cocoa and roasted walnut overcomes the sweetness and begins to usher in the bourbon complexities with charred oak, vanilla, coconut, cherry and caramelized whisky spice. Trending moderately bitter, the late palate highlights a walnut character with coffee-like bitterness although all are probably hop-derived.

Full bodied and quite decadent overall, the rich and chewy ale never promotes cloying textures, but finishes long and fat with malt flavor and mouthfeel. An extended warmth of peppery whisky and a simmering bourbon heat resonates slightly past the char and the beer's nearly port-like fruitiness.",4.4
Black Gold,"Pours a deep black with more than head than expected, thicker than I remember last year Lots of nice barrel on both nose and taste. Very smooth and no heat. Love this one and will seek it out every year.",4.52
Beyond Good And Evil,"2018 vintage on tap. Tan head. Black color (dark brown).

Smooth, silky, light roast, light heat. Awesome bourbon and fudge notes. The maple adds a nice light sweetness that goes well with the heat and roast from the barrels. Toasted marshmallow. Chocolate. Full bodied, great feel. Very surprised with how much I liked this as I haven’t enjoyed hill stouts in the past.",4.5
Beyond Good And Evil,"L -- Jet black in the glass with a surprisingly robust two finger head produced with aerated pour. Hard to believe this has been bottle conditioning for a year and a half
S -- Waves of rich milk chocolate, wet bourbon barrel, prune, fig, chocolate covered cherries, vanilla, maple, and light smoke. Smells like a pastry stout without being a pastry stout
T -- Incredible how much of a difference 18 months of barrel aging makes over the usual 10-12. The bourbon barrel presence is heavy here -- both in the notes of oak from the barrel itself but also the boozy bourbon heat. Very rich, mapley base stout that has both an espresso/dark chocolate character and a sweet fudginess. The bourbon is just a hair on the hot side
F -- Big mouthfeel, medium- carb. Lasting, sweet finish. Oily and slick, less velvety than expected
O -- One of the best barrel aged stouts I've had. Patience is the name of game when it comes to barrel aging, and Hill Farmstead has it in spades. Very pricey @$25/17 oz, but it's worth it

Beyond Good And Evil,"Finally trying this one, march 28 2021, bottled 10-3-18. For me the feel is just outstanding, full and creamy and smooth, approaching syrupy, but still with enough carbonation to keep it drinkable. It’s Hill Farmstead, of course the feel is going to be exceptional. The aroma is strangely mild but the flavor explodes with maple syrup and whiskey notes and has to be the sweetest of any HF beer I can recall. Just lean enough to stay in balance.

Crack of the can is big pineapples, oranges, some grass and a hint of melon and peaches.

Getting citrus peel in the taste-very nice bitterness-along with some of the aforementioned fruits. Well balanced taste.

Soft, full-bodied mouthfeel. Nice bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

Wonderful beer to experience. Green or Gggreennn? Tough call to make...",4.74
Gggreennn!,"TGIG. Tree House makes some funky fruity stuff that so far I've had some difficulty ""appreciating"". Just had a few bad sips of one such bitter fruit bomb. Then switched to GGGreennn!

Look: Pours a hazy, slightly muddy yellow with a stable foamy head that leaves a good amount of lacing. A few floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh citrus fruits and pineapple. Green and a bit dank.

Taste: Green hops and fresh fruits. Citrusy (lemon and orange) and tropical (pineapple and guava). Some hints of sweetness and a zesty, very bitter finish.

Feel: Juicy and quite crushable. Medium carbonation and some sharp notes.

Overall: As much as I prefer Very Green over Green, I prefer Very Gggreennn over Gggreennn. Sounds confusing, but this one tastes just a bit too green for me. It's still a very nice brew with the typical Tree House characteristics.",4.31

Gggreennn!,"I wish I had both Very Green and this and could go back and forth to compare. Very Green is probably my most favorite beer I’ve ever had. The flavors, the aroma, all of it. This is every bit what Very Green was from what I remember. I can’t say if it’s more flavorful or not, I just don’t have the reference point. All that being said, hot damn I love this beer. So dynamic. Juice slams you in face on the initial sip and then it fades to a piney after taste. You really kinda hit both NEIPA and West Coast styles all in one sip. Their is a slight difference when drank from the can and a glass. The can lip seems to fizz up the beer and almost hides some of that juice at the start. From the glass it’s so pronounced and smooth. The “green” beers are heaven, and the TreeHouse concept of “maxing them out” is a wonderful idea. It’s like heavy legs day at the gym. How much can I really do? Can not wait for another excuse to be in Western, Mass.",4.68
Gggreennn!,"Cloudy OJ color with three fingers of dense, yellowed head. Great retention and soapy lacing.

Big pineapple and Orange Julius in the nose. A hint of savory Italian herbs below.

Some of the pineapple carries over to the taste, but there’s a lot more lime, white pepper and pithy bitterness here. A little orange juice peaks out under the pith every once in a while in the aftertaste.

Full bodied and slick with strong carbonation.

Not bad, but the lime and pith combo is a touch too strong to my preferences.",3.95

Gggreennn!,"Pours an opaque OJ yellow, frothy 1.5"" white head with moderate retention and good lacing. Nose is mostly tropical - papaya and passionfruit juice, along with spent grain. A hint of spicy alcohol as well as it warms. Initially, the taste answers the question of what adding more Sunny D to a glass of Sunny D would taste like. The answer is Sunny D. It's OJ without the tartness, sweet yet somehow watered down at the same time. Flat, one-note sweetness. On the finish, however, it does develop some - hints of hop spice, a little resin here, a little pine there. White and black pepper. Mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly soft and full. Was hoping for more resinous punch here given the reviews, but any ""greenness"" takes a backseat.",4.04
Gggreennn!,"Canned 12/23/21. Green indeed. Earthy, piney, grassy, lime peel, grapefruit pithy. Super dry. I assumed this was a juice bomb based on the haze but this is anything but. New school look with old school flavor.",4.27
Gggreennn!,"So i chugged 3 of these, and they smelled and tasted foul, hence the need for a funnel. I also didn’t love how it felt, so I was originally thinking 2 there. It did look amazing in the funnel, so there is the 5. Then I blew chunks all over my date, and that made me feel like a 1. So overall I give it a 2, because it was funny to see all the chunks in my girl’s hair.

I get notes of more citrus, dry, slightly grassy with loads of grapefruit. End of more citrus and mango. Very good. Body is light with ample carbonation. Prickly and lively on the palate and goes down dry and filmy. Bone dry going down with a long, lingering finish.

Chocolate Rain,"2017 vintage

It’s been a while, but I’m back with another BIF beer from @Eziel! This guy supplied me with some truly crazy stuff, and I’m hyped to try this one out. I really liked the raspberry cobbler Black Tuesday variant, so I have high hopes for this one too. Let’s dive into it

Pours a surprisingly light muddy brown with a finger of tan head that quickly fades to nothing and leaves no lacing

The nose here is quite pungent, perhaps an artifact of 5 year old vanilla beans and cacao nibs. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark chocolate, vanilla bean, heavily roasted coffee, hot bourbon, light toasted oak, and molasses

Whereas the nose was charmingly pungent, the taste is a bit sharp and aggressive. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting hot bourbon, burnt coffee, vanilla bean, dark chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, and molasses. The swallow brings notes of hot bourbon, toasted oak, vanilla bean, cacao nibs, black cherry, burnt coffee, toasted oak, and caramel

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp and boozy (duh) beer. Finishes dry but with a serious alcoholic heat

Damn, I don't know if it was the age, but I really did not vibe with this one. It's hard to say if it was once well constructed, as it doesn't even really show a shell of what it used to be, save for the aroma. Hopefully the Black Tuesday Reserve he sent me is much better",3.8

Pours a very dark brown. 1 finger off white head. For the ABV, the retention is good. The head dissipates to a ring around the edge of the glass. There's some decent carbonation rising in the glass that makes the ring swirl about. No lacing on the glass.
The nose is a sweet toffee aroma from the barrels. I do get a chocolate and vanilla undertone.
Taste - Like the nose tons of toffee. The chocolate is really muted. I don't know if it would be stronger fresh. The chocolate and vanilla are on the backside.
Very boozy, which isn't surprising. Even aged 4 years, very ""hot"". It isn't as thick as I was expecting.

Bourbon and vanilla are in one camp, and chocolate truffle in another during the sip. Still delicious, but want more integration.

Received from @beersnake1 in Bif15 , poured into a smog city brewing glass also from him. The #4 ranked barley wine on beer advocate is a double barrel aged barley wine


Brewers Notes: A blend of two different Double Barrel-Aged Barleywines. The first Barleywine was aged in a Woodford Reserve Malt Whiskey barrel for over 20 months, then finished in a combination of Weller and Blanton Bourbon casks for close to a year. The second Barleywine was first aged in an Armagnac puncheon for close to two year, then finished in a blend of Heaven Hill Rye and Sazerac Rye casks. Each beer was cold-conditioned in stainless, and then blended together to create this Double Barrel-Aged Barleywine.


Dark , murky, muddy brown liquid capped by a thin taupe foam layer , quickly recedes to a taupe ring

Aroma is bourbon, raisins, toffee

Taste is bourbon soaked raisins, toffee, dark fruits ,

Mouthfeel is soft and fizzy , sweet , the 15.7 % abv is very well hidden

Great beer , another want ticked off my list courtesy of @beersnake1, thank you",4.53
Double Double Cask,"A: Pour an almost opaque yet still clear dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate chestnut brown + cola brown + garnet red + ruby red colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a small to medium sized patch of wispy very thin film covering approximately 25% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edge of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate to strong aromas of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + Rye over the top of slightly stronger than moderate aromas of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of toasted oak + vanilla.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of toasted + bready + caramel + toffee malts with a slightly stronger than moderate amounts of dark fruit (raisin + plum + cherry) + caramel + toffee sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of toasted oak + vanilla. Finally there are moderate to strong flavors of Armagnac/Brandy + Bourbon + spicy Rye. No perceptible hop flavor is present and the booziness along with spiciness from the rye linger well through the finish.

M: Full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with slightly heavier than moderate amounts of alcohol warming in the finish.

O: Drinks quite easily considering how big/strong ABV and intense this beer is and the alcohol is well hidden other than the warming feeling. Very enjoyable with lots of complexity to the flavors and aromas with tons of contribution from the different barrel treatments.",4.51

Taste is unbelievably complex, with layers of roasted grain, whiskey and top notch cognac. Not overly sweet, medium dry, very clean finish, not a fault anywhere. This could easily go with any steak in 5-star restaurant or as an after-dinner finish with the highest quality cheeses, fruits and Belgium chocolate.",4.64
Double Double Cask,"Appearance: Pours a murky burnt caramel color that is clear enough if you look at it carefully; the one finger beige head fades to a ringlet and archipelago while leaving a few spots behind

Smell: The Armagnac puncheon and Rye casks really show their influence on the aroma though there is Bourbon in the fold, as well; the expected Barleywine tones of caramel, raisin, spice cake and vanilla; there is a strong sweet cherry component, too

Taste: The brandied flavors of Armagnac hit the taste buds at the outset, with the cherry, raisin, caramel and spice cake flavors emerging; spicy Rye, vanilla and Bourbon tones emerge, in the middle, with the finish being sweet and boozy

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with low carbonation; considerable warmth in the gullet

Overall: A lot going on here, perhaps too much, as I don't think the Armagnac, Rye and Bourbon coalesce very well and I would prefer a bit more of a hop presence to balance out the sweet cherry tones - definitely extreme, though",4.19

EBB night 3, beer 4! The finale! It's quite funny to me how I planned for me and my buddy to drink these box beers together over 3 nights and made sure this one was the finale, pretty much right as al the beers were officially announced. I just wanted something huge to finish off with. Now, I'm drinking what climbed up to the 4th highest rated American Barleywine, and the 93rd highest rated beer overall on BA. That's absolutely wild for a fest-exclusive beer, and I couldn't be more excited to finally try this one. Let's get into it

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of light tan head that quickly fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

This is very boozy in the nose, quite sweet for an American expression if the style. I’m picking up on aromas of brown sugar, hot bourbon, raisin, sweet caramel, dark bread, and light vanilla

As I’m sipping this, I think it’s good, but not really as good as everyone else is making it out to be. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dates, molasses, brown sugar, earthy bourbon, vanilla, dark bread, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark cherry, earthy toffee, spicy whiskey, vanilla, light rye, raisin, and brown sugar

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and boozy beer. Finishes mostly dry from the booze

Yeah so this was good, but I don’t think it was anything near what it was hyped up to be. I don’t think it was masterfully blended or anything but I enjoyed it",4.28
Double Double Cask,"Can from the Extreme Beer Box. Pours an opaque dark brown with a finger of mocha head heat sticks around, boozy lacing, smell is bourbon, chewy dark toffee, dark/burnt caramel, fudge, dried dates, tootsie roll, hints of vanilla, wood, and dirt/mulch, taste is incredibly smooth bourbon, vanilla, toffee, caramel, chewy molasses cookies, hints of creme brûlée and maple syrup, feel is full bodied, velvety smooth, mouth coating. Bourbon candy. Extr-yams.",4.34
Double Double Cask,"Canned 1/18/2022. 2nd to last from the 2022 Extreme box. Dark mahogany and brown, dense appearance, no head. Aroma of dark fruit/plum/nougat/fig and bourbon/rye barrel. Taste is right in line. Equal parts of many different flavors, sweet, and strangely easy drinking for the ABV. Feel is full, carbonation medium low. Overall, this may be my favorite bourbon barrel aged barley wine since the disappearance of a BCBBABW. Or whatever the acronym was.",4.46
Double Double Cask,"The crowned glory of the Awesome Extreme Beer Box 2022!

Double Double Cask,"Poured from a can at fridge temp. Pours super dark brown - almost black. Very little head. Nose is just insane. Very nice Armagnac notes come through immediately. Super intense dark fruit. Super rich truffles, thick dark caramel, molasses, bourbon. The taste is absolutely crazy. Very very intense. Follows the nose very nicely. Rich toffee, chocolate, bourbon, Armagnac, figs, maple syrup, blackberries, red grapes, port, and a very slight roasted malts note. There is a very faint hint of pipe tobacco, but it's literally 1% of the taste. The best way to describe this is rich and robust. Sweet, but not cloying. The barrel influence is crazy. Very boozy, but not in a bad way. Mouthfeel is thick, but not really creamy. Overall, one of my favorite barleywines, and favorite beers, of all time.",4.86
Double Double Cask,"Look: Dark, syrupy with minimal to no head. Got some nice mahogany when holding up to light source.
Smell: Soy sauce. Boozy. Black licorice. Chewing tobacco (not dip…the good ol’ thick shredded chewing tobacco)

Taste: Chewing tobacco. Also getting some soy sauce and Robitussin cough syrup. Sweet and sticky. The booze is warm and comforting. As I worked through it, it started tasting more like a Cognac or Scotch.

Feel: Heavy body with medium low carbonation. Sticky.

Overall: In Winter with a fire and maybe Lord of the Rings on, this would be perfect.",4.03
Double Double Cask,"I enjoy sharing my extreme beer box contents with family & friends but this one, I set aside for myself only. Upon popping the top, the contents were eagerly awaiting release into a chalice. Dark, reddish brown color with with a thin head, it makes a somewhat boring appearance. It’s aroma promises some excitement, sweet & boozy with caramel, vanilla, maple & whiskey. It is sweet and, oh my, packed with flavor: brown sugar, caramel, vanilla & oak flavors, malt whiskey & rye. Silky smoot feel with low carbonation, no need for belching here. Mild mouth heat with more heat once it settles into the tummy. One of the best beers I’ve tasted, being selfish can sometimes be very rewarding.",4.69
Double Double Cask,Poured a deep brown color with an off white head on top. The smell of the beer has an abundant barrel aroma to it which is expected from something that's been aging in barrels for so long. The taste has a nice mixture of rich caramel and dark fruit notes.

Nice malty, bourbon-tinged aroma.

Complex flavor, mixing caramel, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and dark fruit.

Emperor Julius,"Pours a turbid orange color with an egg white colored head that is creamy and leaves thick lacing rings down the glass. Magnificent looking hazy, IMHO. The nose is rife with dank ripe oranges and mango, with some pineapple and melon as well.

The taste is focused on the ripe orange and mango flavors, with some melon and pineapple for kicks. There is zero discernible alcohol, quite impressive for an 8.8% ABV beer.

The mouthfeel features that trademark full, pillowy Tree House mouthfeel that keeps reeling you in for another sip. If you enjoy hazies (and I do), Tree House is your Holy Grail. World class stuff, IMHO.",4.5

A - Dark orange gold color with dense, soapy white lacing.

S - Very dank, juicy orange and mango totally dominate the nose (along with some pineapple). In fact, I could smell this beer from two feet away when I poured it!

T - Follows the nose, and nothing but juicy dankness from start to finish. Juicy and pithy orange, mango, fruit rind, pineapple, and passionfruit from start to finish. Finishes on the sweeter side with some underlying citrus bitterness.

M - Thick, pillowy soft, and chewy.

O - Maybe not a perfect 100 but it's high on the impressive list. Go get 'ya some.",4.41
Emperor Julius,"Ever think you've had too many IPA's and then you find one that makes you realize that you haven't tried everything worth having?

Yeah, this was one of those beers.

One of my friends went up there recently and brought down a bunch of their recent releases. All were solid, as was this, was it was a worthy iteration of the Julius family. Poured like orange juice, felt like orange, juice, and had possibly the best head and lacing that I've ever seen in a Tree House beer as it perfectly settled and left behind thick rings that nearly resembled a sheet. Quite a sight to behold as the sensory enjoyment easily bled over into the nose and taste. Loads of dewy forest, dank hops, apricot, stone fruit, turbid orange, and slick juice were found in both as the smell and flavor profile of this brew were one and the same. So smooth, so fun, and so easy to fall in love with, this had a nice body, hints of wheat in the taste, and went down *way* too easily with a bit bit of dankness and floral notes staying around in the aftertaste.

I have no idea how this was 8.8% ABV as this felt like fermented juice with some hops and a bit of tropical fruit and swamp water thrown in for fun. Dated 8/24 on the bottom of the can with ""IT IS YOUR DESTINY"" written above it, the Star Wars reference was fun, just like the rest of this outstanding brew. Use the force, or whatever it takes, to get your hands on this and thank Tree House for still killing it after all of these years!",4.46

Emperor Julius,"The body pours a faded orange with a nice fluffy head. Excellent lacing throughout.

Nose is a wonderful hoppy orange, peach and mango. Taste follows nose with the flavor muted a bit compared to aroma. Just enough bitterness to balance the beer, but not bitter as a sister beer like Juice Machine. A nice hop flavor rides the taste to an easy finish.

Very good mouthfeel and carbonation is perfect making this one dangerously drinkable given its ABV, which is felt but not tasted.",4.41

Look: Pours a hazy light yellow with a fluffy white head that dissipates after a while leaving lots of lacing. Some floaters visible.

Smell: Fresh tropical fruits, especially pineapple, mixed with some citrusy notes of orange and tangerine.

Taste: Quite contrary to the smell, citrus notes are dominating here with tropical pineapple and mango in the background. Medium sweetness with a slightly bitter, minimally zesty finish.

Feel: Fresh, juicy and quite full. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Full and fragrant pale ale that tastes somehow exactly as you‘d want a double dry hopped 6.8 ABV version of Pseudo Sue to taste. One of the best pale ales I‘ve had and quite rightly a top ten beer in this category.",4.4

Double Shot,"“Stout season“ stamped on the bottom of the can

Oh man, I’m so happy to be here. I’ve been waiting so long for Tree House to re-brew straight up, OG Double Shot. This has been (and is still) the highest rated American Stout on BA for quite a while, I’ve had it marked as a want for nearly 3 years. So, let’s get into another world class Stout

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of dark mocha head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves nice lacing

Oh man, the coffee is so forward in the nose, but there’s still a decent anount of that TH Stout-sweetness still. I’m picking up on aromas of spent coffee beans, espresso, chocolate fudge, caramel, toasted nuts, brown sugar, and light raisin

In taste the sweetness is mostly up front, and it starts to dry off into a slightly more traditional Stout on the back end. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting coffee candy, milk chocolate, brown sugar, toast, vanilla, sweet bourbon, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of spent coffee beans, fruity coffee, cocoa powder, vanilla, brown bread, raisin, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice roast character

I gotta say, with this newly brewed version of this beer being at 8.2%, I didn’t really think it would be a true American Stout. And is it that? No, not really, but it still retains some old school characteristic, and it’s just damn good regardless. I’m happy to have made a trip up to Tree House mostly for this beer",4.4
Double Shot,"Sent to me by the one and only @ovaltine whose beer prowess is so amazing he can get fresh Tree House stouts in Indiana.
Poured deep dark, not exactly black but darn near. The head was as dark a brown as I have seen on a beer, the one knock was the head didn’t stay long.
The aroma, mostly I just get vague impressions of aromas as I foolishly didn’t wear a respirator when working with some nasty chemicals. Every once in a while I get more, and those are treats! This one gets me coffee and roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla. Mostly coffee, but wow it’s all in there.
The taste followed, coffee leads and filled the spectrum at first, only swallowing allowed the roasted malts and bourbon (bourbon soaked Madagascar vanilla beans, who knew?) and the vanilla sneaks in last. I enjoyed every sip and it was gone too soon.
The feel was excellent for the sipping nature of this beer, soft almost, counters the nearly bitter coffee presence.
OA, thoroughly enjoyed this beer and now I want to go to the brewery for a vacation. Sadly, my partner said no. If I wanted to stay married that is.",4.53

Tree House Brewing
Date: 18 June 2021
This is the last Tree House beer; I have in my Fridge. Every beer I have consumed thus far has been blown my expectations away. My first stout from Tree House; when I opened the can, a heavy coffee aroma emitted. I poured the beer into my fancy imperial stout glass. The pour created a creamy and foamy dark brown two-fingered head with excellent retention. The color charts around SRM 26, dark brown like used motor oil without the highlights.

Coffee is strong and present with the initial nosing. Dark roasted malts, toffee, molasses, a hint of smoke, a touch of char, and tobacco. The smell is dominated by the fragrant coffee aromas.

One of the strongest coffee-flavored beers next to Oliphant Brewing Coffee Ale. The molasses, caramel, and toffee tempering out the bitterness. This created velvety coffee flavors. The dark roasted malts give some char, bready, and earthiness to the beer. I detect

The mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and bold.

The body is heavy, has low carbonation, and has a robust finish.

The coffee flavors in the beer are rich and flavorful. One of the best coffee beers I have consumed in a long time. A must-try for any coffee stout lover.",4.5
Double Shot,"Pours dark and thick, huge mocha foamy head that lingers. Super sweet coffee and chocolate aroma with a touch of boozy Esa to it.

Double Shot,"On tap @ The Festival 2014. Black pour with a small layer of tan foam. A lot of rich, spicy coffee on the nose. Slight vanilla and caramel sweetness. Roast, cocoa powder, and a mild nuttiness. Flavor has a moderate bitterness of coffee, roast, and cocoa. However, a nice sweet balance to it. Plenty of caramel and dried blueberry. I liked this more than the maple one.",4.0
Canuckley,"A: Asphalt highlights to an obsidian pour that’s oily in circumference. The neck tops a bone white hue with a darkened downturn, of a penny toned rim. Thus, not much room for retention, which is limiting on lace entanglements. A collar that continues to lessen with a sensibility on heat, for slightly etching the windowpanes

S: A barrel awareness to stronghold the roasted grains with a bourbon presence. The start is a molasses coating on dark fruit skins, as an espresso roast loiters to the maple backs, of a sickly shrewd growth. Namely, a syrupy tumor upon the timed warmness, as malt creams the humid agilities. There are light recordings of Cherry Cordials at the midriffs, while maple further purifies a combating to an adjoining development in the bourbon spaces. Meanwhile, a balanced hop weight to avoid a suffocating middle, which provides a light peppery woodiness near rearward resin. Subsequently, a hindmost movement from soft to mild – vanilla oak – tannins that signify a leathery convoy, besides the smoked-dry turfs

T: The exertion has a cask dynamism of arrogance, as malt initially struggles to materialize off of burnt coffee. Howbeit, liquored hardihood stretches upon charred Raisinets, while conveying angles to figs & plums. Some positioning on early adoptions to tire track licorice with woodsy tannin partitions, which aid to reinforce those black treacle gears. In succession, a measure for the warming openness to adapt a caramel spread, for Scottish tablets, amidst the maple reinforcements on artisan S'mores. There is a small stake to reference trees of a deciduous nature, while dabbing at coniferous pine needles. This element further stretches across birch & paperbark maple, given a sharp (resinous) bite to kick-off the epilogs. To that end, a prevalence for maple to gridlock bourbon atop ruggedly pruned rawhide, while citing a slow-burning chimney fire

M: Sharply cutting feel that’s savvy in foundation with a bitter earthiness, and one to quickly smoothen out to the minute. In doing so, the effort is careful to not middle a cloyingness, by maintaining a clean acuity to the riding sweetness. There is a range of warmth that’s distinctively strong, but not a concern to dictate a heated fiasco. In parallel, a touch of acerbic tannin throughout, which works to profit the additives attributes with a slight sting to the clean & dry cessations

O: A fairly accessible presentation with a barrel presence to check the (semi-stick) extracts. A tactic that’s proficient in coordinating the rich malt layers to the woodsy hop effects, while bourbon perimeters all of their showpieces",4.25
Canuckley,"Brief Review:

O: Highly rated beer here from Transient, from my home state. Just got through Kentuckely, which I thought was just okay. Surprised to see such high ratings for this beer. Kind of a competitor to CBS, but with extra maple syrup and vanilla added. Gets a little muddled because of that for me. Little boozy and hot as well. It's a decent beer, I just wouldn't say it's that well balanced.

Recommendation: One of the better Transient beers I've had, but maybe not world class just yet.",4.43

Continuance Blend #1,"Poured from a bottle (b1) into a 2021 BBT glass

L: pours a very dark black brown, bare minimum head and no visible carbonation. Stains the glass somewhat, decent legs but less than I expected given style and abv

T: follows the nose well, chocolate notes lead nicely with raisin and vanilla not far behind. Chocolate covered raisins, some dark chocolate ganache, cream caramels. Get a nice coffee when nearly right out of the fridge, more than the nose suggested. Abv is there but never steals the show, makes itself known and nicely warming

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Who says that you can't have brunch at night, or that you can't have one on Tuesday? Kane Brewing's pick-me-up and put-me-down Imperial Porter means that you can have that Sunday brunch anytime you'd like.

Bourbon Barrel Aged Sunday Brunch is a bold and dark ale that pours with a scant froth and a near-black appearance to achieve the look of a dark roasted coffee. Its decadent and roasty scent immediately strikes the nose with maple, bourbon spice, cocoa and coffee. Its strong malty taste greets the tongue with a hearty sweetness of maple, molasses, caramel, candied coconut and vanilla.

And that decadence continues across the middle palate as the sweetness turns to a robust. dark roast coffee, walnut, dark chocolate wrap around the caramel and cream, and ushers in a bittersweet taste with nuances of charred oak, coconut, peppery whisky and a woodsy bitterness to offset the lingering malts.

Full in body, the lavish porter is mild enough in texture to mimic the feel of a nougat, suggared espresso bean, except with a hot chocolate under current. Spiced with a bourbon inspired glaze, the oaken attitude of charred woods and peppery tannins play a sweet and spicy tune on the after palate.",4.21
Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours dark and a bit on the thin side. Thin head fades quite quickly. Big maple syrup aroma, followed by chocolate and coffee. Barrel aroma is faint. Tastes like the original Sunday Brunch, with an additional depth to it via barrel aging. Flavor is dominated by maple syrup; cinnamon follows quickly, and finishes with a touch of coffee. Cinnamon adds a gritty dimension to it, and becomes pervasive as it warms. The bourbon barrel treatment doesn’t offer a lot in this beer unfortunately. Just a little extra chocolate and mellowness. Carbonation is light, and it feels thin, has a bit of a tanginess to it. Overall, not an exceptional BA beer from Kane, I expected a little bit more from the barrel program than this.

Sunday Brunch - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Disclaimer: Not a professional beer-rater. Just enjoy a nice tasty beer.

-Enjoying this fine porter on release day (01/25/2020). Poured straight from the bottle into a tulip glass.

-Shallow pour shows a nice brown color. Appears black and turbid in a full glass but the nice brown color remains on the edges. Head is a nice light brown, which died down pretty quickly. Not very much lacing.

-Very sweet smelling maple and boozy bourbon. Those are the only scents I'm getting. Not smelling any coffee really.

-Tastes exactly as it smells. Strong maple and bourbon flavor but that's about it. Would be lying if I said I tasted coffee. Pure bourbon and maple flavor, which is not necessarily a bad thing but it feels pretty different from the original Sunday brunch. One thing worth noting though is that it doesn't taste as boozy as it smells. The alcohol is hidden very well. Would not have guessed it was 11%.

-Mouth feel is near-perfect. Not as thick as I would have expected but surely far from watery. Perfect amount of carbonation.

-Overall, I think this beer is absolutely delicious and deserves its highly acclaimed status. That being said, I would definitely like if there was a bit more coffee flavor to it, as that is one of my favorite aspects of the original Sunday brunch. Is it worth the price? Debatable. But its damn good and I would definitely recommend it to any porter/stout lover. 5/5.",5.0

Parabajava,"Pours black with a finger of tan-khaki foam. Aroma is roasty, toasty, nutty, and caramely malts with some mild coffee mixed into the nose. Dark chocolate and molasses mingle for a little sweetness and complexity. Flavor profile is heavy stout, with roasty, toasty, caramely, nutty, and bready malts. Coffee comes in just after the start and lingers to the end. Mild coffee notes. Dark chocolate and molasses add a little further sweetness. Some bourbon and alcohol heat on the backend. Mouth feel is thick and heavy with a surprisingly still texture. Overall, heavy stout with some great coffee notes and some boozy heat too. Good blend of each, allowing the base stout to shine through the mix.

Draft.",4.45
Parabajava,"Extraordinarily rich and flavorful stout. Smell and taste of stewed, sweetened dark berries. Intense dark chocolate. Subtle licorice and dark coffee. Bourbon whiskey background that is more pronounced as it warms - boozy. Excellent head and lacing atop a rich dark brown. Glad to have found it on tap.",4.53
Parabajava,"2019 vintage, 13.2% ABV, 56 IBU, purchased form the cooler at Firestone in September and refrigerated until now (about 5-6 weeks later) poured into 2 snifters from a 12 oz bottle. Off-black color, about 1/8 inch or less of head. virtually no lacing. Wonderful roasted grain and coffee smell, but not as intense as some others like this style. Taste follows the brewer's description quite well. Most excellent mouthfeel; very smooth and viscous. Overall one excellent beer marred only by the hefty pricetag of $10/12oz and I prefer a little more head retention and a little more coffee-forward smell, which I admit is totally subjective.",4.69
Parabajava,"Look: very dark brown, nearly opaque. Some cola highlights when held to light. Nice frothy mocha head.
Smell: big roasty semi sweet chocolate and coffee.
Taste: much like the nose. A slight bitterness in the finish, but very balanced by semi sweet chocolate.",4.6
Parabajava,"12oz bottle of 2019.

Coffee so well done as complimentary accent. Nose was far more dynamic on the bottle, and the taste was exquisite. More coffee presence than the previous batch. Loved it!",4.71
Moment Of Clarity,"Canned 2022, no further dating available.

This is lovely. Balanced, approachable, and extremely easy to drink. The sweet stout base shine through in all its chocolate milky glory. The extra additions play minor supporting roles only, with the coffee being the least noticeable unfortunately.",4.53
Moment Of Clarity,"Appearance - The beer poured a silky black with a bubbly tan head.

Smell - The maple really came through in the nose. Chocolate notes were also present.

Taste - The initial profile was dominated by chocolate and maple. There was a coffee presence. The finish had vanilla, but was mostly chocolate.

Mouthfeel - The milky nature of the stout made it quite nice.

Overall - I have had better milk stouts.",4.16
Moment Of Clarity,Liker of Milk Stout but this one was wY to much for me..this one gets into that black licorice and boozy taste wherea I like my milk stouts with a hint of chocolate snd lighter.,2.83
Moment Of Clarity,"This one pours like thick motor oil and yields a beautiful two-finger mocha head that hangs out for a while.

The nose is of dark roast coffee, roasted malt and a touch of mapley sweetness. I can’t wait to dive in.

The feel is thick and chewy, and the taste follows the nose; robust coffee notes with a touch of sweet maple. Fantastic stout with huge flavor. And loving that it’s only 7.7%. (The fact that I used the word “only” goes to show how out of control ABVs have gotten!)

One drawback as I get deeper into the glass is that the bitter burnt coffee notes that I found pleasant at the beginning turn into a laborious astringency that makes me take the taste points down a notch.",4.52
Moment Of Clarity,"Capped off a week on the cape with a pick up from tree house on the way back. The selections at sandwich are limited, so I ordered a 4-pack.

It pours marvelously and has a thickly dark tabacco black. Aroma brings coffee and chocolate tones. The taste follows but for me the prune overwhelms.

This is my first milk stout, so unfortunately im comparing this to memories of barrel aged stouts.",4.22
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,I had a 2016 and was curious what 6 years of aging would do. Definitely mellowed it out a bit and knocked off the rougher edges. Mostly left with a mellow oak and vanilla bourbon flavor over a nice toasty base stout. Quite nice.,4.18

Smell - dark chocolate caramel molasses roasted malts boozy and bourbon woody smells
Taste - chocolate coffee with that woody caramel molasses bourbon barrel from the get go. Slight dark fruit and vanilla in the back with a little bit of bitterness
Feel - medium full body with a very light carb. Could use a little more thickness to it in my opinion but still nice
Overall - Really nice Classic BA Russian Imperial. Very complex with a ton of smells and flavors.",4.32

12oz can served in a footed pilsner glass. No date that I can see. Received in a LIF associated with NBS BIF #14 from @Whyteboar.

Pours black, opaque, thick-looking but not syrupy, with a fairly small but fairly persistent head. Smell is extremely rich, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dates, tons of anise.

Taste is super chocolatey, lots of vanilla, anise is more on the back end, hoppy/roasty bitterness coming a bit after that. Building up, giving me burnt toffee character.

Mouthfeel is medium to thick, bit of a chalky texture. This is a very good beer.",4.3

L: Inky black pour with a finger of mocha colored head. Solid lacing.

S: Rich and roasty... big time cocoa , coffee, and grains plus bourbon/booze.

T.F: Just like it smells. Loads or roasted malts and burned sugars. Vanilla/bourbon... dark chocolate, espresso, and chicory. Toffee and molasses with a bit of oak and earth. Dark fruit and a hint of licorice. Medium to thick bodied... warming... boozy but not as much as expected. Super smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

O: An elite BBA RIS. Fantastic flavor... and a great sipper. One to seek out.",4.33
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Quite a good Bourbon barrel aged beer if anything I guess it could use a touch more barrel character but it really did round out the aggressive hops and roast that the base beer has. Plus I think people are also forgetting how affordable this beer is I picked up a couple cans for under $4 each and that is quite a steal for such a treatment. Sure it may not be 100 out of 100 but it is still a very smooth easy drinking bba stout.,4.68

L - Appearance is a deep dark brown, nearly black.
S - Very sweet aroma of chocolate, molasses, and possibly root beer?
T - Not at all like it smells, and I can’t quite put my finger on the flavors. Mild carbonation, and I like it better as it warms. Not at all sweet, maybe even a bit bitter. Root beer? Char? Can’t quite tell, but unlike any barrel aged stout I’ve had.
F - Smooth, creamy, moderate thickness
O - Enjoyed this one because it’s different than any stout I’ve ever had. Def not your typical dessert stout",4.44
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz can poured into a tulip. Pours almost black; creamy khaki head that fades leaving solid retention and lacing. The aromas are malt forward. Hints of chocolate and cocoa. Some cherries and dark fruits. Mild hints of vanilla. The bourbon is pretty subtle in the aroma department and almost goes unnoticed. The flavors are balanced. More chocolate leading the way. More hints of vanilla coming from the oak. More cherries and dark fruits. Some raisins too. Some molasses. Subtle spiciness. Possibly some hints of rye and black pepper in the mix. The bourbon is subtle but noticeable and blends well with everything. Subtle sweetness. Low bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Subtle alcohol flavors in the finish along with an enjoyable warmth, but it's not hot or boozy at all. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy, velvety, creamy and smooth.

This is a pretty solid barrel-aged stout. It's subtle and bold at the same time. I always liked Plead The 5th, but never tried the barrel-aged version so I'm glad to have finally tried it after all of these years. It's simply enjoyable and fun to drink. Not bad at all. I like it.",3.81
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2013 vintage
12 oz wax-tipped bottle, into a snifter.

Crude-oil brew, viscous as hell. No apparent carbonation, no head. Nose is anise-forward, with notes of molasses and oak at the edge of the bouquet. Flavors are full of licorice and root beer. Molasses, tobacco, hints of coffee and leather. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected given the lack of carbonation. Medium finish (for the style), sweet with lingering residuals.

Wonder is the ‘top secret root’ is sarsaparilla?",4.33
Plead The 5th - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"From the 12 oz can (!?!) in a snifter. This solid imperial pours a rich
coal black with a very nice head of light brown foam that dissipates
to a thick ring, thin swirling pool, and shows some nice lacing. Nose of
bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark coffee, dark chocolate, balanced char and
roast, and loads of warming, astringent booze. Flavors exceed by a nice
presentation of brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, rich oak, warming booze,
dark chocolate, faint tobacco, dark fruit notes of black and blueberry,
and a nice dash of cream. Nice mouth feel; full body, rich, smooth,
lightly creamy, coating, light carbonation, and a warming boozy finish
with a bitter malt end note.

A wondrous symphony of malt and barrel in perfect harmony!

Some 'heat' from the alcohol is evident in the first sips, and the overall taste is not as rich as I remember in prior years. Maybe this one needs some aging to reach its potential., but it's a very good beer now.",4.6
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Roasty, boozy, malty. Warming up helps it round out into a pretty good beer. When it’s cold, it’s a bit thin and the flavors don’t come through.

Black colored body, with an extremely thin dark mahogany back lit edge. 1-1/2 mocha brown head, which settles back to an interrupted cap with an active surface. Leaves a couple of thin strings of lacing.
Aroma of roasted barley malt, dark coffee, and dark chocolate. Has vanilla and sweet bourbon.
Taste has bourbon drenching all the flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dark coffee. Has some expression of dark cherry. Chocolate first and then coffee. The bourbon, with its vanilla, cover everything and extend far into the aftertaste.
Seems like a thin mouth feel at first, but thickens as the body is held in the mouth. Slight coating after each sip. Noticeable alcohol burn on the tongue. Supportive carbonation.
This is a great sipping brew, similar to a slow sipping whiskey. Savor each sip to get the full expression.",4.36

Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bought from bottle craft in the North Park neighborhood of San Diego. $8.5 for a 12 oz bottle

A&S: Appearance looks pretty bland. No real head or lacing. The speaks of the head that are there, are brown. The aroma is pretty amazing. Powerful bourbon, sweet dark chocolate, toasted malts, and some coffee.

T&M: Taste is pretty tasty. Slightly bitter, sweet syrup, caramel tones in the finish. Unfortunately, there are some downsides to the taste in my opinion. I have been getting this with stouts for a while now, and I definitely, get it with this beer, but soy sauce is a part of the taste. Fantastic feel. Super rich texture, almost creamy. Carbonation adds a tiny kick, but not enough to take away from the milky tones.

Overall: I liked this beer. It was worth a try, but it falls into the category of, worth a try, but won't buy again.",4.37
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"This stout is hardcore. It tastes like something a witch would brew in a cauldron, or like drinking from a swamp of chocolate and bourbon. It's very reminiscent of Hoppin Frog stout variants. Rich, decadent and potent

Now, to be honest, I don’t know much about old George; but the fact that he made it to the ripe old age of 100 is pretty dandy in my book. Meanwhile, a beer that’s rated 100 on BA is pretty wild too. Coming full circle, I’m feeling it. Barrel Aged Speedway might not be as cool as some old dude who smoked cigars a good deal of his life and lasted so long, but it’s like the cool dude at your local Elks Lodge who smashes at Shuffleboard and randomly buys you a beer because he’s cool like that. Let’s boogie.",4.28
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12 ounce bottle, 2022 vintage. Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both good.

Taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but there's also some oak, dark bready and burnt/charred malt flavors noticeable too. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's rich, coating and easy to drink with a moderate amount of carbonation. This is a pretty good straight up barrel aged version of a classic imperial stout, really liked this one a lot!

The nose is of deep sweet malts and barrel wood, coffee, cocoa, chicory... Taste delivers the promise on home, with those sweet malts and barrel leaching, tangy vanillin, brick choco, cooled coffee... not so ""hot"" in alcohol burn... Nice, comforting and appealing feel in the mouth, on the tongue and in the swallow, deep but not overly sticky. Very enjoyable and i'm sure i will be developing a real craving for the remainder of this stash.

EDIT: I'd pit this against the venerable Parabola any day.",4.5
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2022 version.
I came in with low expectations compared to their 2020 Anvil and Stave BBA Speedway series. Reasons being : this was available for shipping ( 2020 was pickup only) , this saw very Wide distribution(2020 didn't) , this one cost 8 dollars for a 12oz ( 2020 was 15 for 11.2 oz), abv is 13% which is 1% over regular speedway (2020 was 14.4), They didn't disclose barrel source and not importal but the label sucks.

Smell: single source well made espresso shot with shaved dark chocolate on top, very little bourbon .

Look: looks like an Imperial Stout

Feel: coats the toungue nicely and almost a bit chewy but falls short cuz feels thinner than what i expected

Taste: heres the downfall of this . It tastes lime bottom shelf milk chocolate and hardly has any cocoa, vanilla,tobacco, leather or dark fruit flavors. It has a taste of cheap ass bourbon on the backend of this as well.

Overall: glad i only bought two . This one is a letdown, but i hold their 2020 to be the standard. Save yourself some money and just buy Regular Speedway. Its the same shit.

2020 Release: i rated All 5s.
Updated this for the 2022 release.
2022 doesnt compare at all. What a let down.",3.17
Speedway Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a mocha colored head.

Smell - The beer had a pleasant bourbon nose. The malts of the beer were also allowed to shine.

Taste - The profile was led by loads of milk chocolate. Bourbon was strong, but not hot or overbearing. The malts were evident as were hints of vanilla. Bourbon became a bit stronger in the finish with just a bit of sting.

Mouthfeel - This was not a particularly thick stout, bit it coated nicely.

Overall - This is a tasty, fairly easily accessible BA stout.",4.66
Twice the Daily Serving: Raspberry,"The color: raspberry.

The aroma: raspberry. In duplicate

The flavor: raspberry. In quintuplicate.

The feel: medium, full, and fitting for a grown fruit juice box.

This made me think of my Dad, whose guilty pleasure was a raspberry milkshake from Dairy Queen. This is all raspberry, all day (and night and the next day) long.

I thought the New Glarus fruited beers (like Raspberry Tart) were as good as fruited beers could get.

I was wrong - so, so wrong. This is traveshamockery good. Stunningly world class.",4.74
Twice the Daily Serving: Raspberry,"Canned 11.11.21, opened 11.20.21

Brewers Notes: Daily Serving was born out of our desire to express intense, saturated fruit character in beer form. After thoughtful experimentation with Permutation 6.47 and 6.51, we found that a base recipe similar to the German Berliner Weisse style, with its delicate, yet fluffy mouthfeel and even-keeled acidity is the perfect foundation for robust fruit additions.

For Twice the Daily Serving, we've amplified the mouthfeel, fruit addition, and ABV to achieve our most expressive and luscious fruit beer to date. Brewed with an outlandish amount of raspberries, this beer pours a gorgeous deep ruby red color. Lively aromas of homemade jam, juicy raspberry, and mixed berry fruit leather delight the palate. It finishes full-bodied, slightly sweet, and remarkably drinkable.

MALT: American 2-row Barley, Flaked Wheat, White Wheat, Acidulated Malt

HOPS: CTZ

ADDITIONAL INGREDIENTS: Raspberries

Poured into a handbell ipa , one finger pink creamy foam cap over a deep ruby red hazy liquid

Aroma is raspberries , raspberry jam

Taste is sweet tart raspberry ham , raspberries

Mouthfeel is credd as my, low sudsing , sweet tartness tang lingers in the my mouth mouth

Double Nelson,"16oz can dated 9/15/21.

Double Nelson,"Immense thank you to jrc1093 for this one. I've always wanted to try this little Kiwi bastard.

12oz can - dated 10/06/20 - poured into an ale stem at 40°F.

Pours a fully hazed, but just shy of milky peach flesh yellow, topped with a large finger of off-white foamy head with good retention, leaving a tall collar of lacing as it recedes. No visible effervescence through the haze.

Nose: Instantly recognisable as a Nelson single hop IPA. Green, grassy, herbal notes of cut grass, unripe horned melon rind, lime leaf, white grape, passionfruit, feijoa, lychee, leafy, vegetal wild herbs, unripe pineapple, unripe mango, orange zest, and a peppery twinge.

Palate: As expected, this greets the palate with the same Nelson intensity as on the nose. Horned melon, acidic pineapple, white grape, unripe mango, passionfruit, lychee, kumquat, and unripe melon rind, shifting into some greener notes of lime leaf, lime zest, fresh cut grass, and a vegetal, planty root note - green, and slightly earthy. This shifts into oily, resinous, leafy territory, before taking on a very distinct lime zest note. The beer finishes with this lingering lime zest, complete with a firm pithy bitterness, and showing some pale, flakey malt underneath.

Mouthfeel/Body: For the higher ABV, this drinks wonderfully. All the 8% flavor saturation, but remains crisp, fluid, and drinkable. It still has that soft, fluffy New England texture, but it's never sticky, sappy, or heavy. Effervescence is moderate, but very fine, lending a nice fuzziness. There's that signature racey Hill minerality to it, which compliments a wonderful touch of hop acidity.

Overall: A truly fantastic display of Nelson - so on-point, it almost serves as a Nelson caricature, in the best possible way. Densely saturated, green, leafy, and vegetal, with all the uniqueness inherent to Nelson. The base beer is so classically Hill Farmstead, which only serves to elevate the experience with an impressive display of quality and craftsmanship. Balanced, polished, and refined, shining everywhere you could want a Hill IPA to shine.",4.43

Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours dark brown with ruby highlights at 56 degrees; thick tan foam of mixed bubbles; solid ring, long lasting cap; moderately heavy lacing; thin legs. Strong maple syrup nose; faint whiff of smoke. Flavors of maple, coffee, sweet toffee and caramel candy base; lite roast, char. Full body, slick feel; very little warmth for 9.5%; moderate minus carbonation. Overall the maple has held up well; I could smell the maple wafting from the glass at least a foot plus away; not too adjuncty; the bacon is more a liquid smoke taste, but the dominant taste and aroma is Mrs. Butterworth’s. Funky Buddha excels at flavored pastry stouts, and this beer is one of its best.",4.58
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with a half inch khaki head that leaves very little lacing. Smells is very maple syrup forward with bacon, coffee and toast coming in the background. Tastes of maple syrup, coffee, molasses, toast, bacon, roasted malts, vanilla, milk chocolate and roasted malts. Full bodied especially for a porter, lightly carbonated, thick and creamy mouth feel, mildly bitter finish.",4.46
Wide Awake It's Morning,"Pours black with two fingers of khaki foam that retains really well. Aroma is heavy maple syrup and coffee with robust notes of roasty, toasty, bready malts and spry vanilla beans just beyond. It smells like a fresh slice of toast, dressed and drenched by maple syrup, while a roasty, steaming cup of coffee sits just aside. Flavor profile is dense and rich, hitting notes of roasty, toasty, nutty, caramely, bready malts, and rich, boisterious notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla bean and maple syrup. It smell and drinks sweet, but not to a point of being cloying, or sickly. Mouth feel is velvety and creamy, with a thick consistency. Overall, a thick and sugary beer, that while it lands more in the dessert beer category, does present itself exceptionally well as balanced and filling.

King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"From pint can marked PKG 07/06/22 16:09:32

Pours into my tulip glass a turbid opaque pineapple juice shade with a creamy bright white head. Fluffy sticky lace.

Scent is pineapple, grapefruit, mango and citrus with some pine resin.

Taste is tropical fruit - mango, papaya, pineapple. Citrus - lime, oranges, grapefruit. There is a hint (just a hint) of pine resin. Some green melon. Seems like a touch of alcohol esters.

Mouth is oily and heavier than medium.

King Sue - Double Dry-Hopped,"16 fl oz pull-tab can:

""Double India Pale Ale."" ~$21 USD per 4 pack plus tax.

Leans too heavy into tropical territory for my taste (think warm pineapple and dried mango), yet still lacks the assertiveness I'd expect in a true IIPA. A bit warmly boozy to boot, lacking in the drinkability department compared to something like Pliny the Elder or Exponential Hoppiness.

Not Toppling Goliath's finest effort, nor is worth its hefty ~$5/can pricetag - but it's a decent brew for what it is. Not better for not having been filtered, for what that's worth.

The flavor follows the nose with a hefty dose of citrus, then some pineapple, honeydew melon, overripe mango, passion fruit and a slightly bitter, earthy finish.

The feel is medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Very smooth with a dry finish.

Compared to TG Original King Sue 8/3/22: Pours similar color, milder head. Stronger aromas. More citrus flower and pineapple.

Compared to Welwerks DDH Dino Bits 8/13/22: Pours a lighter color, stronger head. Stronger aromas. More orange flower and mango. Less orange, cantaloupe, hop burn. Softer and smoother.

Compared to Phase 3 DDH Pixel Density 9/21/22: Pours an identical color, similar aromas. Similar citrus, pineapple, and tropical flavors. Slightly more juicy citrus and citrus flower. Slightly less green fruit. Lighter, cleaner, and slightly more astringent and dry.

Overall: Take a World-Class NEIPA and dry hope it. It's going to be what you expect. Absolute perfect haze. All of the same great Citra hop flavors from the original King Sue, but with extra hoppiness. The dry-hopping is detectable. It gives it a slightly extra fruity flavor, but with a pronounced burn/bitterness note from the dry-hopping. The original King Sue drinks like a wonderous and creamy NEIPA. This one drinks like an intense NEIPA that is in your face. Slightly preferred the original. (Rating: 4.34)",4.34
Blåbær Lambik,"Pours crystal clear, dark ruby with almost purple hues. 2 fingers of dense pink tinged head builds and hangs around forever. An essentially perfect appearing beer. Aroma has a huge minerality, only mild lactic tartness, subtle pungent funk, not much fruit. Taste is burnt plastic like funk, some bitterness, moderate tart sourness, blueberries are subtle. I poured the sedimentation in a separate mini glass, it has huge blueberry aromas and was much sweeter and richer, a blueberry cobbler character almost. The taste was a little more tart and a little more blueberry forward but still not a ton. Ok back to the main pour. As it warms it opens up a bit like a good wine. Fruit comes out a bit, and lactic acidity builds but still never reaches the mouth puckering tartness of most Cantillons. It’s very clean, crispy even, with a high but appropriate carbonation and very good drinkability. Overall, a very nice beer. Is it worth the hype/hoops one needs to jump through to obtain it?

At first the near absence of carbonation is a put off, but there is a very fine, prickly feel, and it ends up doing the job; flavour is appropriately sour, pleasantly puckering, balanced by a light fruity sweetness - like red currants more than anything; have to use your imagination to get a clear sense of raspberry, it's very subtle; there is a faint mustiness and oakiness; long, very dry finish, enticing, lightly sticky.

Give this a chance past the first few sips and you'll be rewarded. Bright and tart, with a refined and subtle effervescence and fruit character - the latter a disappointment for me, as I love raspberries.",3.79

Really enjoyed this, murky red raspberry color. Not the most attractive beer on the planet but the look underlies the fruit inside. I wouldn't call it overly acidic, more tart and chock full of fruit with lasting tarty raspberries.

Not he, just a thin, broken band around the shoulders. Nose is robust - big hit of figs, followed by ethanol and perhaps a trace of oxidation/soy sauce in the background. Taste consistent with nose - figs are a bit more candied in the flavor profile. Middle is earthy with a suggestion of chocolate and finishes with prunes and a light medicinal bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium in body with a still carbonation. Overall, a little past its prime. Not much of a suggestion of the barrel; however, still quite drinkable.",4.04
Great,"2013 vintage; consumed on 3/23/2022

Pours a stunning pitch-chestnut, an almost inky appearance giving way to slight ruby accents as a bubbly half-finger of pale tan head forms, slowly fizzing out to a sparse cap, expansive, frothing collar, and no lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma offers immediate impressions of jammy plum, refining focus to fig, subtle caramel, and toffee over time as an evocative, dark fruit overload springs forth across the bouquet; bourbon on the back end encourages a touch of cherry and lighter cocoa to engage the close.

Taste opens to layers of sugar plum, raisin, dates, and bits of brown sugar, growing in accents of bold fig and burnt caramel into the mid-palate; oaky vanilla meets fruitcake on the back end, while leathery chocolate dusts a barrel edge with slight bourbon and smoked toffee finishing.

Mouthfeel shows a medium body, dense and concentrated silky textures foundational beneath a low-lying carbonation; smooth, wispy grit guides to a mild twang underscoring a vague, burgeoning oxidation into mid-palate, followed by a mild barrel char and steady warmth on the back end, with some stickiness into the otherwise velvety finish.

Belying most any sense of experiencing time and age, this is a rich, comprehensive American barleywine; a deft composition of ultra-bold fruits, calm barrel inflection, and leathery resins encapsulating a consuming, classic apex of the style.",4.44
Great,"Vintage 2015. I was super excited to finally land one of these, particularly an older bottle - it has aged quite wonderfully.

Label Us Notorious - Calvados BA Big Poppa,"A peanut sized chunk of something floating at the surface in the neck of the bottle was visible before even popping the cap. Upon opening and pouring the beer into a snifter, the chunk remained at the surface which shifted to the bottom of the bottle mid-pour, so I was able to pour the last dregs into a smaller glass where the tan clump plopped out. It was actually hard to the touch as I plucked it from the surface of the beer. My concern began to grow because these Florida pastry stouts usually only have small flakes of more dispersed coconut lipids, which melt instantly and have almost no feel to them. Thankfully, just before my flashbacks of mouse skull chicken McNuggets fully manifested, it did begin melting in the palm of my hand.

Anywho, the body is viscous black with other minor spots of oils surfacing after the burnt mocha blanket quickly disappears to nothing at all.

Smell is Butterfinger with vanilla bean white chocolate and hints of caramel corn. As it warms, charred mocha coffee and brownie crust emerge. The aroma is hypnotizing.

Taste is decadent and a little boozy as the apple brandy barrel makes its presence known, adding sharp oaky liquor notes to the extravagant flavors of coconut filled pâte à choux with chocolate ganache. The body is just thick enough to dampen the barrel to tolerable levels of booze, allowing for additional notes of cinnamon coffee and vanilla custard to surface. The finish is semi-sticky and substantially warming all the way down.",4.33

The aroma is potent; and for me that's something. Fruit forward, but instead of heavy citrus I get melon and stone fruit, maybe some light pineapple and the expected hop dankness, though I had to 'look' for it. Almost hidden.
The taste is really nice. For the ABV, way too easy to gulp - I tried not to but a couple got the better of me. Smooth, almost soft, the melon and fruit play dominate roles here, a noticeable malt presence (at least I think that's what it is) and a firm stop by the hops bite before we go into juice territory. Really tasty.
The feel is appropriate to the style and without any 'bits' that seem to be always present in hazy beers. Soft is a word that came to mind, smooth another. Not pulpy, but full bodied. Very quaff-able.

Super juicy on the palate, really delivering notes of papaya and mango - and very little else, but in the best possible way. Moderate bitterness (low for an IPA), and a soft, semi-sweet pale doughy malt base that really amplifies the juiciness.

Near perfect mouthfeel, on par with Tree House (the best in the NE IPA game, in my opinion). Creamy and soft, yet with plenty of bite; high-medium to light-full body, with excellent (dangerous) drinkability despite the high ABV.

Aroma is dark malt, lots of bourbon, some dark chocolate and a bit of toffee. Fairly sweet and robust, but not really boozy at all and no hop profile shows up.
First sip reveals a silky smooth texture and medium to thick body. The carbonation is gentle, spacious and rolls softly across my palate.
Flavor is what I expect for style and what the nose advertises. I get some roasted malt and toffee with a bit of dark chocolate and a good boost of bourbon note. I also get molasses here and some dark fruit too. Again, no hop character, and the booze is very dangerously well hidden.

Aroma of rich coffee with a hint of dark chocolate.

The taste is coffee tempered with a splash of milk and sweetened with dark chocolate just enough to take the edge off on top of a bed of dark roasted grains.

Every sip is rich and full.

Overall, it's a great coffee stout - one of the best, the benchmark by which other coffee stouts are judged. It hits the perfect coffee / stout balance to highlight the coffee without making it taste like you're drinking black coffee and with a rich, dark stout as the base that holds up nicely to the coffee. Other coffee stouts often have too little coffee flavor, or sometimes too much, but this one nails the balance.",4.68
Breakfast Stout,"A little bit too sugary and carbonated for my tastes, but a world-class drink nonetheless. It will definitely be my go-to if I'm in the mood for a coffee/oatmeal-style beer.",4.68
Breakfast Stout,"I have chased KBS and CBS for a year now. If I had know how good this beer was, I would have been buying it up instead! Lower ABV, but all of the taste and feel of either of those. A little less complexity, but this is a great beer!",4.87
Breakfast Stout,"12 oz bottle
Glass: snifter
Serving Temp: room temperature (approx 71 F)


Look: Black with huge 2.5-finger khaki head that pretty much fills out the snifter. The head dissipates slowly to leave a slight but consistent khaki coating. Lacing is all the way down the glass.

Smell: Dark-roasted Columbian coffee with a large dose of bittersweet chocolate.

Taste: Pretty much the same as it smells. Coffee. Lots of coffee. With notes of bittersweet chocolate and some earthy bitterness. The coffee and earthiness linger into the aftertaste. The alcohol is not noticed.

Feel: Creamy and smooth with medium body.

Overall: A fantastic stout that has been one of my favorites since I first had it back in 2013 or 2014. I try to keep a couple on hand at all times. This one is a bit more bitter than I remember, but that's likely because this is the freshest Breakfast Stout that I have had in a while. I have mostly been having them at 1+ years old. At that age, the chocolate takes center stage and the coffee is the supporting act.",4.47
Breakfast Stout,"A - Dark brown / black pour with bubbly, creamy, toffee colored lacing.

S - Big chocolate and coffee roast aroma along with some char.

T - Follows the nose to a ""T"". Coffee roast and chooclate char dominate this beer from start to finish along with some coffee bean and Espresso underneath. Ends with a lingering chocolate coffee char on the back side with some toast cocoa popping up at the very back end.

M - Big medium to full body with just a slight bit of thinness around the edges.

O - This beer continues to be fantastic, not sure what took me so long to review this after drinking it for years. (As I scratch my head.)",4.29
Breakfast Stout,"L - June 2021 batch poured in January 2022 from a bottle into a standard pint glass at roughly 50- 55 degrees. 3/4ths of a finger light tan head. The beer is extremely dark and opaque. The head leaves a nice lacing that lasts for longer than most.

S - Disclaimer. I actively dislike coffee. (Yes, even the smell.) This beer hits with coffee up front, but I knew that going into it and wanted to try a well-regarded beer anyway. Then I get a dark bitter chocolate. There are some oats in there, and finally just a general roast smell.

T - Coffee is first, with some bitter dark chocolate next. I get a hint of a cola flavor. Interestingly enough, the coffee fades and the flavors just smooth out into each other. Then there's a small coffee finish. Absolutely not hoppy bitterness. The only bitter flavor is from the coffee/cocoa flavor. There is a little roastiness in the finish as well.

F - This is a medium feel, but a little thinner than expected from such a dark beer. Decent carbonation. Actually, there is a nice mild fizz in there. Exquisitely smooth.

O - Again, in all honestly, I don't like coffee one bit. The smell, the taste, all of it. But after the initial coffee hit, this was a great beer with balanced flavors. I don't see myself seeking this out in the future, but I'm glad I tried it, and I wouldn't hesitate to suggest it to any coffee-loving friends in the future.",3.87

rightfully a classic of the style. The 2018 bottle is very smooth and although I taste the alcohol, it's very easy to drink. The bourbon is definitely there and wonderfully balanced.

I like the aroma, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, coconut, cherry and oak. Really sweet and malty smelling. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some raisin, fig and chocolate flavors. It's sweet tasting but not overpowering at all.

In the mouth: here's where it's all delivered, right on the palate. More big, more booze, massive malt, plenty of bourbon, vanilla, cherry, and all the deep, devilish dark fruits aplenty. Yum a dum, dum. I could have sat on this another five years, but I just had to try it now.

Palate Contaminants: other beer, plus a nice fatty cheese

Medium brown color and off-white head. Lacing is present, but doesn't last too long.

First smell that hits me is flint. (That's... odd.) Scored sugar. Roasted pecans, honey-covered. This isn't the first time I've had this brew, but I don't remember any of this.

Maybe I should've downed this one and bought a fresher bottle to review because it has been one of my favorites, even if I haven't had it in years. I mean, none of this rings the ol' olfactory bell for me. Still, I rate the first bottle/can that's possible for me, so if there's wide dispersion in the quality, then it is what it is.

On the taste (of this bottle), if herbal rum were a thing, this would be it, right on down to the alcohol presence. And I suppose you can kick in a little lactose, butter variety. It's much more vegetative than I remember, too. It's more bitter than most FW barrel-aged offerings. Sweetness is moderate. (There's none of the savoriness that I remember.)

At least the build quality is still there. Good, fine carbonation, and there's a really pleasant woody/nutty aftertaste. Good medium-heavy weight. The overwrought alcohol presence is the only detriment.

I need to revisit this one.",4.15

Aroma: Heavy vegetative chili note, burned barrel, some underlying malt sweetness.

Taste: Medicinal alcohol, green pepper, some sweetness comes in deep into the taste, a little coffee in the finish. Hard to get many ""beer"" flavors out of this, even imperial stout flavors. Some pepper burn long after the swallow that builds a bit.

Mouthfeel: Medium heavy body, low, almost flat carbonation, little oily in the finish but pretty clean.

Overall: I love Prairie bombs, I've enjoyed a lot of the variations, this one not so much. I think all the additions overwhelm the yummy base beer, and it just comes across as a little gimmicky.

Pours jet black with a super thin tan head around the circumference of the glass. No lacing.

Smell is rum and chocolate upfront, with coffee kicking in just a little bit after. The booze is strong on the nose, but a bit of vanilla is there to balance it.

Taste follows the nose. The booze sting is minimal considering the ABV. Good balance between the sweet vanilla, chocolate, and coffee. The spices and coffee combine for an earthy finish that doesn’t last longer than it should.

Feel is full bodied with low to medium carbonation. It doesn’t stick much or leave a thick residue on the tongue, which for me sets it apart a bit from other Prairie stouts.

Overall, quite good. I had a tough time assigning numbers to this one, so I looked back through my previous ratings on various stouts, and eventually decided that I had to give this one 4.25 straight through. It’s not the best, but far from the worst, and very consistent across the board.",4.25

Mouthfeel/body is full, it's slick and a bit rich with a moderate amount of carbonation. And as with most of the Bruery's big beers, it's not as boozy as you'd expect it to be.

Brewers Notes: Collaboration with J. Wakefield Brewing

We took our original J. Wakefield collaboration Affogato Imperial Stout and aged it in bourbon barrels for 6 months at our Hudson Road barrel house. Affogato Imperial Stout is inspired by a few of our brewers' favorite summertime pick-me-up (& cool-me-down) Barrington's affogato.

Barrel Aged Affogato Imperial Stout is decadent, rich and full. Brewed with a blend of Barrington & Mostra beans, Affogato leads with aromas of vanilla, toasted marshmallows and subtle notes of bourbon. Barrel Aged Affogato has a full, satisfying body and an indulgent palate of vanilla cream, hot cocoa, rich brownie batter, with complimentary doses of smooth coffee and bourbon.

MALT: American 2-Row Barley, Crystal 120, Flaked Oats, Black Malt, Chocolate Malt, Munich Malt, White Wheat Malt, Brown Sugar, Dark Candied Syrup, Lactose
HOPS, ETC: Columbus, Barrington and Mostra Coffees, Madagascar Vanilla Beans

And it seems that my trust was well allocated, because the smell is absolutely beautiful. Chocolate, cream and with a slight fruity sweetness, even the few ounces at the bottom of my glass unfurl up and out and indulge my olfactory with incredible grace and strength.

F: A dry, moderate body and a crisp, low-carbonated finish.

Overall: An excellent NE-Style IPA that showcases mosaic hops very nicely. This beer is all about hop flavor just as any beer in the style should be.",4.44
Upper Case,"Exceptional hope load. Great lupulin bitterness, but balanced. The only way I can fault Upper Case is that it seems a tad watery and could be a little hazier -- related, I supppose.",4.56
Upper Case,"Canned on 8/7/20, consumed on 9/15/20.

A: Poured from the can into a tulip glass. Body is hazy yellow-golden with a half-finger white head that settles fast.

S: Really nice nose - a strong nose that jumps out of the glass. Dank, green, raw hops and a lot of tropical fruit: mango, some pineapple, papaya.

T: Follows the nose, with mango, pineapple, citrus pith and peel, and a bite of leafy green hops. White grape skins as I take a few more sips (makes me wonder if Nelson hops are in the house tonight - wait . . . I see that's not the case, must be the Mosaic and Galaxy hops instead. . . ). Alcohol is noted as heat on the back of the palate. Good balance, with a nice bite of bitterness at the end, which lingers.

M: Juicy in feel, call it medium in heft/weight. Somewhat juicy up front, but lightly dry and chalky into the aftertaste. A bit of booziness.

O: Very good. A little too much alcohol, but otherwise a very well done brew.",4.46

Modem Tones - Bourbon Barrel-Aged - Vanilla,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and a little bit of lacing.

This has a nearly perfect vanilla aroma to it, just so authentic, decadent, but not overly cloying, with dark chocolate, bourbon, dried black cherry, and coffee.

The vanilla treatment here is nearly perfect - reminds me of something like Vanilla Rye in its prime (not now). It's got that cake-like sweetness with a touch of dried cherry, just super authentic and not at all artificial. The base stout is super chocolatey, with some roast and a touch of coffee like bitterness, with some caramel and oak on top of it from the barrel.

This is thick bodied, sweet, decadent, but not overly so, with no booziness, and a very creamy smooth finish.

It's nice to see a simple take on a pastry stout done so well these days - sometimes all it takes is the expert use of one flavor.",4.76

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"This is one of the best beers on the planet. My favorite beer is Lou Pepe Kriek, and while of course nothing can replace LPK, this is as close as you’ll find anywhere outside of Brussels.

Montmorency Vs Balaton,"This is an excellent Christmas Eve beer. First it has a great color for Christmas and the cherry and warm spice taste is perfect for the holiday.

Bought the bottle of this during the pandemic when it was made possible to order and pick up. This beer pours a beautiful reddish purple color with a nice effervescent white head and excellent initial curtain lacing. Intense tart cherry smell and taste with warm spice flavors and a nice earthy funk. Enjoyed it very much!

Had the latest batch on 6/5/22 from tap at the brewery. The latest version lives up to previous. Detected a bit of rich vanilla as well. Really a great beer.",4.6
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"A: pours up a murky reddish grape hue, with a quickly receding, white, one finger head.
S: Immediate, cherries and notes of funk and tannic oak. There is something here also that comes off a bit like sugary cereal.
T: Surprisingly subdued, it is sour, but not brutally so, and the cherry is certainly there but I got some baking spice, what seems like cinnamon in the finish and definite (although more subtle) funk . There are also some other more subtle notes of dark fruit and oaky tannins.
M: surprisingly full, but still bone dry.
O: This is an interesting beer, it is much more subtle, nuanced and complex than I was expecting it to be. Full disclosure, I’m not a real kriek/Cherry sour fan, so I bought this on reputation alone and while I don’t think my mind has been changed about kriek, I do think this beer is more than the sum of its parts and has some nice complexity to offer. I think the risk and often the temptation with a flavor as big and assertive as cherry is to let it do all the heavy lifting because it tends to be such a people pleaser on its own. Fruited Sour beer has never been my thing and it’s still not, but I will say that if more these beers handled their subject with the grace and restraint on display here, I would be more inclined to buy them.",3.96

Consumed 5/9/21

So excited to try this. The be had an Atrial before and it ranked up there as one of my favorite wild ales ever. Upon pouring it, it looks beautiful. Love the color. I’m super disappointed on the nose though. I get a bit of funk and cherrry, but it’s very muted. On the palette though it’s more pronounced. It has a wonderful balance of cherry but could use more bret funk for my preference. I probably like the funk more than most people though. There’s a wonderful balance of sweet and tart with the cherries too. A lovely beer overall. Probably not my top 2-3, but worth the word class ratings.",4.41
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"L:. Pours a bright ruby red with a small pinkish head and no lacing, very pretty beer.

S:. Lots of jammy sweet cherry, cinnamon, and oak, with a tart cherry lingering in the background.

F:. Dry and lower carbonation.

O:. I love the interplay between the two different cherries.",4.48

Overall, excellent wild that utilizes two great and contrasting cherries that blend well together.",4.52
Montmorency Vs Balaton,"Unbelievably huge thanks to Anthony for this massive want of mine. Very excited.

500ml bottle - b6 (Feb. '19) poured into a fancy tulip at 48°F.

Pours an almost unbelievable glowing ruby red - I'm talking The Sorcerer's Stone red. Highly polished, highly reflective, mesmerising to stare at glowing ruby gemstone red - clear, but not crystal. A finger of quick, loose, just-slightly-pink head builds up, and then quickly reduces to a thin soapy collar. Some slow effervescence can be seen.

Nose: There are average cherry wild ales, and there are cherry wild ales that you can just tell are something incredible by the aroma. This is in the latter category. The amount of cherry on the nose is borderline unreal and saturated, while being entirely organic in nature. Not only is this a cherry bomb aroma, but what is really impressive is how both the Montmorency AND the Balaton cherries seem to translate. There is some intensely sweet, ripe, juicy Balaton character, lending an almost maraschino cherry on top of a maraschino liqueur note, bursting with big, deep, dark cherry juice, while the Montmorency cherries lend that floral, fresh, tangy cherry note, with a touch of stem, pit, and even cherry blossom. There is also a healthy amount of oak, and, along with the cherries, seems to lend this subtle cinnamon spice note, with just a whisper of oaky vanillins. There is a suggestion of acidity, but it doesn't singe the nose when inhaling, and there's very little earthy or barnyard funk. Just some wet oak, leather, old parchment, dusty attic, and a hint of brett. The cherries obscure any real serious funk or acidity that may lie beneath. There's a touch of gently toasty grain beneath everything, which is the icing on the cake.

Palate: First thing, from the very first sip, it isn't bracing sourness that hits, it isn't tannic oak, it isn't malt, it's sweet and tart ripe cherry flesh. The deep, bold Balaton sweetness greets the palate, giving up its sweet juicy goodness, while never coming across as artificial, cough syrupy, sticky, or overly sweet. This sweet cherry juice flavour unfurls to eventually reveal the Montmorency character beneath. The Montmorency is not quite as deep, bold, and saturated with juicy sweetness, but it provides a slightly less ripe, slightly fruitier character, that brings Japanese cherry blossom, a bit of plum, a hint of cherry potpourri, cinnamon/amburana wood spice, and a bright, natural, almost slightly unripe cherry tartness to the table. In addition to this subtle fruity tartness, the acidity lends a near-perfect degree of sour. It really isn't bracing, puckering, or blinding in any way. Make no mistake, this is a sour ale, no question about it, but it isn't Midwest sour. There is some lemony lacto pucker, a bit less of some acetic pedio bite, and a bit more of some tart, funky, mineralic brett, lending not quite salinity, and definitely not sweat, but that classic restrained brett tang, along with some musty wet wood, a little hint of bandaid, and that classic bretty stone fruit pit note. The high degree of minerality paired with the bandaid note and the deep cherry really gives this a little hint of a Kriek vibe. The tartness has a quick downward curve, allowing some really wonderful oak to appear before the finish, paired with a hint of vanilla, a hint of baking spice, a hint of caramel, and a hint of brown sugar. The sourness takes a far back seat, revealing some more dusty brett, and then finally, the ever-so-slightly sweet toasted grain base reveals itself, with a wonderful melding of grainy wheat and round malty barley, cereal grains, essence of cherry, and gently tannic oak linger on and conclude the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: MvB is light, crisp, and snappy by nature, though the mild to moderate cherry sweetness and slight bit of malt body push this a bit closer to medium-bodied territory. Effervescence is surprisingly low. It isn't flat, but rather lazy and slow. One might expect this to be a super fizzy, champagne-like experience, but that is not the case, which also contributes to a slightly fuller feel. Soft, round, and even quite juicy upfront, the ale is not scrubbing, and even feels somewhat smooth. The oak in the finish provides some tannicdrying as the sweetness fades, but the ale itself isn't tannic or ultra-dry.

Overall: This is a really remarkable cherry wild ale, and an absolute triumph from Jester King. The perceivable differences between the Montmorency and Balaton cherries is a work of art, and the structure, balance, and progression of the ale is nothing short of impressive. The acidity is forward, but kept in check, the sweetness makes a statement up front, and then takes a supporting role, the oak and microflora influence walks a tightrope right down the middle of balanced, and the subtle malty, grainy base beneath it all is something that I always look for, but rarely get in highly acidic ales. This is just absolutely world class.",4.44
XTRA DUBL Benthic,"This was the best of the variance for 2021. While it was very sweet, it wasn’t overwhelming and you definitely could discern all of the adjuncts while getting plenty of paste out and barrel. Amazing beer",5.0
XTRA DUBL Benthic,"Pours jet black, with a delayed yet aggressive dark tan head. Shockingly dense and abiding for having so much coconut.

Aroma is pure sweetened coconut.. and honestly, I am struggling to find anything else. It’s quite overpowering, and while the aroma is very nice, I’m missing the barrel and the coffee to balance it all out.

Oh my god, so much coconut. Sticky, milk chocolate covered coconut candy, coagulated coconut oil, oaky bourbon, espresso brownie batter. It’s a good thing it’s a 12 oz can. Any more and it would be tough to finish. As it warms, it becomes very sweet, and syrupy. Begging for more barrel, but it just barely squeaks through.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s very good, but it’s the definition of “pastry stout.” Pushing the limits of sweet ingredients that you can hardly recognize that it’s beer anymore. A touch of restraint or a tweak in ratios would have done wonders for the beer.",4.42

The flavors are also distinct and intense- coconut, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, malt, some vanilla as it warms. Smooth, an excellent full body, appropriately carbonated.

This is one fine beer. Strong and flavorful coconut, with the barrels and coffee right behind in flavor and impact. Just delicious. Extremely enjoyable.",4.59
XTRA DUBL Benthic,"16oz can, dated 10.13.2020, poured into a Half Acre ""occult"" snifter glass.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and opaque with a thin khaki head, loose bubbles and no retention nor lacing. The aroma is pleasant, lots of rich chocolate, charred oak, bourbon spirit, hot and a little bit of fusel alcohol comes through, vanilla, coconut, rich coffee and stone fruits. The flavors are nice, lots of rich chocolate, nice coffee that offers a bit of acidity and fruitiness that draws out some more darker stone fruits. The barrel has a lot of heat, lots of char but offers some toasted coconut, toffee and caramel forward bourbon while being dominated at the finish by alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is good, coating and thick, heavy body with a warm and smooth finish.

Verdict: A nice Benthic variant, but definitely the booziest Benthic I've come across. The balance starts off well but suffers a bit from the heat of this beer and the coffee is the element that fails to come across the most.",4.13

Genealogy Of Morals - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Bottled December, 2016

Color on the pour is an interesting reddish brown. Once in the glass it settles into a deep, deep brown with just the faintest of red. Almost no head, but a mocha colored ring persists. Excellent legs.

Aroma is rich and boozy. The bourbon / barrel are both there, but so are notes of chocolate, molasses, figs and more. . Very nice smelling beer.

As for taste, unsurprisingly the coffee has faded and I honestly can't even detect it. That said, I'm not sure it matters all that much, as what's still there is great. For my first few sips I was getting lots of barrel / bourbon, but as my palate has adjusted the depth of the beer became more noticeable. Nothing is in your face. The chocolate, roast, barrel etc. are all subtle enough that each sip leaves a slightly different impression.

Nice light alcohol warmth and amazingly full, chewy mouthfeel. Maybe I've given a 5 on feel before, but if so, I don't know when. For my tastes, this has a perfect feel.

Overall, while I wish I'd tried one of these fresh, it's clear that this is a very well-crafted beer that has held up well over time, even without the coffee element.",4.38

Tastes of bakers chocolate, boozy pralines and warming, oaken bourbon among layers upon layers of milk chocolate and accompanying licorice. This gets enhanced by chocolaty, wooden coffee, which inherits a gently, well dosed sweet peak, adding to the rich malt foundation of the beer. Finishes with less roast, more whipped cream covered milk chocolate and a light dryness, resulting from burned malts and a more pronounced coffee presence.

Flavors are as smooth as a seven-year cellared wine (oh wait, that's basically what this is), as notes of milk chocolate, creamy lactose and oaky astringency make an eminently drinkable brew, masking all but a smidge of the alcohol.

The first sip comes with two competing forces of marshmallow and spicy barrel. The barrel almost has a cinnamon hint to it at first, but not quite. Then creamy strawberry glides in, and is just present enough to help develop that distinct Neapolitan flavor. It's fresh, seedy and mildly fruity, while the base stout is chocolatey.

The medium-light body has a crackly carbonation and finishes semi-dry. A mild but complex and mature barrel heat brings peppery char and caramel. As it warms, licorice, date, nougat and fudge massage the palate further into a pastry coma.

There is a good balance of sweet and tart citrus, including the aforementioned lemon, grapefruit, orange/tangerine, and pineapple, and notes of ripe melon but the malt provides a rich, earthy backdrop from the oats and wheat. Others have commented on the hop burn but I find the bitterness to be clean and manageable. The mouth feel is terrific: rich and fluffy with appropriate carbonation, and the 8.5% ABV gives it good substance without overpowering. Overall, I have a feeling that this can is past its prime.

This beer is awesome overall but it's pretty far off of my favourite abbey quads. I won't get this again for a while, but I don't regret buying it, even though I paid $10 for it. Very complex beer with a ton of intense flavours that embody its style very well.",4.38
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"4/29/22 12oz bottle at Pies and Pints Fayetteville WV.

What depth of flavor! Beautiful bite/zing right away! Banana on the nose. Dark apple cider color or dark honey. Warming alcohol all the way down!

Unbelievable! I can't do justice to this with my description!",4.54
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"Pours a deep, opaque chestnut-brown with an explosive three finger head that slowly compacts over the next 4, 5 minutes into a nice thin white cap. These beers never look worse than ‘amazing’ in a nice goblet.

Both strong and gentle, complex, and boozy aromas swirl in the glass. I’ll try to name the most prominent, they all mix and intermingle together quite well. Nutty, savoury, and slightly spicy aromas on the nose, caramel and toffee. I almost always get a bit of rum like aromas on these quads and Belgian strongs. Others get wine. I think the high abv% + whatever aroma you pick up strongest influences what you tend to associate that alcohol warmth with. For me, it’s always rum and raisins. Definite some sweet, dried dark fruits here and I primarily smell raisin and figs. Possibly some dry dark cherries. Caramel and toffee, some savoury yeasty notes here as well in the back. Some dried, toasted woody grains. With both the aroma and taste, there are so many complexities to it, I don’t think anyone can pick them all out. Everyone gets it a little bit different, which is just another aspect to this phenomenal beer.

As with all Belgian strong beers, the taste evolves significantly throughout the sip. You get the strong alcohol notes up front, and the spicy ones as well. More of that rum soaked raisin cake, delicious yeasts, a touch of cinnamon but mostly nutmeg, peppery like a touch of black pepper. In the middle it’s nicely doughy and malty, with some nice sweet dessert flavours and dried fruit coming out to play. Maybe there’s a bit of dark chocolate here too? Definitely figs, raisins, dark cherries. Woody, port-like flavours in the background as well. Little earthy, little malty on the finish. Still a bit of caramel, toffee, and general dark fruit here.

Body leans towards the fuller side, and the higher alcohol certainly makes it feel thicker. However, the high level of carbonation gives it a very creamy mouthfeel and sip. Long finish, this beer finishes more dry than anything else and mildly sweet. Not as sweet as the nose suggests — tempered by the peppery notes and the carbonation, it keeps this beer wonderfully balanced. That carbonation was surprising but has that nice gentle bite on each sip to enhance that peppery flavour.

It’s hard for me to not write the same flowery praise for any Tripel, Quadrupel, Dark Belgian. We tend to only carry the best brewery offerings in Canada, and this is a tried and true style coming from a select batch of trappists and brewers who have been making these beers for decades (or even longer). If you’re reading this, I know I don’t really have to convince you. This is good. Really good. Foundational stuff. When you see it next, grab one for you and one for your cellar, you know you will not regret it.",4.64
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"I've had a few really good Belgian ales before, but this one is very close to being my favorite.
Received via trade from @Providence and boy, do I owe him for this.
Poured a warm dark walnut stained mahogany color and was crowned with a beige head, albeit briefly. Almost looked too pretty to drink.
Aroma wafted politely and was full of dark fruits (Figs, raisins, dates) and sweeter stuff like caramel and toffee. The taste followed, with a few spices that held it back from the cloying sweetness stage and balanced this so ideally I couldn't think of much to improve upon.
The date on it was about 4 months out so I suspect it was 4 1/2 years old. Still wonderful. Now I have to taste a fresh one!
The feel, well, excellent. Almost, but not quite, viscous. I still opted to drink this slowly and savor it, for it is worth savoring.
OA, amazing beer. If you get the opportunity, get it.",4.88
Trappistes Rochefort 10,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. Dark brown opaque color with 1 3/4ths fingers of light tan head on aggressive pour. Head stays for a while with decent lacing. A little bit of alcohol legs too.

S - Nice light caramel malt up front. Some good dark fruit scents. Almost a red or port wine. A slight sweetness. Maybe even a nice sweet bread.

T - Some alcohol in the front along with the malt. Slight chocolate, possible cola. The dark fruits and port wine are in there as well. Good complexity overall, so that each taste can find some slight variation

F - Nice high carbonation with a full frothy mouthfeel.

O - Overall, this is an excellent beer. Well deserving of it's high ranking. The complex taste of malt, dark fruit, and everything else is a pleasing experience. I highly recommend this beer and will keep purchasing it in my annual rotation.",4.76

Scent is citrus and tropical fruit. Soapy and floral. Papaya, guava, pineapple.

Taste is muddled tropical fruits. Citrus. Pineapple. Mangoes. Malt presence is constrained to a light pretzel note. There's a minty green note also.

Mouth is creamy with a nice weight to it.

This is a very impressive beer considering it is 3 months past its BB date. I can only imagine how great this must be when fresh.",4.24

Head is white, like soap suds, that just hang around the entire time, leaving mountains of lacing on the sides of the glass. Total hop slam to the nostrils; full on dank citrus. Taste is a spectacularly hoppy mess, with a consistency like orange juice, but with hop pulp instead of orange. Good lord this is amazingly hoppy, and full bodied, with very little alcohol to be found, as it is masked by the hop insanity. This is a pale ale? So says the can. Did they accidentally can a bunch of King Sue in the wrong cans? Nope. Picked up a 4 pack of each, and this Pseudo Sue might as well be a solid single IPA when compared to King Sue.

Look: Pours a pale golden color with a lot of floaties that eventually settled. There was a nice, fluffly white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. The beer became a lot hazier after pouring the bottom of the can.

Smell: Has a pronounced citra hop aroma - lots of grapefruit peel, orange, grassy, with green bell pepper notes on the back end. Smells peppery also and has subtle cantaloupe notes also.

Taste: The taste definitely follows the nose. Strong grapefruit flavors with a moderate to high bitterness on the finish that lingers but does not overpower the palate. It's very drinkable. I think that the flavor filled out a bit also after pouring the bottom of the can.

Feel: Has light to medium body, nicely carbonated.

Overall: Solid single-hop pale ale. To me, this toes the line between a pale ale and an IPA. Personally, I would probably put this closer to IPA territory than pale ale, but I can see both opinions. Regardless, it's very delicious, highly drinkable, and accessible.",4.0
Pseudo Sue,"One of the better Pale Ales out there. Has a very nice hazy appearance with light fruity tropical smell. I like the taste of the citra hops, juicy and mango citrusy flavor.

A classic, had several gallons of this over the years, drank it again after taking a 2+ year break - it is still very good, I like it a lot. Did I mention: I’ve got a thing for Iowa. That might have played a role, too.",4.16

Light and inviting floral and citrus aroma.

It tastes surprisingly juicy on the tongue, with tropical and citrus fruit notes. Mild hop bite and malty sweetness behind.

Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Light to moderate carbonation. Medium length finish with trailing bitterness.

Overall: I can see why this is so highly rated and popular. In short, it has a simple hoppy aroma and flavor profile emphasizing citrus & tropical fruit notes from Citra hops. It is moderately sweet with a perfectly balanced bitterness that makes it's presence known but quickly fades into the background. It has a medium body making it light enough to not be filling but beefy enough not to feel thin. I like the carbonation level which releases nicely when poured properly. You almost feel like you about to experience some hop burn, but it never got there. Tough review for me because I expect American Pale Ale to be clear to slightly cloudy visually, so I had to give it lower marks visually. But this is one excellent pale ale that I enjoyed drinking.",4.7
Pseudo Sue,"Brought forth from a tap into a clear pint glass, it arrived with a modest and enduring off-white head. The color is a relatively bright orange-amber, considering how opaque it is. With it, come all the right smells of an American Pale Ale. Malt, hops both citrusy and piney, join with a hint of yeast and alcohol to make a nicely balanced, if not pungent, treat for the nose. These qualities are passed on to the taste, which agrees completely with the nose. The finish contributes a dry bitterness that augments the solid taste. There's just enough alcohol to add another layer without harming the mouthfeel. For the taste and body, there's surprisingly little glass lacing. Nothing new, but this is one good APA.",4.25
Pseudo Sue,"Pours a cloudy, strawberry wheat color with a white foamy head that hangs for a bit. Some nice lacing surrounds the glass as I sip.

Abrasive Ale
Surly Brewing
Imperial IPA
Date: 17 Dec 2021
Another beer that I have wanted to be marked off my list. The beer is 46 degrees, and I used a tulip glass. A frothy and airy two-fingered bright white head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 6, deep golden yellow. Clarity is brilliant, with a few carbonation bubbles dancing within. The appearance of the beer is excellent.
Ripe grapefruit and juicy melon are what I immediately pick up. Smelling beer again, I detect pine, bready, yeasty, honey-like sweetness, oranges, floral esters, and herbal.
Interesting, I get pineapple, mango, grapefruit, floral, and herbal notes from the first sip. Taking another, I taste bread dough, oranges, pine, lightly toasted malts, pharmaceutical, and a touch of dank.
The mouthfeel is sticky, sweet, and coating. The body is medium, the carbonation is low, and the finish lingers.
This is not what I was expecting for this beer. The malts are heavy and drown out the hops. The hop profiles are unique in is own way. I was expecting something like a WCIPA and got a hybrid. I would not say this beer is abrasive. When I think of an abrasive beer, I think of Ruination, the first one, not this newer crap. The beer is okay; nothing special stands out as amazing.",4.11
Abrasive Ale,"Pours a light chill haze pale yellow, nice white head laces very well.

Aroma is fruity citrus deep pine resin, nose is good but not in your face big double IPA like.

Taste is definitely big on hop resin scrap your tounge bitterness. Lingering pine and grapefruit rind bitterness. Flavor is just tropical fruits and citrus. Maybe I'm just expecting more dinner is world class, it isn't bad but eh not world class atleast for me.

Mouthfeel is nice and almost full the oats really help with the mouthfeel.

Abrasive Ale,"This is a lovely looking brew. Golden liquid with a considerable amount of haze. Firm white head with a decent size, good retention and lots of lace.

Nose is a delightfully malty, hoppy and enticing combination. Malt has lots of toasted grains and light sweetness. A light bit of sharp alcohol is the only hint of the abv. Hops are healthy and dank. Tropical fruits abound. Citrus cuts across and makes it quite hop forward.

Taste is super. Big malt core wraps itself around my tongue. Pilsner like and lightly sweet.Then BAM! Citrus and tropical hops flood the mouth. Hop oil and pineapple, bread and mild grain sweetness. Finish is clean and dry and shortish with lingering oil and grains. No trace of alcohol in the flavor.

Feel is superb. How a beer this big can be this light and creamy. The malted oats really shine here. Silky swallow, crisp carbonation. Just top notch.

BDCS,"Bringing a little heat to the party, Ozark Beer allows for an extended aged Imperial Stout to bring all the bourbony warmth that would ever want to be inside of a beer.

Dark and tawny garnet brown, BDCS '22 hits the glass with an ominous looking pour with a dainty trickle of foam for decoration. As a bourbon laced scent of dark roast coffee, caramel, maple, chocolate and toasted nuttiness lays across the nose, the flavors open up with a sweet heat of coconut, chocolate, molasses, vanilla and caramel.

As the sweetness is quickly chased away by the roast and booze, the flavors of espresso sets in with baker's chocolate, roasted walnut and campfire to follow. Interrupted by the barrel, the flavors soon dominate with the strong oaken, toasted wood, weathered barrel influence with savory heat and bitter spices to close.

Full bodied, full flavored and laying on the tongue with a heated glaze, the stout finishes both hot and sweet with a linger of savory heat in a long lasting afterglow.",4.02

Oily, almost black, and nearly still. There is a thin head that’s quite dark brown.

Hershey’s syrup, vanilla, rich bourbon, some soy sauce, and it’s vinous, with overripe red grape and fruit. The bourbon isn’t over the top, rather it’s woody, rich, and elegant.

Ok, now that fat juicy grape bursts and mixes with melting chocolate bar, blackberry jam, walnut, and strong vanilla in the finish. The chocolate is a backdrop, weaving together Hershey’s syrup, dark chocolate Milky Way, and cocoa powder. The grape flavor is surprising in its strength.

Very smooth, medium bodied, light and discrete carbonation.

The flavors are intense and rich even though the body isn’t super rich. The bourbon is well done.",4.11
BDCS,"Appearance - The beer poured a deep black color with a dark tan head. Little carbonation was visible.

Smell - The nose was just like chocolate marshmallows. It was big and sweet, signifying a sugar bomb.

Taste - The taste was not as sweet as the nose. It was chocolatey bourbon with a dry grape presence. There were notes of leather and coffee. As it warmed, I was made to think of hydrox cookies, and their dry chocolate notes. This was definitely not an overt dessert stout.

Mouthfeel - There was just a bit of carbonation and a slick body.

Overall - A solid barrel aged stout that left me confused about the hype.",4.37
BDCS,"Sent by the very generous @jvgoor3786 in a recent box of goodies. I poured from the 12oz. can into a 12oz. snulip glass.

The taste is very bourbon forward followed by dark roast/coffee, burnt brown sugar, fine tobacco. There's a slight sweetness that offsets the bourbon that is wonderful. The feel is oily smooth with noticeable alcohol warmth.

It's been a spell since I've had a straight up barrel aged stout that wasn't overwhelmed by pastry ingredients. This reminds me of the early Bourbon County and Black Note years.

BDCS,"2020 vintage (released in 7/2020); consumed on 2/1/21

Pours an ink-black body capped with around a finger of creamy, pale mocha foam; decent head retention yields a few spotty, paper-thin islands of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a minimal amount of spotty lacing holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens with charry roast sporting a boozy cherry essence before a burly bourbon character takes over; burnt vanilla bean offers a slight bittersweetness over the middle, while the back end of the bouquet highlights increasingly defined notes of dark chocolate, Raisinets, and suggestions of cherry liqueur.

Taste brings forth a vivid expression of sweet, bourbon-imbued malts with some savory umami aspects; melted marshmallow, chocolate soft serve ice cream, with toasty malt tones interspersed between; sweet pipe tobacco and baked cacao over the mid-palate feed into darker brownie crust intermingling with persistent roast on the back end for a lingering bourbon barrel presence and touches of raisin past the swallow.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body, slick upfront and with minimal carbonation; steadily roasty through the mid-palate and mildly warming into the back end, a deft, boozy heat meshes with subtle grit and distantly chewy textures to close; a surprisingly tame delivery for a barrel-aged stout, though overwhelmingly satisfying given its plush characteristics.

Quietly unique in its extraction of the sweeter malt profile, this beer brings the notion of a cream stout to life with an amplified yet consistently roasty sweetness in tune with a pillowy body and casual warmth; balanced to near-sessionability for a brew of its ABV.",4.14

BDCS,"L: Black as pitch brew. No light passes even at the fringes of my Firestone Teku.
A finger and a half of dense camel hued head with average retention but a unique fingerprint of wide and thin splotchy lacing.

S: Soy sauce but lighter so than all soy brews I’ve encountered. This aroma is offset by burnt sugars, sweet molasses, dark roasted malts and the slightest vanilla and tobacco for a complex and mouthwatering brew. More vanilla as it warms.

T: Follows the aroma mostly, but tends sweeter than I’d hoped for. The sugars mask the complexity found on the nose.
Still quite good. Impossible that a beer rates so high on all parameters but only good on taste.

F: Highest mouthfeel rating I’ve given to a beer lacking the weight and sticky viscosity of the best BCBS years. This one is thinner but also an amazing balance of syrup, sticky, oily, and creamy. It is lighter weight perfection. You must experience.

O: I didn’t set out for a verbose review, but while so many BA Stouts fall short of my local Fremont’s, this one came outta nowhere with its complexity and simultaneous subtlety! A stellar brew on the nose especially, which deserves to be tried by stout-lovers the world over!",4.55

Nose is again big. Creamy and slightly nutty with a seeming wood influence to the dark coffee and light spice notes. I'm getting a decent amount of creaminess as well as nuttiness, so could this be a stout with hazelnut or perhaps lactose? Smells more like nutty creamy (erm...) than lactose creamy, at least to start.

Oily and dry and a nice high point of carbonation that helps usher the whole thing along. What it ushers in is cocoa/bakers chocolate and some further light cream. I'm leaning milk stout here, with a nod in the dark toasty side of things. Me likes. Almost kind of a coconut husk kind of thing with the nuttiness I was noting on the nose.",4.11

Bottle Logic lactose stouts TEAR MY ASS UP!",4.59
Impermanence,"Excellent head production and good retention. Overall, an attractive beer.

Tons of maple on the nose; it's definitely the dominant characteristic, followed by coffee and the rich malt base. I don't get much chocolate standing out from the malt.

Flavor is more balanced: up front, it's a stout, through and through. The maple doesn't take long to show its presence, but it's a bit woodier and far less sweet than the nose. This is certainly amplified by the bitterness of the coffee and chocolate. The result is more in line with a breakfast beer (a la Maple Bacon Coffee Porter) than a dessert beer - which seems to be the goal, based on the description.

Maple, wood, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, toffee, molasses, cream. The flavor really grows; I wasn't blown away by the first sip, but I'm liking it more and more.

An easy trap for a beer like this is to go overboard on the sweetness. While the maple winds up being the star (as so often is the case when adding maple syrup), it's still a pretty well-balanced beer, with plenty of bitterness. It's very approachable for a beer verging on double digit ABV. It lets you know it's pretty big, but it doesn't hit you over the head with it.",4.31

Congress Street IPA,Poured from 16oz can. Pours hazy yellow with a thin white head. Aroma of hops leaped out of the can and continues in the glass. Taste is hoppy and a bit of citrus. Feel is clean with a bit of hop oil feel. Overall it's a tasty IPA.,4.34
Congress Street IPA,"07/06/22. Poured into a Samuel Adams Perfect Pint.

A: Murky Arnold Palmer hue with 1-finger foamy white head with below average retention and spotty lacing.

S: Blasts of lemon, lime, guava, mango, peach, grapefruit, and orange with an herbal, honeysuckle note and a bit of malt sweetness. Esters are moderate and candy-fruity in nature.

T: Unapologetic flavor assault with lemon, lime, guava, peach, grapefruit, tangerine, and definite notes of honeysuckle and marijuana in the late palate and aftertaste. Esters are a little lower in intensity in the flavor but add the same candied fruit notes as the aroma. Bitterness is low-medium and alcohol is well-hidden. Delicious hazy IPA.

M: Medium-bodied with more dry finish than most NEIPAs.

O: A high-aroma, high-flavor NEIPA that is a superb example of the style and amazingly made it to my local store within a reasonable time! Thanks Wine Warehouse for spreading the delicious high-demand beer around.",4.42
Congress Street IPA,"On tap at Dominion Wine & Beer. Juicy , no hop stringency like some other Trillium beers. Cloudy faded orange. Low head. Dry, citrusy finish. Low aroma.",3.87
Congress Street IPA,"Looks like watered down orange juice with opaque body and a medium collar of white bubbles. Nose is vaguely citrusy before a swirl. After, I get a punch of OJ when I first did this. Later attempts paired that scent with some floral tropical notes and an earthy bitterness.

First taste was earthy and very bitter, but that seemed an anomaly after a few more of them. It remained a bitter beer, but some balance returned. After some sips, the earthy to dirty nature wasn’t completely shook and firmed the base. Hints of grapefruit and orange rind act as lead-ins to pine in the form of both wood and dark green needles.

The evolution of this beer isn’t much, it’s pretty straightforward earthy and bitter to my palate.",4.06
Congress Street IPA,"Appearance - The beer was hazy yellow in color with a fluffy white one inch head crowning the glass.

Smell - The nose was initially fruity, but the bitterness came forward later.

Taste - The taste was initially pretty mild with notes of papaya and mango. The profile shifted to bitter lemon rind and pine notes. A light bready backbone was present. In many ways, it was like drinking liquid lemon rind. The bitterness of the lemon lingered. This tasted like a take-no-prisoners west coast IPA.

Mouthfeel - The body was huge, cloudy like a NEIPA. Carbonation was somewhat smothered by the body.

Overall - I was a bit surprised by the bitterness, but I liked it.",4.45
DFPF,"On tap(!) at Lulu's Allston

L -- Ruby red with total clarity and a soft pink head
S -- Passionfruit dominates the show here. Bit of lacto acidity as well
T -- Again, primarily dragonfruit and passionfruit, with a decent backbone of clean lacto acidity for sourness. Not much else going on, besides a clean wheat bill
F -- Light mouthfeel, medium+ carb. Drinkable and refreshing
O -- Not as great as Miami Madness, but still quite tasty -- I feel like many brewers are testing the waters with 'clean' sours like this

DFPF,"This beer is one which truly lives up to the hype. At times beers like this gain a cult-like following without having the commensurate quality, but here that is far from the case.

The taste exudes the balanced fruits, and the mouthfeel is thicker than the beer itself, but not too thick where it becomes overwhelming or chewy. It is still thin and refreshing. I have had this on draft, in bottles (19 and 20 releases) and have loved every sip of it. It is well-blended and balanced, and a refreshing and enjoyable combination of tartness and fruitiness.

I love this beer!!",4.48
Midnight Still,"Poured oily black with a brown head. Most of the head disappeared pretty quickly, but coated the edges of the glass like the ring of a solar eclipse. Aromas of leather, pipe tobacco, coconut pudding, black cherries.
Flavors are rich, with a ton of dark chocolate, oaky bourbon, and charred marshmallow.
Mouthfeel is full, and the dense carbonation smooths it out. Finishes dry with dark chocolate bitterness on the palate.",4.33
Midnight Still,"2020 vintage (released on 2/14/20, so presumably bottled within a few days of that date); consumed on 2/4/21

Pours a glossy, motor-oil black body topped with a barely-formed, mocha head, quickly fizzling to a spotty array of paper-thin islands of cap, expansive, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of short-lived, webby lacing clinging to the walls of the glass.

Aroma expresses dulled notes of brownie batter cut with boggy ethanol as a slight black raspberry accents upfront; dark chocolate, caramel, and touches of pipe tobacco develop sparingly against a core focused intently on rawer bourbon tones and distinctly wet oak barrel; some molasses and burnt brown sugar factor in toward the back end, as well.

Taste bursts intently with waves of silky drinking chocolate, refined and creamy while leveled with a slight nuttiness; molasses progresses as the bourbon character deepens, forming notes of caramel brittle, burnt marshmallow, and brown sugar over the mid-palate as coffee bean meets bittersweet, malty char on the back end; a slightly smoky, ashy char finishes.

Mouthfeel brings put a fluid medium body elevated with a timely, fluffy burst of carbonation rounding into a silky grit over the mid-palate; heavy roast expands on the back end to counterbalance a growing bitterness with ample char, while a slightly sticky character gently coats the palate into an otherwise moderately dry finish.

From initial impressions of muddled heat and subdued malts, a level of forward, confident brilliance is expressed in equal parts sweetness and roast; the final product is an amazing flow of enveloping character, seemingly unending in its influx of intrigue and detail despite any apparent shortcomings.",4.18
Midnight Still,"2020 vintage - split with jrc1093 because wowweeweewoah what a champ he is.

Pours a seemingly fluid deep midnight black. A very minimal dark mocha head recedes fast leaving a persistent bubbly collar. The beer clings to glass, draping down and staining it brown. Oil spill.

Nose: Aroma opens very strong and saturated. Notes of bourbon-soaked brown sugar, drippy molasses, burned soft caramel, English toffee, demerera sugar, encapsulated by very heavily charred oak. The roast lends some milk chocolate, cacao nib, and a deep burnish character. Some bramble dark fruit and current highlight brightness, with ethanol fumes are quite apparent, and paired with this densely musty, sopping oak character, detracts from the otherwise rich depth.

Palate: Waves of rich, silken, malt-driven fudgy roast, caramel, toffee, cacao nib, burned brown sugar, and molasses lend an initial sweetness that is rich and decadent, before an almost unrealistic degree of flame-charred, bourbon-soaked oak barrel comes in and cuts it down quickly. Big burly bourbon notes, with toffee, coconut, pipe tobacco, vanilla caviar, and an almost bark-like tannin structure. The barrel and roast overtake the sweetness, and pair together for an exquisitely lengthy finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: Shying away from the thick, vicious, chewy theme, Midnight Still manages to deliver all the fudgy richness from the malt, with the sweetness fading by the finish, and replaced by dense, oily barrel. A nice fluidity allows it to remain drinkable, without ever approaching cloying, surrounded by a soft, fluffy carbonation.

Overall: There's so much going on here that seems so unique to this beer. This is not a replica of another - it is not a waxed Bourbon County. This is a beautifully seamless execution of balance between malt complexity and full-on bourbon barrel assault, with the only real thing dragging it down is the ethanol and musty earthiness in the aroma. This is one for the books.",4.52
Midnight Still,"Had this Sep 3, 2016 as part of corpulent's birthday jam. Drank this at that golf course I can't remember the name of up at Lake Tahoe.

Has the requisite 'used motor oil' kind of pour in viscosity and appearance. Aroma went hard on the bourbon and ashtray. Behind that you had some chocolate like fudge notes and an even smaller vanilla quotient.

Once again, bourbon dominates the taste, but it manages to push one of the biggest bourbon portfolio's without being too boozy or by eliminating all other beer aspects. As if KBS was less coffee and chocolate but more bourbon. Drinks smooth while still being able to drop some smoke and ash notes the whole time. Hint of dark fruit creeps in as it warmed up on the back 9.

I don't necessarily think this is better than the all time classics of barrel aging (KBS, Eclipse, BCS, CW), but it can definitely hang with them. Would be interesting to see what the score for this would be if it were a lot easier to acquire, I imagine a little bit less, but not significantly. It is top notch.",4.34
Midnight Still,"Novare Res Stoutfest 2020.

A- Oil black pour from the waxed bottle into a snifter. A small nutty brown foam layer appears on top of the beer with decent retention leaving spotty lace.

S- Bang on balance of roast bittersweet stout and decadent sticky, aged distillery basement and oak bourbon barrels. The Bourbon alone is unreal, peppery spicy sticky booze and fruit notes. Fudge and rich cocoa balanced perfectly by boozy whiskey. Roast barley. Hints of vanilla. Truly Bourbon mastery.

T- No arguing that the Bourbon is the star of the show but there is enough malt character to balance to near perfection. Bitter roast barley and fruity dark chocolate bars, french roast coffee beans, pepper, vanilla hints, brownies, boozy edge, caramel, oak wood degradation and nuttiness. Again it tastes like Buffalo Trace's sticky sweet bourbon barrel house. Strong oak bourbon malts but all pretty balanced, just HUGE.

MF- Thick and slick oily monster. The booze tames the hefty body quite a bit finding a nice middle ground. Slightly creamy and chewy. Ends warm.

The Bourbon barrel character in this beer is basically unmatched from what I have come across in the last ten years. A great surprise to be able to drink this brew in Maine and one of the best beers I have had in quite some time. Hopefully can visit this brewery again some day.",4.77

T: Smooth barrel aged roasted stout malt. Sweetness of layered chocolate, essence of coffee, whisky barrel and toasted sugar caramel.
F: Sticky, silky, just thick enough. Subtle bourbon bite, and lingering tacky sweetness.
O: Beyond expectations, smooth, and extremely drinkable for the strength. Delicious.",4.6

Susan,"From a single tallboy (brought back from a NE vacation by a buddy), canned 6 weeks ago, into a La fin du monde tulip. If this is what 6 weeks out tastes like, what must it be fresh? Superb construction: gentle but full layers of tangerine, passion fruit, with an incredibly soft mouthful…next to no bitterness, but there is a kind of malty thickness that adds to and also restrains the fruity juiciness.

First beer I’ve ever had a chance to try from HF, and I wish it wasn’t an NEIPA, but even so, damn.",4.51
Susan,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at Hill Farmstead Brewery in Greensboro Bend, Vermont for nineteen dollars. My fifteenth brew from these guys. Outstanding.",4.5
Susan,"Can dated 8/30; best by 9/27:
Loved this beer originally two weeks ago, but these had on the best by date aren't jumping out at me quite as much. I actually do not think it's because of age, just my palate being a little different when I did this review.

That aside, this is still a very good IPA, especially if I am patient enough to let it warm to the proper temperature from my cold fridge. The look is a quite highly hazed, near but not 100% opaque. As with many HF beers, the head and lacing are pretty strong.

Nose is a mix of tangerine, grapefruit, and some form of sweet fruit - I want to say a little pineapple. There's a light herbal note that comes somewhat as a muted mint to me, but is definitively a foreshadowing of some form of bitterness in the taste.

Medium heft, maybe a little less, with a prickly carbonation biting through the softer edges. More citrus rind and fruit - tangerine, orange, and some sweet ruby grapefruit, with a little huskiness from the barley and/or other grains. Not really any of the tropical fruit accent from the nose. The back end is bitter, but it has an interesting sheen of maltiness to it. Bittersweet leaning heavily on the first part, the latter keeps things from getting out of hand. As expected, a well constructed brew that brings both malt and hop to the experience.",4.49
Susan,"Pours a fairly hazy yellow-light orange. Wonderful passionfruit and orange hop flavors on the nose. The palate follows through with plenty of citrus and tropical hop flavors. A very refined, well-crafted beer where everything just works.",4.61
Susan,"Pours a bright, completely opaque, orange color. Thick, sudsy off white head forms, then dissipates leaving a quarter inch of foam in the glass along with plenty of sticky lacing. Aroma has notes of tangerine, orange marmalade, grass, dried vegetation and a slight woody character to it.

Taste follows the nose with notes of citrus, orange, orange marmalade, and peach giving way to a grassy, vegetal, woody hop character on the back end. Clearly the Riwaka are coming through on the back end. Moderately bitter, mildly sweet, completely delicious. Feel is moderately bodied, smooth, and pretty easy drinking. Moderate carbonation.

This is a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead - they get so much out of the hops both in the aroma and taste, its impressive.",4.46
Susan,"Very, very attractive beer. Burned orange in color, but what really stands out is the gorgeous head. Dense, foamy & long lasting with extensive lacing. Aroma has lots of citrus & tropical notes, with orange being what jumps out at me the most.

Taste has more of the tropical / citrus notes with the hops working well together. The orange detected on the nose is not present on the tongue, although some hints of grapefruit do come through. Amazingly full mouthfeel. Good beer.",4.32
Susan,"Had this beer on tap at the Mule Bar in Winooski, Vermont, just outside of Burlington. Excellent! Another good one that day that is not listed here was called ""William"" and that was superb also. This is obviously a top class brewery, worth visiting the next time we are up here.",4.5
Susan,"Appearance: Pours a rather cloudy orangeade color with a two finger head; solid persistence and streaks of lace

Smell: There are both grassy and floral tones here, with stone fruit and lemon in the mix

Taste: The flavors here are subtle but bring an interesting spectrum; stone fruit and passion fruit are featured, with a lemon aspect; the bitterness builds nicely but is held in check so that it doesn't overwhelm

Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation

Overall: A very nice IPA but the progeny has boosted this to the top of the IPA charts; not saying it doesn't belong there but I wonder whether the subtlety would shine as much in a blind tasting",4.49
Susan,"Received from a friend in exchange for a collection of Equilibrium DIPAs/TIPAs...

L: beautiful, rich golden maize color with a 3/4"" of thick head that dissipated after a few minutes. Somewhat opaque, owing to the unfiltered packaging.
S: some clean, piney wafts along with a noseful of citrus and sugary-sweet hops (maybe the Riwaka?). Very appealing.
T: bright citrus scent on the nose makes its way down but is quickly subdued by dank and slightly bitter (WA state?) hops that make for a really interesting APA.
F: mild carbonation, very quaffable. Hop bitterness lingers nicely.
O: a near-perfect rating for good reason; this is a great take on a classic variety that has been overshadowed by the new shiny toy (NE/hazy IPAs). Fantastic beer.",4.49
Susan,"Canned 6/8/21. Drink by 7/6/21.

L: Pours a deep orange with a fluffy white head that quickly dissipates to a thin film. Beautiful lacing.

S: Orange, peach, apricot. None of the dirty socks aroma that sometimes comes with Simcoe.

T: Follows the aroma up front, then pivots to grapefruit in the middle. Finishes quite dry with just a slight bitterness.

F: Super soft mouthfeel, appropriate carbonation.

O: An outstanding IPA. The aromas and flavors are subtle but distinct, and the mouthfeel is sublime.",4.53

Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Covid screwed up Huhaphu last March and I got some perks because of it. Wife and I travelled to Tampa from the Daytona area for a day trip and CC had a small trailer set up with several of their best brews there to taste. I NEVER thought I'd have this but am so glad I was able to try it. Amazingly smooth and apprecibly tastier than regular Imp Stout (which is great). Yay Cigar City,4.82
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Good head production and decent retention. The body is wonderfully dark, as is the dark brown head, while it lasts.

The aroma on this is powerful and decadent. From the moment of the pour, to sitting in the glass feet away, I'm getting strong notes of chocolate, molasses, and bourbon. Up close, it's even sweeter, with vanilla, syrup, honey, and brown sugar joining the mix, along with cinnamon and chilies. The nose is, quite simply, wonderful.

Despite the sweetness of the nose, the brew is quite roasty and bitter up front. Light but noticeable pepper heat. Tons of dark fruit flavor, blackstrap molasses, oak, and bitter chocolate; slightly vegetal. Lasting prune and raisin, along with bourbon, on back third, leading to chocolate and cinnamon on the finish.

Thick and full bodied.",4.46
Hunahpu's Imperial Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"500mL bottle into a snifter
Vintage 2021

A: Pours midnight black and somewhat viscous in appearance. Immensely dark head of 1plus fingers width dissipates at a moderate rate. Leaves only a few patches of lacing. 4.75

S: Aroma is, my god. Massive cinnamon, big chocolate, vinous dark fruits, luscious bourbon, capsaicin peppery heat, red wine. Barrel notes are moderate in strength and compliment the beer wonderfully. Some base beer notes primarily roasted malt. Fire roasted marshmallows rounds it out. Goodness gracious. 4.75

T: Taste is also excellent, albeit perhaps a bit less voluptuous. I again get huge vinous and red wine notes up front, hell is actually tastes like it’s red wine barrel
aged. Next comes the cinnamon and rich, fine high cocoa content dark chocolate. On the finish there is roasted malt, charred oaky bourbon notes, some balancing bitterness. This is just wave after wave of flavors and it’s quite frankly just impressive. 4.75

M/D: Mouthfeel is full bodied and thick. ABV is not noticeable which is impressive. Drinkability, however, is quite limited. The combination of the heavy/thick feel and adjunct laden flavor profile make 500mL of this feel like 3 gallons (and this is coming from someone who drinks Bourbon County all the time and even old school 750mL Black Tuesdays without any trouble). 4

O: Overall, this is quite the beer. Normally beers this adjunct heavy can be not really my thing, but this one just pulls it off wonderfully. Probably more appropriate as an 8oz pour as opposed to a 500mL solo bottle, but still, well done Cigar City, well done. 4.5",4.63

Nose is sweet peach, citrus, grass, melon and grapefruit. Melons along the lines of honeydew and cantaloupe. Very nice cornucopia of fruits. Nice sweetness with a good balance of grassy hop presence.

Taste is similar. Peach, citrus, and melon, and a relatively strong weed dankness that wasn't as present on the nose. Also it could just be a phantom effect but I get brief moments of raspberry. Medium bitterness, almost reaching something on the higher side of what you'd expect on a NEIPA. mild to medium hop burn as you drink, building on the back of the throat. Very mild cracker malt backbone. Barely shows up and is overwhelmed by the fruit, weed, and grass presence.

Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied for a NEIPA. Mild carbonation. The hop bitterness and alcohol level, makes this brew feel a little more harsh and bubbly than it actually is.

Heavy Mettle,"Poured from a can dated 2 days ago (fresh!) into a tulip glass. Pours an opaque pale orange/yellow color (like white grapefruit juice) with a pretty aggressive head with decent retention. Scents of sweet tropical punch and candy. I’ve been on a hazy DIPA kick this summer, so a lot of them blend together but this one definitely has some unique notes coming through. The description by Trillium says pink starburst, and I’m definitely getting some of that- really candy like fruity flavor. I’m also getting some bitter citrus and sweet tropical fruits. Lingering bitterness from hop oils on the palate. I have to say this one sneaks up on you at 9+% because you don’t even notice it. So many beers at that level have a very obvious alcohol burn and taste but this one is totally smooth for that ABV. My first time trying heavy mettle (I’ve had one in the alloy series and death mettle) and I think this one is my fav of the bunch.

Flavor profile is apricot forward, which lays on top of herbal, lemongrass, and stone. Finish is notably tangy and funky, much more so than the nose. Mouth feel is medium in thickness with a near still effervescence. Overall, soft and plump, just like a ripe apricot.

Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 375mL bottle.",4.34
La Fosse,"Gold in color with a faint haziness. There’s just a trace of off white on top. Smell is of fresh apricots and faint lactobacillius. I’m tasting tart lactobacillius with a sweet apricot finishz. The mouth is dry, crisp, and refreshing.",4.34

Appearance: A nice clear golden colour with a one finger white head that had decent retention while leaving some nice lacing.

Aroma: Earthy, oak, rhubarb, light funk, musty, damp wood, hay, apricot, green apple, pear, with sherbet like lemon notes.

Taste: Light to moderately sour, oak, lemon peel, unripe apricot, apple skin, with light funk and notes of hay.

Mouthfeel: Dry, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Excellent, balanced, complex flavours and really enjoyable to drink.",4.7
Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"First beer of 2022! Poured from a bottle (11Feb2020 - no 37 - 19|20) into a geuze glass

L: pours a turbid, darker orange yellow with a moderate, crackling white head. Moderate visible carbonation feeding the minimal head. Think I stirred the lees moving the bottle from the fridge, my bad. Second glass, while still turbid, is notably less so - more of a brighter, golden yellow. Some chunky lacing left with each sip

S: that classic, seductive 3F geuze nose. Pleasant bit of barnyard funk to open, with some bright fruit notes quickly behind. Slight cheese, assertively but appropriately acidic - on the fruit front, granny smith apple, bit of lemon flesh, some white peach. Some chardonnay grape as well. Great mix of bright fruit and complex, earthy funk

T: great swallow, delivers a nice mix of fruit and sour with bright acidity. Slight pucker at first with notes of green apple, bright and pronounced citrus. That lemon flesh character from the nose comes through well here, pleasantly sharp and leads into the medium-long finish. That more cheesy barnyard funk is more toward the finish, leaves this great lingering note with a rustic baked bread flavor as well. Flavor dances nicely in that unique way, really nice

F: medium- body, medium+ carbonation. Nicely drying, that bit of tart that suggests a nice sip

O: wonderful and tasty geuze. Bright acidity and pleasant, complex funk; solid fruit character, big fan",4.46

Consumed 12/30/21

So excited to finally try this bottle that I got in a trade from Belgium. We're finally seeing a bit more 3 Fonteinen in Chicago with them dropping Intense Red and Homage in mass recently. It's a very pretty lambic. A medium hued peach in color with nice carbonation and lacing that stays around. I don't get as much off the nose as I would like while it's cold but the flavors jump out more on the tongue thankfully. As it warmed the lambic funk started to come through. There's so much happening flavor wise here. Tartness is medium to medium high. I wish there were a bit more funk but it's present. It recognizable as a 3 Fonteinen beer immediately to me. The feel is superb with the carbonation and dry finish. Overall I don't know if it's my favorite 3F, but it's up there. Worth picking up a 2nd one if you can get 2.",4.54

Oude Geuze Golden Blend,"L: Golden/orange with a touch of haze, thin head, and little lacing.

S: Honey, flowers, apricot, a touch of vinegar. Funky notes intermingles as well, some classic Brett barnyard character. Bready malt.

T: Very tart and tangy, apricot, honey crisp apple, honey, and some citrus flavors. Some bready malt on the finish, but stays fruity and sour the whole way through.

F: Moderate body, fine carb but nice crispness. Dry finish.

Overall: An absolute pleasure of a beer. Not super sour either, even for a vintage from 2018. I highly recommend this to any fan of the style.",4.47
Hommage,"Pours a pulpy red hue - kinda a dull garnet type of color. This is honestly one of the uglier lambics that I have cast my eyes on. Aroma is quite fantastic, a combination of raspberry jam with the slight mustiness of a kriek. It's got jammy raspberry with some overt tartness. There's also an underpinning of chamomile. They say don't meet your heroes and often times with beer, it feels like you are set up for disappointment when you have a highly sought after and/or highly regarded beer. This is a true icon of the lambic game and rightfully so.",4.52
Hommage,"Felt an appropriate day to open this, given the news of Armand's recent passing. Ruby red in the glass with a small fizzy head that dissipates quickly. Aromas are balanced between raspberry and cherry pie filling, with a nice lemony acidity from the base lambic. Flavors are tart, a bit less fruity than expected, with more of a raspberry character. Overall I like it, although not quite as much as Framboos

85/100",4.24
Hommage,"Two year old bottle.

Beautiful strawberry color in the glass, completely transparent if decanted - darker and murkier with the yeast, however, nearly completely opaque. I prefer my yeast be included in my Belgians (for health, of course), but I'm not holding that against the appearance score. Pale pink fizzy head, brief lived, leaving the body completely still.

Extraordinary nose: tart and fruity, but equally funky, earthy, and sharp. Earthy, dirty, mushroom-like funk; raspberry and cherry; oak and must; a great example of the oft-mocked ""horse blanket.""

The palate has less earthy funk, but it's still there, especially on the back half. Up front, it's a blend of the sharp tartness of the berries and a light white wine vinegar-like sourness. Cherry skins and raspberry on the back third and finish.

Strongly sour, more in line with many American takes on sours and wild ales than most Belgian Lambics, owing at least in part to the sharpness of the berries. Mouth puckering; lingering sourness about the gums. Swishing, swirling, and chewing is almost dangerous. There's no vinegar burn, however.

This is world class, but if more of the funkiness translated to the palate and cut through the sourness, it would be among the best beers I've ever had. As it is, it's easily one of the best fruited Lambics in the world, different in character from Cantillon, but just as good. Perhaps the funk becomes more pronounced with age.",4.61

Pours deep, medium-hazy red with a finger of off-white head.

The nose is raspberry, cherry, lemon, and vinegar.

The taste opens with medium-sour lemon, vinegar, and green olive and finishes with raspberry and cherry. Very low sweetness and medium tartness. The initial pop of vinegar and green olive is somewhat off-putting, but the beer becomes more balanced and fruity as it warms and my palate adjusts.

The mouthfeel is medium for the style. Puckering tartness with a clean finish.

Overall, a very well-made lambic, maybe not my favorite flavor profile at the end of the day but it definitely grew on me. It could use a touch more jammy sweetness to offset the vinegar.",4.28

Hommage,"Bottled on 9/18/2013 - consumed on 7/18/2021. Poured from a caged-and-corked 375mL bottle into my Drie de Fonteinen tumbler.

Cloudy cinnabar body supports a thin layer of very pale pink foam which dissipates to a vague collar pretty rapidly; poor retention, no legs.

Intensely, flamboyantly aromatic - suffused with bright berry, cherry, and fine aged red wine vinegar notes. Wild and complex.

Bracing acidity, with pepper and mild cheese notes quickly overwhelmed by tart fruit. Perfectly blended lambic with nuts, peppercorn, wildflower, honey, and foraged greens emerging occasionally beneath the raspberry and barnyard notes. Some minerality but not too many tannins in the finish, which while dry, isn't puckering.

Milky, smooth mouth-feel - could do with a tiny bit more carbonation perhaps, but it isn't bad for the style.

A fitting tribute - one of the best examples of the style I've had in quite some time.",4.5
Saison Bernice,"Brief Review:

O: My first SARA beer here, very lucky to grab this from SF on a trip this past April. Been hearing a lot of great things about them for years. Really digging this. Very clean, light, complex. Just a slight funk, not overly tart. Great carbonation and mouthfeel. Don't have much to compare it to from the brewery, but as far as saisons and wild ales go, this is certainly top notch.

Recommendation: Definitely on par with some things I've had from HF, this is a really good beer from an awesome brewery.",4.7
Saison Bernice,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date. Poured into a 3 Fonteinen stemmed glass.

Taste: Light sour, tart, and funk, stone fruit, apricot, peach, citrusy notes, lemon zest, orange peel, vanilla, peppercorn, floral.

Poured nearly black, which for a winter ale was a bit surprising. Still, capped with the brown head it looked quite enticing.
The aroma was bourbon, and that’s about it.
The taste followed- there was some roasted malts that came through but I couldn’t find any coconut in the mix. Not sure if if it “aged out” or something, but I never found it.
The feel was excellent for the flavors, bourbon is a sipping drink you know.
I am glad to have tried this, but would like to revisit a fresher version if possible.",4.09
Coconut B-Bomb,Bottle: Poured a deep brown color ale with a large brown foamy head. Aroma of strong coconut notes with some sweet caramelized malt and chocolate notes is quite enticing.

M: It feels full-bodied and very smooth on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation. The alcohol lends some warming to the finish.

KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"I warmed to this beer slowly, but it's now easily my favorite KBS variant, as well as my favorite stout from Founders overall. Title implies the stout may be sickeningly sweet, but there is nothing excessive here. It still tastes like beer, not a dessert, and it makes for a great sipper. And contrary to some comments made by others, I found the stout thick, like a few stouts that have been condensed. As for price, I've become more accepting. I would not be willing to pay $8 for a 6 oz pour at a bar (unless I was already drunk), but paying $5 or $6 per 12 oz bottle seems an acceptable transaction. (As for the ""hazelnut"" variant, I'd rather a few Guinness.)",4.74
KBS - Maple Mackinac Fudge,"Pours a thick dark brown with a tight, small cappuccino head.

Big aroma on this beer. Sweetened coffee, chocolate. Some maple as it warmed. A little indistinct booze.

The taste follows, but fuller. Creamy sweet coffee. Milk chocolate. A hint of maple. Alcohol.

Body is on the thinner side despite the rather thick looking pour.

This is a great variant of the original, a beer I like quite a bit. Given the choice between a KBS and this, I might choose this one.",4.35

A: Pours nearly black with a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a light layer and leaves some very nice lacing.

S: Decadent chocolate fudge, some coffee, roasty earthy notes, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, and faint oak, and hints of toasted coconut.

T: Big chocolate fudge runs the show up front, followed by coffee, vanilla, smooth bourbon, brown sugar, a touch of maple, roasty earthy notes, and faint hints of toasted coconut and oak.

M: Medium to full body, mild carbonation, creamy smooth, alcohol is nearly completely hidden, crazy drinkable for a sweet 11%.

O: The second I heard about this beer it topped my wants list, so it's nice to finally dive into a bottle.
I really grew to appreciate this one the more it warmed and opened up. It's a big sweet dessert stout, the first few sips make that very clear, and they absolutely nailed the fudge factor. It's also surprisingly easy to drink for something so big and sweet, which I came to realize is due to the solid foundation of coffee that kept peeking out more and more as my glass emptied. Is it my favorite form of KBS, probably not. But it makes a fantastic desert beer.",4.4

Despite all that, I can settle myself and dig in. As I do, here in this 8 ball black, short mocha headed ale, I get chocolate raspberry sticks and not a ton of barrel. There's just a little bite of slightly herbal wood, which I think more than anything helps to bring us to a powder dry finish.

I can see how this would have made the news in its heyday (see what I did there?), but in today's world of absolute confections and bombastic feats of oak, it's quite underwhelming.",4.04
Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Part of the wonderful deluge of midwest goodies sent my way by @FBarber during NBS BIF #13.

Gorgeous pour. Body traps light. Completely dark. Lovely finger of soft dark brown foam. Quite the beaut.

Nose has lovely rich velvety espresso with vanilla and milk chocolate and sure enough there's a hint of raspberries layered in there as well. Inviting.

The berries are much more prevalent here, beginning at the first sip. It starts off as just kind of a general berry/fruit sweetness that builds alongside the other components I will get to in a moment to reveal a jammy decidedly raspberry note. We'll come back to this later. The build alongside this has silky espresso and dark chocolate as well as a hint of vanilla and spice and oak from the barrel. This brings us back to the raspberry. You know how raspberries are actually kind of tart alongside their juicy sweetness? It's one of the great things about them, is they offer a balance and a range of experience, and that presents here. The finish has some bitter from the coffee, and a bit of pucker that feels like the raspberry tartness joining the oakiness of the barrels and a bit of alcohol astringency (that works well in this situation to accentuate the other flavours listed there) to give it a little 'ooh!' to the finish. Really enjoyable.

Body is velvety smoothe, and that tart finish I descibe above fades to leave behind some of the dark chocolate bitterness and a slight reminder of the alcohol contained therein. Would not descibe it as hot, but it isn't shy about it's double digit ABV.

I'm really enjoying this. Raspberry and chocolate are such a natural seeming pairing, but I feel like I still don't see it quite as often as I'd expect, in beer. I think it really really works well here, and am grateful to have had the opportunity to try it. Thanks Frank!",4.36

Clare's Thirsty Ale,"Appearance - Poured into a sampler, the beer was a murky deep black color with a dark tan head.

Smell - Raspberries were strong in the nose, paired with a definite bourbon presence.

Taste - Raspberry is tough to capture in a beer. The raspberry seemed fresh, without overdoing it or making it seem artificial. The sweetness is balanced by roasted malts and a little bourbon sting. The finish was slightly warming, though never overly sweet.

Mouthfeel - Before there were slushies with gobs of fruit puree, Haymarket made a nice thick stout with fruit.

Clear, medium gold colored body. One finger of white head sticks around as rising bubbles replenish. Slight strings of lacing.
Aroma is a complexity of funk, fruit and oak. The funk is musty and hay-like, the fruit is remindful of green apples, and the oak adds to both the slight sweetness and the tannins.
Taste is also complex, and sour in tone. The mustiness comes through in the funk notes, and the fruit has green apples that add to the sour tone. Big oak underlay. Rather quick to disperse and dry. The fruit funk lingers.
Mouth feel is light and substantial at the same time. Bubbly, and high in carbonation.

Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Frustrated. Lost my review three damn times due to page crashing. Now this will be a short review for a phenomenal tasting, which is annoying.

Pours a honeyed golden orange. No real head to speak of, but a nice white ring surrounds the glass.

Complex nose that you need to smell yourself to truly experience it. Fruit notes of green apples, pears. Funky notes of general barnyard stuff, hay, some musty notes in there as well. Somewhat of a vinous smell, generic dark wine grapes here. Some wooden and oaky aromas. The smell is not an unrestrained Brett/super barnyard funk that smells like a horses barn that hasn’t been cleaned and smells like crap, and it’s not sour vinegar-y either. It’s even mildly sweet.

Taste of apricots on the sip that morph into a green apple flavour. Some dried lemon and tangerine peel notes here, I think it’s the drying effect on your palate that give me that impression. Ever spritz a citrus peel and lick the peel itself? That kind of oily flavour is here, but it’s miles more gentle. A little bit of wheaty notes here as well, like some damp, whole wheat bread made with sprouted grains or something. Vinous character at times, like generic white wine grapes. It sort of dances between a lot of different flavours, and yet all of them meld together on each sip. It’s more like, on a particular sip a certain dancer does their solo before blending back in. It’s pretty remarkable all things considered. Some gentle leather like flavours that are sometimes accompanied by… a mild smoke flavour? I might just be shooting blanks here, but it feels like it. There is not, well… I don’t think it’s a savoury character to this. But there is this kind of umami flavour to it. Sort of like the character of blue cheese or yogurt, that sort of body. It’s not oily, particularly, because the sourness makes it more tart than anything. It’s really hard to nail down this character, especially as it warms and it comes out even more. Thankfully… I have another in the cellar!

Definitely sour, but not a puckering sour. There is even a mild sweetness. It finishes pretty dry, and surprisingly, finishes quite clean as well. No lingering sourness on the palate. Maybe some very mild fruits and the slightest hint of sweetness, which is really unique from a lot of sour beers I’ve tried. Good carbonation that creates a smooth sip, the carbonation is not particularly biting. Medium bodied.

This is my first real Geuze. I’ve had plenty of sours, but not a Geuze as of yet. And I’ve had plenty of terrible farmyard funky sour vinegar bombs that taste like they added 10 gallons of brettanomyces. This is not that. This is balanced, restrained and yet complex. For what the style is, it feels like an absolute benchmark. I am by no means an expert in this arena, but this is quite an experience for any beer drinker. My bottle was bottled early 2018. Which made this about 4 years old when I drank it. I have a second one I plan to age for another 4 years or so! Can’t wait to revisit it! To tide me over until then, I have many other 3 Fonteinen beers to try… the framboise may be next!",4.55
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a foggy, hazy burnt orange with a half finger of white fizzy foam. Head bubbles away quickly. Aroma is peach and apricot for fleshy fruits, but not overly juicy. It adds just a touch of initial sweetness. Stone, grass, and oak round it out. It has a slight tart funk to it, but is not 'sour'. Acidity remains balanced, and low. Flavor profile is stone, oak, grass, herbal, peach and faint apricot. It leads with that heavy stone, grassy, yeasty character, with a little build up of fruits at the finish. Tartness remains light or faint, offering just a touch of dynamic at the end. Acidity is low. Mouth feel is still in effervescence with just a little sparse pulp for any additional texture. Thickness is medium. Overall, a sublime lambic that packs elegance into every sip.

A: pours a deep burnt orange with a couple fingers of frothy tan head that faded away into a thin bubbly collar with soapy lace.
S: musty earth/wood, bright acidity, mild citrus, wood, grain, and apple notes.
T: follows the nose with musty/damp flavors and soft citrus, with the addition of darker grain/dark bread flavors. I get a touch of dark fruit followed by a cider-like note in the finish and apple skins in the aftertaste. There’s a earthy spice throughout along with a lingering funk to the aftertaste.
M: frothy, creamy carbonation complimented by acidity that is sharp but quick. Medium body with a little chew to it. Not bone dry or thin. Acidity lingers but this drinks well. But if you want a few of the last sharp corners rounded off, give this a few more years of age. This is still pretty bright for 5 years.
O: I had to pop a bottle on the day of Armand’s passing and felt this was a good fit. A lovely beer, just like the lovely man I hear Armand was. Fuck cancer; rest in piece.",4.26
Oude Geuze Cuvée Armand & Gaston,"Pours a cloudy opaque brownish tinged orange color. Very thin, fleeting off-white head appears as the beer is poured, but dissipates almost instantly. The aroma on this is very complex - there is a moderate funkiness on the nose that is immediately noticeable. Notes of tart green apple, white grapes, oak, dirty laundry, and a zippy lemon character.

The taste leans into the funk without as much of the tartness. There are notes of green apples, apple, lemon, some bleu cheese notes, strong oak with some mellow white grapes, wet blanket funkiness and some dry tannic notes. I feel like I get something else every time I take a drink of this beer. At times its funkier, and times it more fruity and tart, then it is drier and leans into that chardonnay like character. The complexity of this is amazingly balanced by a drinkability I have rarely found in these geuzes. I could actually envision drinking this all afternoon rather than just a single glass - although my heartburn would undoubtedly make me regret that. Still, this is a beautiful beer - complex, yet approachable.

The feel is medium bodied with bright, vibrant carbonation. The tartness in this dances up to the point of being puckering without ever actually reaching that point. It is definitely a drier beer especially on the back end into the finish.

Overall its a remarkable beer - delicious, complex, challenging, yet oddly drinkable. A fitting beer to carry the name of Armand Debelder",4.57

A- pours a clear golden amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention

S- bright and fruity nose with aromas of ripe pear, green apple, lemon peel, orange marmalade and white grapes. Plenty of funk undertones provide aromas of oak, barnyard funk, wet hay, fermented apples, leather and cracked pepper

T- fruity notes of ripe pears, green apples, lemon pith and citrus zest up front, followed by a backbone of funk, providing notes of hay, lemon tartness, yogurt and some barnyard funk. The finish is fruity and funky, with notes of more pear and lemon, funky linger

L: Pours a lovely clear burnished bronze-gold, and forms a thick, fluffy white head with great retention.

S: Funky, mildewy old dried hay, with sourdough biscuits being baked nearby, and some moldering orange peels.

T: Sharply tart underripe citrus opens, with a soft metallic tinge. That quickly segues into a swirl of sour white grapes, vinosity, green apple, and rancid honeydew melon, with a grass and mildew undertone. Old wood and pollen manifest by the finish, the aftertaste of which lingers as tart sour orange with mold and metal.

Double Stack,"Pours a deep brown/black color with a thick tan colored head that sticks around and has some nice lacing down the glass. This beer smells like maple pancakes and a cup of coffee from a serious distance. Up close it's fresh maple, a great cup of coffee, and somehow the sweetness of pancakes.

Wow.

Mouth feel is thick and silky. Not one to have multiples off.
Great beer for the style",4.6

Double Stack,"Beer #1600 on BA is another beauty.

Brew #8 from the Hop Culture Juicy Brews box, a 16oz can poured into a glass coffee mug.

A: Moderately thick black pour; certainly dense and opaque but not the thickest stout ever. Capped by a creamy mocha head.

S: Delicious, decadent, rich coffee and maple syrup character. Chocolatey notes as well. The coffee isn't acrid or bitter, just smooth and rich and plays well with the maple syrup sweetness.

T: Yeah, so easy to drink - this is literally my wheelhouse. Just enough sugary maple syrup to be rich and decadent without being cloying; roasted malt profile bolsters up that sweetness, and the fresh coffee shines through with a breakfast-y feel to it.

MF: Again, not the biggest stout I've seen or tried but big enough, and the body stands up to the adjuncts.

O: Just delicious and darn near perfect for a maple syrup coffee stout.",4.47
Double Stack,"Appearance - The beer poured a brown-ish black color with an off-white head crowning the pour.

Smell - Maple syrup stood out in the nose but there was some bitterness to lend a sense of balance.

Taste - The maple was huge, complemented by a dry bready backbone. A bit of charred dark coffee lent a sense of balance. The sweetness fades in the finish leaving a light coffee bitterness.

Mouthfeel - The body seemed a bit thin for a sweet stout, but it had stickiness.

Overall - The nice thing about this mapled stout was that it was not too heavy.",4.46
Double Stack,"Brownish black with two fingers of brown foam. Smell and taste are clones: huge maple syrup from the local diner with coffee bean, mild chocolate, brown sugar and molasses. Reminds me a lot of Mikerphone's imperial SLBS extra maple variants. Feel is lighter and not syrupy at all though, roasted and malty if anything, amazing given the huge maple presence. Would love to try this in a barrel! A classic that is worth the hype for a great maple fix without saturating the palate with sweetness",4.49

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout,"Big 750ML bottle that’ll make quite a crash in the recycling bin. Split with my wife. Because I’ve had my sugar quota for the week.

Lab black, little to no head. Smell like an Oompa Loompa is holding my face inches from a small pond of chocolate. Overwhelming.

Imperial German Chocolate Cupcake Stout is sweeter than my Grandma (no, not really, nothing sweeter than Gen! Plus, she made killer buns). Wow. The cocoa. And this from a confirmed chocolate addict. All the chocolates. Vanilla shows after a good spell of warming along with a smidge of coconut. No toast. Nothing to offset the ridiculous sweetness. Full, big, but a small sample of this would have left me content. 75 minutes in & not half done.

The barrel aged version was superior: the bourbon & oak seem to have cut the overwhelming sense of being trapped in a silo of raw sugar. Good but would be much better in small quantities.",3.55
Reaction State,"Outstanding beer. Standard stout appearance. Smell presents with barrel and maple first, while coffee, vanilla, and cocoa provide a subtle background. Same notes on the taste with an additional cinnamon bite, very well balanced. A slight oiliness and thickness, medium to big body, boozy. I’ve always wanted to try one of their barrel aged stouts. This did not disappoint.",4.71
Reaction State,"Appearance - From the bottle, the beer poured a deep black color with dark brown bottles clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell - In the nose, the cinnamon lead the way with modest sweetness.

Taste - In the profile, coffee led the way. Cinnamon came in second place, and it was not overdone but gave a nice element of spice. I struggle to find a vanilla notes and the barrel profile was mild. The coffee and cinnamon carried to the finish.

Mouthfeel - The beer had some viscosity, allowing the main profile to linger.

Overall - This one was a bit of a letdown for me.",4.08

Double Dry Hopped All Citra Everything,"Very modest head production; decent retention. Lemon yellow body, opaque and murky but not unattractive or pulpy.

Fresh and hoppy nose, but a bit of a melange of citrus, tropical, and herbal aromas, with little in the way of individual notes to pick out. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, cream; little else that triggers anything. Still, it's a very pleasant, if not particularly complex, aroma profile.

Very juicy on the palate, with tropical notes leading the way, carrying a more restrained citrus edge and some herbal bite. Mango, papaya, pineapple, basil, oregano, lemon zest, mandarin orange. Orange creamsicle finish.

Smooth and creamy bite; top notch in the style.",4.38

M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. On the fluffier side

Thicket,"This one is really thick (unlike that loser Robin). Yeah, this one is like pure and ripe like the day Bridgette Bardot was born. For reals, it’s just beautiful and it hits you well and good like Bruce Smith trying to make you fumble.

Hut! Hut! Hike!",4.49
Thicket,"Blend No. 2 (2018 release); consumed on 1/14/21

Pours a deep, jet-purple body with an airy half-finger of extra-pale mauve head, retreating quickly to a few paper-thin, spotty islands of cap, a sizeable, bubbly collar, and virtually no lacing beyond an occasional splotching isolated at various points around the glass.

Aroma shows fresh blackberry pits engaging with an increasingly rounded lactic funk, sharpwning over time while simultaneously embracing jammy blackberry and a deepening sweetness as the beer warms; old leather and wet stone peak over the middle into fresher oak and some grape-like tannins to close.

Taste ooens with suggestions of blackberry quijcly overtaken by lactic funk and a splintery oak profile; hints of dried peppercorn pair with a sturdy tannic structure into a mid-palate of barnyard funk and lemon zest, while tones of blackberry pits, lactic funk, and a brief burst of red berries mark the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium-light body with a fine, moderate-mild carbonation; a huge acidity is sharp and biting over the mid-palate, acetic and puckering though crisp into back end; a brief juiciness dries steadily with slight tannic textures on the finish.

Increasingly palatable as it warms, an overwhelming acidity remains dominant, relegating the blackberry to an underdeveloped background while largely glossing over the nuance of the funk; this wild ale is clearly designed competently and shows sporadic sparks of genuine depth, but a relentless imbalance ultimately takes away from the overall product.",3.56
Thicket,"Batch 2 - 375ml bottle - poured into a zin stem at 45°F.

Pours a deep blackberry purple - foggy anf crimson when held to the light, with a lasting sudsy pinkish collar. The occasional rising bubble can be seen. Not as saturated, but quite similar to a merlot in appearance.

Nose: Really wonderful blackberry presence here. That classic, instantly recognisable Side Project grist and culture character forms a simple foundation, with some toasty grain, bright acidity, and white oak, with subtle threads of hay, wheat, dusty leather, stone, petrichor, wet leaves, and lemon. The fruit is fresh, vibrant, and seedy, with an underlying jammy element. Reserved, but elegant.

Palate: Thicket greets the palate with a sharp zing of acidity, with a ton of lacto-driven lemon juice pucker, and a bit of acetic bite following. Like many fruited Side Project wilds, there's an underlying sweetness that seems like it's from both the malt as well as some fructose. The sweetness tuns parallel to, but beneath the sourness, taming it a bit. The blackberry character is unmistakable, buy leans towards the dry, seedy, unripe, tart end of the spectrum, rather than juicy or saturated. The acidity is aggressive, and thankfully, burns fast and bright, settling down quickly, and revealing some grains and a bit of oak. Some ripe berry pokes through, along with some wine-soaked oak, finishing quick, clean, and dry.

Mouthfeel/Body: Thicket is medium-light in body, wispy, fluid, and crisp. Puckering acidity up front causes some mouthwatering. Effervescence is fine, lively, amd sparkly. The finish is dry, with some very subtle oak tannins.

Overall: This is one of those wild ales that could have been stellar if it wasn't so acidic. The reviews are polarising - some saying it's jammy, others, that it's crazy sour. As it warms, some ripe berry sweetness does begin to emerge, which helps a lot, and it does become enjoyable, but the aggressive acidity holds it back and stifles the complexity. It's certainly fruit-forward, and very much Side Project, but it isn't the most balanced or complex offering. This one is good, but not amazing.",4.03
Thicket,FFBL draft. Holy sour blackberries! This is what a sour is. I enjoy the thick and gloopy fruited stuff but this is a real sour. Tons of lacto on the nose and in the flavor. Nice blackberry flavor with a lot of sour. Puckering! Great fruited sour here.,4.34
Thicket,"Dark maroon to purple with a short mauve head that loudly fizzles out to nothing quickly.

Taste is super juicy blackberry, to the point of gummies, while dark oak and tannins come in mid-palate, capping off with only the faintest hint of nutty funk in the exhale.

Thicket is really puckering and tingly, yet somehow not painfully acidic at all. A playful effervescence runs thru the medium body coming to a just semi-dry finish.

Blend #2",4.14
Bomb!,"Simply a perfect beer. First the history- Prairie Bomb! changed the alcohol laws in Oklahoma to open up the door for higher alcohol content beers and a wave of new craft breweries. The complexity is incredible. In this style it is so hard to hide the alcohol content. Prairie does this well. Slight chili taste in the end keeps it from tasting too sweet. Also stands apart because of the carbonation. Slight bubbles, small head are a delicate balance which is also hard with this style. Appropriately named, this one will sneak up on you. Best beer from the best brewery in Oklahoma. Period.",4.99
Bomb!,"12 oz bottle into a Firestone Walker snifter. 13% ABV. Looks like it was bottled in June 2022, but that’s a guess through a clump of yellow numbers on the bottle neck.

Smell is milk chocolate, plum, vanilla.
Tastes great. The chocolate and vanilla play nice and Satan sends a small heat spear on the tongue and back of the throat at the finish. Balanced rolling flavor profile.

Moderate level of head, which is medium brown. It recedes into a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Nearly black and opaque, which pours somewhat thickly. Sweet tinged, heavily toasted grain/wood and chili pepper on the nose. Not very sweet, smooth caramel and toasted wood flavors, with the added chili, cocoa, coffee and vanilla bean, blending into a subtle and singular note, which is really well done and probably not very easy to balance together and not become the main flavor component of a beer. At the very tail end of the finish, there is a bit of coffee, on the palate.",4.24

I strongly enjoy beers that are ""different,"" and this is nothing like I have ever tasted.

I had no idea how really good this beer would be. Pours a totally dense black color with no light coming through. Surprising medium size dark tan/brown head with, what I would consider, a very long lasting head for a 13% abv beer. Aroma and taste have it all for a stout. Rich malty presence, strong coffee and chocolate presence, a little vanilla (good for me since I don't like prominent vanilla in my stouts and porters). I may have picked up some mild chili peppers in the first taste, but not after that. Mouthfeel is rich and fairly smooth, but with a little alcohol ""bite"" as befits the high octane.

Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"Lift Bridge Silhouette Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. 2014. Bottle Number 239. 750 ml. 1 Pint, 9.4 fluid ounces. Alc. 10% by Volume. Aged in bourbon barrels. Brewed and bottled by Lift Bridge Brewing Company in Stillwater, MN, USA. ""The Cold War is over. Serve at 55-60. Degrees. (I still don't know the key for that one.) I will skip the the gobbledygook until later.

(Note: this is one of those very rare occasions when I don't have a photo of the beer I consumed to go along with the notes. I plugged in the iPod touch that use to take them and found nothing. How is this possible? It's part of my regular routine, I never forget to take the pictures. Could I have accidentally deleted them somehow? That's even less likely. Perhaps I was just so excited to drink the beer that I forgot to take that essential early step in my ritual. So, once I realized there were no photos, I fished the empty bottle out of the recycling, and posed it next to the as yet un-washed glass I drank it from. That's not even the true beer in there, I followed Silhouette with another bottle.


I bought this two weeks ago at the brewery. Wish I had another to save and age and savor in the future, but this is the one, and I'm drinking it now. (I'd actually never even heard of this beer, must have been sleeping or something when it was released last year.)


Solid blackness in this one (the darkest beer I've had from this brewery), with a rich, roast tan head that starts big, slims down and stays awhile.

Aroma leaps out and spills the bourbon all over the place. Additional notes of charcoal, molasses, caramel, toffee, dark fruit, …vanilla. Always vanilla. And I like it.

Taste: Ah, mmm, and yeah, huh. Deepness and richness in abundance. This has got everything it needs and it lasts and lasts. Immensely indulgent. Chocolate and espresso and everything dark and deep and delicious. MMM, I'll say it again. And what else? Licorice. We call it anise sometimes. And all those other things.

It's a thing of hugeness and a richness and wonderfully rewarding to the drinker. this is all relative. I am loving this and this is not a chore at all, it is a delight. If you want to read about a chore, check my review of Stone's Crime and Punishment. Yikes, talk about trial and error!

Hey, let's read the gobbledygook. ""Silhouette is as deep and dark as the Northern woods. It's brewed in the style of an Imperial Stout. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, molasses and prune meld with a unique dark roasted character. . The beer is complex, rich and full bodied. It's wild spirit will warm the senses, illuminate the soul, and grow into a traditional favorite…no matter what season.""",4.4
Barrel-Aged Silhouette,"2020 bottling, 12 oz bottle.

I walked on by this beer many times in the store because I considered it to be overpriced (yeah, I know... it's a ""99 World-Class"" here, but we're suckers for a BA Imperial stout...).

Anyhow, in a weak moment, I did order one from my favorite curb-side pickup store a while back, and it sat in my 'fridge, and sat, until I finally moved it to the cellar to make room for other beers.

It's back in the refrigerator for Cellaruary.

So, today is the day. I won't be able to compare it to the beer fresh, though, since this is my first tasting of this beer.

Taken from a ~42° refrigerator and allowed to warm for 30 minutes or so unopened. Drinking started at mid-50°'s (a guess).

Opaque black topped by a ½ inch creamy-appearing dark tan head with short retention. Little visible carbonation and what lacing does appear with a tip of the glass quickly slides back down into the tan ring. The ring eventually disappears completely, leaving a still surface.

Very strong aroma. Bourbon first, then barrel. Molasses. Slight hint of vanilla.

Rich flavor, mirroring the aroma. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet molasses. Adding to the party is roasted malts and dark fruits. Toward the finish and into the aftertaste, dark chocolate appears along with the alcohol, slightly warming my mouth in the after. The finish is sweet vanilla and dark chocolate.

The body is substantial, approaching viscous (but not quite getting there).

Overall, this BA stout is excellent, indeed. A rich aroma and flavor, a substantial body, lots of bourbon and barrel without overpowering the underlying Imperial stout flavors, a sweet, but controlled sweetness, finish. It's not a dessert beer, but an excellent evening sipping beer. If I'm feeling like splurging, I may actually buy it again!",4.45

Smell- Very fragrant, black currant, tobacco, plum, blackberry, black cherry, brett, oak, black licorice.

Taste- Black currant, black pepper, brett, plum, blackberry, black cherry, transitions during the sip from sweet/sour to just sour.

Feel- Between medium and full body, very mouth watering upfront, highly dry at finish, soft, silky, sour finish, moderately mouth coating, below average carbonation.

Overall- Highly complex beer with an abundance of flavor and a powerful bouquet. Nice balance of plum, black currant, blackberry, and black cherry made for a wonderful experience.",4.46
Consecration,"Received via NBS BIF #13 from @Jayorear.
Poured brown with tints of red, the beige head grew to about 1 cm and settled to a thin film leaving no lacing.
Aroma had red wine vinegar and, oddly, red wine (I mean, how do they get both of those aromas to come through?)
The taste, wow. Oak, funky red wine vinegar and, at the edges, dry red wine. Faint but unmistakable. The flavors play off each other in every sip.
The feel is medium with very active carbonation. Fits well with the flavors.
Thanks Jay, this was amazing!",4.39
Consecration,"Re-reviewing this one (7/1/2022) now that I have an additional decade of beer tasting experience (and, consequently, several additional pounds) under my belt.

375mL (bottled 7/12/2021) into a tulip. Pours a clear amber/mahogany with almost zero head, lazy carbonation rising from the bottom.

Aroma is acidic and vinous, tart and bright. Bready caramel malt, oak, apple cider vinegar. The yeast is clearly doing the heavy lifting here.

Taste is likewise sour and fruity with lots of red wine character. Oak barrel, wild yeast, clean malt, tannins. Complex and delicious.

Mouthfeel is crisp and light, hiding the relatively high ABV. Finishes clean and dry, super refreshing.

Overall an excellent, well constructed wild/sour ale. Seems pretty straightforward but it’s one of those beers that is deceptively simple. Clearly a great deal of skill and artistry went into producing this. It’s reputation is well deserved.

750mL bottle (batch 003X3) poured into a snifter. Pours a clear mahogany with minimal head, champagne carbonation. A ring of bubbles forms around the edge of the glass.

Aroma is tart cidery funk w/ bright notes of sour fruit and oak. A slight solvent aroma lingers.

Taste is tart, sour, oaky and fruity. Lots of wine notes, really dry on the palate. Almost a combination of a lambic, cabernet, and champagne. Really interesting beer to pick apart; complex.

This is not a beer I would drink every day, but definitely worth revisiting once in a while.",4.41
Consecration,"375ml bottle, tulip, bottled 2/26/20.

There’s a little fizz as I pour, but my attention quickly shifts to the eye catching dark amber liquid. It has a viscose appearance, bubbles move slower, like a hardening piece of amber, and there’s a notable lack of foam.

It’s funky, naturally. Lacto sourness, copper, and the currants come through with their gamey, deep fruitiness.

Moderate tartness before moving on to a schmorgasbord of funk, leather, barrel, dry red wine, and those delicious little berries.

Light body, practically no carbonation, and just a little slick.

When I picked this bottle up last year I was surprised I hadn’t had Consecration. It’s just a super well done beer.",4.31
Consecration,"Brief Review:

O: So this is my first time with any of the RR sours. Right away, I don't see too much as to why this is so special or a top 250 beer. I've had many sours and Cab-aged sours that are similar to this. Don't get me wrong, it's a fine beer. Very complex and deep and the barrel is done really nice. I can be maybe this being very pioneering back in the day, so maybe it's reputation precedes it. Just don't think in 2022 this can hold a candle to some of the wild ales from HF or SARA or even Bellwoods.

Recommendation: I mean, yeah, it's an RR sour from the -ation series, you gotta try it. Just don't go in expecting to get your mind blown. Hopefully the next two I have are better.",4.21
Consecration,"A friend of mine visited Colorado for a family Christmas and he brought back a bunch of RR goodies 12-31-21 including this 375ml bottle for $14.99. Bottled 7-12-21; consumed 5-3-22.

Beer poured a red wine color with a fizzy carbonated head that dissipated quickly.

Nose is cherry and strawberry forward and red wine barrel that gives a touch of leather.

Taste is a wonderful balance of leather, red wine vinegar, cherries and strawberries, finishing very clean with each sip.

Mouthfeel is light and delightfully smooth.

Overall a really well executed beer!",4.4
Consecration,"Bottled 7/12/21

I’m back with my next Russian River Wild. I had Temptation last week, and while I thought it was pretty good, it didn’t completely wow me. This one sounds like it’ll be more up my alley anyhow, so I have higher hopes here. This one currently sits at the 15th highest rated Wild Ale and 209th highest rated beer overall on BA. Let’s pop the cork and get to it

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves no lacing

Perhaps unsurprisingly, this gives off a huge Flanders Red/Brown vibe in the nose, and it’s quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of tart cherry, black currant, brown bread, red wine vinegar, sharp oak, toffee, raisin, and light leather

Oh man, this is rather unique in taste. It's so easy to lean too far into either funk or fruit with the style, but this one strikes an incredible balance and provides a dark wine character which hardly ever comes through this much. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting black currant, buttery oak, tobacco, leather, light lemon zest, red wine vinegar, and a touch of bready malt. The swallow brings notes of old leather, black currant, tobacco, brown bread, tart cherry, black pepper, red wine vinegar, toffee, sharp oak, and light vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a sharp yet gentle beer. Finishes a bit sticky but dries over time with a wonderful complexity. Drinks well under 10%

Well this was just awesome. I can see why this is considered a classic. I could have a cellar full of this and be happy. Cheers yall",4.5
Consecration,"Reddish brown liquid, off-white, slightly pinkish head that diminishes quickly. Dark fruit and oak fills the flavor profile, derivative of the Cabernet aging. A slight tartness like red wine vinegar, but also currants and berries. Delicious and complex, as the flavors unfold from first taste to finish.",4.5
Consecration,"I've had this beer since 2011 and it's from when they were still doing batch numbers rather than bottling dates.

A: Poured into a Russian River tion glass to a deep reddish brown beer which is topped by a dense bit of pinkish white head which fades to a collar around the edge of the glass
S: Smells of a really nice amount of tartness with some red wine vinegar notes, currants, and oak along with a touch of caramel.
T: Taste is red berries and currants with some nice acidity. Oak and red wine with some more berry fruitiness. On the swallow there's more red berries, currants, red wine, acidity and some lingering oak.
M: This beer has a body which is on the heavier side of medium. Carbonation is on the low end with a somewhat syrupy feel while the beer has a drying finish due to the acidity.
O: Overall this is an outstanding dark sour. Really nice flavors and complexity with a really nice amount of acidity to really round things out. I wasn't sure how well this one would have held up but it's an incredible drinking experience.",4.75

Russian River Brewing
Date: 05 November 2020
Another sour today, but this one is aged in wine barrels with currants. Pulling the cork carefully, then a loud pop, followed by mist. The beer is 48 degrees, and I served it my Stone RIS tulip. The pour created a fizzy and airy off-white head with poor retention. No lacing on the glass after the quick dissipation. The color is a combination between maroon and mahogany with brownish hues. This beer is translucent, with a few carbonation bubbles present.

The aromas in the beer are vinous, fruity, sour apples, oaky, funkiness, earthy, horse blankets, biscuit, bready, and a slight hint of pharmaceutical.

The flavors are oaky, earthy, funky, lightly toasted malt, brett, sour apple vinegar, bready, a hint of floral esters, vinous, stone fruit, tart cherries, and danky.

The mouthfeel is dry, tannic, and puckering

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonation, and lingering finish.

This sour is wonderful all the flavors in the beer create this harmonious blend of flavors. The wine barrel aging gave the beer depth and complexity. Stellar beer!",4.41
Consecration,"Pours a deep amber with a cream colored head.

Sour and sharp with notes of leather and tobacco rounded by floral and wood.

Sour, leather, tobacco, up front with notes of citrus & lime. A sharp sour punch, finishes dry and woody",4.24
Consecration,"What else can you say about this? Lively, funky, bright, full flavored, complex, refreshing... This is a great sour ale with a beautiful amber russet color. Carbonation is moderate and provides nice effervescence. The taste follows the nose perfectly with currant and bretty funkiness. So easy to drink at 10% abv. No real rough edges here. An excellent beer that few would find controversial.",4.78
Consecration,"Shared bottle, RBNAG 2011. Barrel aged 6 months, with currants added. Reddish brown colour. Intense farmhouse aroma, sour fruit, oak and spices. Sour flavour, good but not impressive.",3.52
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Pours onyx black with a dark brown film atop, which results in a small layer of lacing at the rim of the glass.

Aromas on this are defined by complex flowery and spicy vanilla, bakers chocolate and lighter molasses among a well accentuated, toasty, oaken barrel.

The beer’s mouthfeel is rich and decadent, smooth and heavy with a fitting lower carbonation, which manages to develop a late effervescence, leading to a pleasant refreshment.

Tastes of milk chocolate, spicy molasses and toffee, together with a warming, weatherbeaten, yet elegant, sweet and flowery appearing barrel. Got an earthy coffee bean dry- and roastiness going on, gently balanced by lots of soothing whipped cream and chocolate cake. Finishes with a warming, sweet spiciness, lingering, licorice accompanied vanilla bean and more chocolate among an evenly spicy, yet toasty maintaining barrel dryness.

This got an A+ balance to it with a truly fulfilling mouthfeel and a well working adjunct, establishing a nice interplay with the prominent barrel in this. Well done!",4.25
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"31 May 2021 - Beer #245

Price: $18.00 at the brewery

It pours a viscous black color in the glass with a mocha-colored head. When poured cold, the flavor profile leads with chocolate wafer cookies, bourbon-vanilla heat, and rich dark chocolate. As it warms, the true complexity emerges. We taste and smell bourbon chocolate chip cookie dough, bourbon vanilla ice cream, tootsie rolls, and smooth chocolate syrup.

The vanilla addition serves to soften the bourbon and chocolate character of the base beer making the whole presentation more confectionary and decadent like chocolate vanilla syrup.

Appearance: 4 - definitely black, but poured a bit thin. Not much head.

Nose: 5 - oh my. No explosion in the nose, just smells very well blended and not too sweet.

Taste: 5 - hmm, really interesting. Not too much vanilla. The barrel really hits on the back end.

Mouth: 5 - much thicker than expected. Supremely smooth. Incredibly well crafted.

Overall: 5 - okay, I wasn't blown away. Could have used more vanilla, but I'm nitpicking.

Cheers!",4.94
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"This is probably only second to Good Morning in terms of stouts from Tree House. Luscious vanilla bourbon goodness that coats the tongue. This is rich and viscous, and as it warms the vanilla comes out. Each brewery has its own nuances, and this brew excels at showcasing the vanilla character, married to sweet and robust bourbon. Seek this out if you can!",4.74
Truth - Vanilla Bean,WOW! First of all it’s great to finally have Treehouse barrel aging their beer. They jump right in with this one and it is as good as anything I have had other than KBBS. Kudos!,4.83
Truth - Vanilla Bean,Full bodied...rich feel...sticky lace all over the glass...huge vanilla scent and flavor...mild barrel character and ridiculously smooth. Abv is there...a sure supper. This was really well made and am looking forward to more of their barre offerings if this is a hint of what is to come.,4.8
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Drank from a 12 oz. white wax dipped bottle purchased at Tree House Brewing Company, Charlton, MA
Served in a Tree House teku

Viscous, complete pitch black appearance. The dense, oily looking body was capped by a small film of coffee colored bubbles that quickly dissolved. A thin, lasting ringlet encircled the liquid.

The aroma was a bit underwhelming initially but improved dramatically after a few minutes. Fresh vanilla bean came through strong. Good amount of sweet, sticky caramel and toffee pudding notes too. Moderate bourbon presence. As the beer warmed, both the bourbon and the vanilla really intensified. Dark fruits were also apparent.

The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super rich, malty and robust. Nice roasted and caramel malt presence on the front end. Loads of fresh vanilla bean too. Moderately sweet. Dark fruits were detectable in the center. Bit of chocolate fudge as well. Bourbon barrel notes appeared as the beer moved along the palate and intensified on the finish. More lingering boozy bourbon, vanilla and sweetness after the swallow.

Outstanding mouthfeel. Rich, creamy and full bodied for the style. Super oily and dense on the palate. The liquid contained a finely bubbled, moderate effervescence that turned super frothy and smooth. After a few sips, the beer deposited a sticky film on my lips.

Tree House’s Blend Two was a big disappointment, but Vanilla Bean Truth definitely lived up to the hype. The fresh vanilla bean notes were intense but not overwhelming, and the bourbon presence was punchy though not overly hot or boozy. I hope these guys continue to releases more barrel-aged bangers like this.",4.91
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"I wish it had a bit more vanilla and roastiness on the nose, but the flavor is so exquisite that I forget all about it. It’s rich, vanilla frosting, creme brûlée, dark chocolate and finishes with oaky barrel char bitterness. It’s silky smooth, like all Tree House stouts, and there is no boozy burn. It’s the best Tree House stout I’ve had.",4.63
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Lived up to expectations. Perfect blend of a fantastic tasty stout with just the right thickness and sweetness. Vanilla is just noticeable to bring great balance to the marshmallow and bourbon taste. The bourbon is noticeable from sip one and comes alive with that awesome bourbon burn on the tongue more and more as it warms - but never overwhelms. Always smooth, always a great mouth feel. Can’t wait for the next TH BA release.",5.0
Truth - Vanilla Bean,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle (after 25 minutes of fucking with the wax thank you Tree House) into a stemmed harmony glass. Gotta keep it classy..

The pour is pitch black with a 2 finger effervescent milk chocolate head. The head quickly dissipates into a blanket of creamy foam. Doesn't leave any lacing but looks gorgeous after it settles.

The aroma brings notes of earthy oak, sweet bread, bourbon and vanilla before a wave of dark chocolate, coffee, and dark fruits.

The flavor is definitely stupid. Lots of bourbon and vanilla on the front, followed by a tidal wave of milk chocolate, dark chocolate fudge, chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream, caramel, sweet bread, and roasted coffee. There's some subtle notes of fig on the back. Wow.

The feel is about what you'd expect: Full-bodied and chewy as hell, creamy, syrupy and full of booze. One of the thickest beers I've ever drank. Ridiculous, but also extremely difficult to finish even a 12 oz pour.

Overall, this is the first BA stout I've ever had from Tree House, and...the 2nd they've ever brewed (not certain about that)? Regardless, it's pretty much what you would expect if you love TH stouts as much as I do. The bourbon is strong but never comes close to overwhelming the other flavors. Incredibly rich and full. The price point is hard to justify but it's absolutely worth trying if you can.",4.75
Permanent Funeral,"From a 12oz bottle, aggressive pour yields a foggy amber color with a big frothy head that faded to a cap, leaving some nice lacing.

Permanent Funeral,"This is a great Imperial IPA!!!! Such strong flavors and mouthfeel could easily be attributed an American Barleywine as well!!!! Poured from a 16 oz can into a pint glass, this beer featured a hazy but bright apricot color with a big foamy white head. Head retention was excellent and there were thick bands of foamy lacing on the glass. Aroma was strong and pleasant, mostly floral, aromatic hops and sweet caramel malt. Flavor was more of the same but with great bitterness and piney hops overtaking floral hops. Great balance between the rich sweet malt and the strong piney bitterness. Outstanding flavor. Mouthfeel was rich like an American Barleywine with both sweetness and bitterness featured. A great sipping beer!!! One of the best beers I have had in a long time!!!",4.32

Permanent Funeral,"Can dated 10-04-2021

Appearance: Fairly cloudy amber color with generous-sized, thick, off-white head that slowly faded. Nothing to change here.

Smell: Moderate pine aromas and mild sweet fruity aromas. There is a bit of malty aromas also present.

Taste: Some sweetish malt notes first show up with some faint pine notes followed by a blast of hop bitterness. The beer has that sweet taste i typically get when IPAs/IIIPAs hit 10% or more ABV. The beer has a fairly sweet initial taste which dies off with some lingering bitter hop notes.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium-bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good IIPA but too high in ABV for my personal tastes for an IPA/IIPA. I just find the malt sweetness a bit much in hop centric beers over 9.5% or so.",4.04
Permanent Funeral,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 10/04/21 Q0433""

Appearance: It has a murky orange and gold body with some shadows that are just barely visible through it. The head is large, thick, and white. The head has a consistency of whipped cream with tapioca-like bubbles. It has very good retention and lacing.

Aroma: There is a light floral aroma with what smells like a dusty orange hard candy. As a whole the aroma is pretty muted but ok.

Taste: The flavor kind-of mimics the aroma; up front there is this orange flavor which is slightly floral. Towards the middle it picks up a light pith character and a bit of sweet malt flavor. It finishes slightly floral.

Mouthfeel: Carbonation feels great. The beer has a medium-light pithy hop bitterness. The body is on the lower edge of medium and smooth. Drinkability is high.

Overall: The flavors and aromas seem good but they are a bit muted in the beer. The can states that this is a ""ALC 10.5% BY VOL"" and it does a phenomenal job of hiding the high alcohol content. The beer mostly tastes like a somewhat sweet orange hard candy which is interesting. It isn't the best example of an Imperial IPA but it is still worth drinking due to the high drinkability.

Permanent Funeral,"Picked this up at Hy-vee in Owatonna Minnesota. No canned on date.
Appearance: Pours a golden yellow orange color and fairly opaque with some visible sediment. Almost 3 fingers of snow-white foam. Great head retention and lacing down the glass once the foam dissipates.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and citrus including grapefruit and orange rind. Lighter melon notes are also present with tangerine and apricot. Caramel and cracker malts with a prevailing bitterness. As the beer warms grassy and flowery notes become more prominent as the beer warms with an accompanying dankness.

Taste: Holy Hops! Bitterness jumps out the glass and assaults the tastebuds. On the back end there is a pronounced overwhelming sweetness that really destroys the complexities of the malt backbone. Its hard to make anything out besides pine and grapefruit in the first few sips. More citrus notes arise after the first few sips including orange, mango, guava, melon, and lemon. Earthy grassy and floral notes also become more pronounced along with a present dankness. Maybe a subtle amount of cracker and caramel malts present, but the malt character is underwhelming.

Feel: Medium carbonation with enhances the bitterness. Mouth feel is thick and usually I wouldn’t associate juiciness and bitterness, but this beer seems to have both. Definite alcohol warmness and a bit of a boozy aftertaste as the beer warms.

Overall: This beer is solid, very complex and a lot of good flavors, but the sweetness is a bit overwhelming and doesn’t allow for other complexities to show. Also pretty expensive at $14 for a 4-pack of tall boys. I don’t think I would buy it again, but if it was offered to me I wouldn't turn it down and I’m glad I tried it.",4.4

Everett,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one from his strike during NBS BIF #15. 16oz can (dated 5/18/21) Poured into 16oz tulip. Poured the expected dense, nearly solid, black color with about an inch of tan head head that had decent retention and lacing.

The aroma had a solid, but not overpowering, amount of roast at the front of the nose, backed with solid grains, and just a bit of floral hops.

Similar on the tongue, a good blend of grain, roast, and soft, slightly grassy, hops.

The body was also about typical for the style, perhaps a touch fuller than usual, smooth, and had a dry, roasty finish that lingered.

Drinkability was very good, a nice sipper, and an easy quaffer at the same time.

Overall, a very nicely done brew. A must-try if you get the chance.",3.63
Everett,"Canned on 10/12/21 (best before 1/12/22); consumed on 1/19/22

Pours a glossy jet-brown body with chocolate/chestnut hues and capped with two fingers of rich, light mocha foam; excellent head retention leaves a slim layer of frothy cap, a moderate, creamy collar, and a near-comprehensive coating of mounded, webby lacing caked across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features an extensive malt char deftly interwoven with lager yeast and toasty brown bread as tinges of beechwood smoke and bakers chocolate over the middle engage minerality into the back end and hints of coffee on the close.

Taste shows touches of leathery char and burnt coffee upfront, with added nuances of bakers chocolate against a rounded lager yeast and a touch of minerality over the mid-palate; malt roast grazes the back end, while brown bread crusts and nutty coffee grounds offer a subtle inflection on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with a medium-full carbonation, a purely silky texture seeing a sinewy backbone weaving grit and char to pseudo-creamy sensations throughout the mid-palate toward a firm, drying, and persistently roasty back end to nimble harmony on the finish.

Lagery roast finds waves of smoke and silky chocolate undertones to fuse with an obsessive Hill Farmstead precision of texture, bringing the modesty of an American Porter to climax with detailed expression on an otherwise restrained medium.",4.4

Smell: lots of cocoa, coffee, toffee and brown sugar.
Taste: absolutely incredible! Perfectly balanced with a nutty malt backbone that stops just short of drifting into stout territory.
Feel: perfect body; thick but not chewy or overly sugary. Carbonation was on point and makes this eminently drinkable.
Overall: hands down one of the best--if not the best--porters I've had in a while. Would definitely seek this out as a winter-warmer, or after dinner drink. Best of all, the ABV is manageable and leaves room for another glass.",4.59

The taste is outstanding. Intense and complex. Dark chocolate, charred wood, malts, licorice, burnt toffee, dark roast coffee, and a bitter smoky flavor that becomes more intense on the aftertaste. Very smooth and well integrated. I really dig this one. Not surprised by the great ratings!

Everett,"Deep brown color where light will pass with a bright light. Minor beige head but it lasts. Nice ring lace.

Creamy, almost like milk, chocolate. Not very sweet though. No coffee.

Smooth and silky mouthfeel. Lower carbonation. There's a bit more bitterness than the smell suggests but it seems to come from hops not black patent malt as there's no burnt elements of coffee flavors. Rich sweet to semisweet chocolate flavor before the bitterness comes from the swallow.",4.49
Everett,"Poured from a fresh can into a tulip glass:

Appearance: really dark brown, verging on black, with mahogany lights. Thick beige head. Plenty of retention and lacing, with fairly persistent head.

Very roasty, warm and inviting with multiple layers of aroma: light milk chocolate underlain by mellow coffee.

Taste follows the nose: deep base of roasted malt, with some bitter chocolate. Coffee notes are very mellow with a hint of vanilla and hazlenut.

Medium-bodied with light carbonation and really nice mouthfeel. Quite a clean finish for a porter.with a relatively crisp finish for a porter.

Overall: Wow! A benchmark porter. The depth of flavour is incredible for a beer with no adjuncts at this ABV. Combined with lovely mouthfeel and a fantastic finish this is truly a world class porter.",4.93

Hill Farmstead Brewery
Date: 18 May 2021
I nearly fell out of my chair when I discovered I was given this beer. Hill Farmstead is on my shortlist for must-visit breweries. They have several beers I want to consume. They have a best-by date to drink: furthermore, I am sure it is okay; it is only a couple weeks past. The beer was carefully maintained to preserve its integrity of the beer. I poured into a Willi Belcher glass; the temperature was 46 degrees. A frothy and creamy three-fingered dark tan head was created. The slow dissipation left loads of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 24, dark oily brown. The appearance of the beer is beautiful.

Oh wow, the malty profile is vibrant and aromatic. I smell dark roasted malts, chocolate, medium roasted coffee, a hint of floral, leather, intense earthiness, and subtle char note.

Coffee and chocolate smack your tastes buds in the sweet spot. Dark roasty malts, toast bread, a touch of floral, a dab of Maillard, a tinge of char, tobacco, leather, earthiness, and a slight herbal note is what I taste next. The beer is a parade of flavors doing a technical difficult choreograph dance with precision on your palate.

The mouthfeel is a little bit bitter, with some creaminess followed by a skosh of dryness.

The body is medium, medium carbonation, and has a long and delightful finish.

One of the best porter I have ever consumed. It has all the great qualities of stout but in the porter style. I love the robust flavors and creaminess with the bitterness.",4.77
Everett,"16 oz can, canned 7/27, poured into curved pint glass. The aroma is chocolate, roasted grains, cold brew, maybe some cocoa powder. The taste is right in line. And it’s quite tasty. The feel is medium , carbonation low and smooth. Overall, an outstanding Porter worth tracking down.",4.38
Everett,"Canned 5/18/21. Poured into a tulip at ~45 degrees. Black as night, with a wonderful, dense beige colored head with good retention and lacing Looks amazing. Aroma is rich, sweet and malty.

Palate – 4 – Medium, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Very velvety mouthfeel. The first few swallows went from slightly sweet to very bitter with alarming swiftness, but then it seemed to smooth out, just ending slightly bitter in counterpoint to the initial sweetness. Predominant taste and odor are roasted malt and cocoa, with just a hint of a smoky coffee on the tongue. In total, particularly good porter.",4.24
Everett,"I received a can of this famous Porter from @Roy_Hobbs. Canned on 5/18/2021. Poured at 59° into a Willi Becher pint glass. It pours nearly black with very dark cola hues at the bottom of the glass when held to the light, with a large, fluffy, medium khaki-colored had and thick creamy lacing. It's a beautiful pour. Its fragrant nose features dark chocolate, cigar smoke, burnt coffee grounds and charred nuts. Wow, the taste is amazing! The initial chocolate malt sweetness is juxtaposed to acidic coffee (like it's from a Jersey diner), and bitter, earthy, nutty char. There is also strong tobacco. The blend and balance of flavors are exquisite. The mouth feel is rich and creamy - almost stout-like - with mild carbonation, and the 7% ABV seems perfect. Everett is highly drinkable but with excellent substance. This Porter is big and flavorful enough to pair with a fine meal of roasted red meat but you could easily drink a couple of pours casually. Everett's 100 Score is well-deserved. It's as good an American Porter as you'll have the great pleasure of drinking.",4.52

550ml bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to leave nothing behind

S- aroma is rich with chocolate, cinnamon and chili pepper up front, followed by undertones of creamy lactose, vanilla, toffee and brown sugar. The tequila barrel comes across as a mezcal-like aroma, with some oaky bourbon juice in the background

T- rich malty chocolate up front quickly gives way to cinnamon and pepper skin. Mid-palate brings out the barrel notes; tequila takes center stage, with some oaky bourbon complimenting. The finish gives more cinnamon and chocolate, with a linger of pepper and creamy lactose

M- medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel turns slightly creamy into the finish. Some pepper heat pokes through after the finish

O- the barrel combo works well with this one, well done",4.39
Leche Borracho,"Brew: Bottle Logic Brewing – Leche Borracho

Intro: 500 mil. poured into a tulip glass. Shared with a friend.

Appearance: Dark black color. Minimal head but some. Same with the lacing as we drank

Smell: Cinnamon up front followed closely with chili pepper, Bourbon brings up the back end.

Taste: Followed along with the smell. Little to no carbonation. Chili pepper is strong for my tastes.

Mouthfeel: Creamy but the chili holds that in check. Medium mouthfeel

Drink: Again, follows along with mouthfeel. I’ve had better and I’ve had much worse. It’s not my favorite selection from Bottle Logic

Conclusion: I’ve had several other Bottle Logic brews and this would not be in my top 4 or 5. It is mostly because of the chili pepper but that is personal taste. I am a big fan of the brewery, just not this particular beer. It’s still finely crafted and is deserving of the score given",4.56
Leche Borracho,"Purchased for $20 from a private collector. 3 year old 500 ml bottle from 2018 poured into a snifter. This is my first Bottle Logic brew, as I'm in Ohio so it's difficult to get California beer out here. Poured out thick and darkest brown with a quick and active head that bubbled up furiously for about 15 seconds then rapidly shrank into a ring around the bottle, then disappeared completely. The strongest scent coming up from this beer is bourbon, even though there's also tequila barrels at work. Also notes of vanilla, chocolate, and a little tingle on the nose from the ancho peppers. The scent is very strong and peppery, and threatens to singe my nose hairs if i inhale too deeply too quickly. Truly a delicious smell, very complex and tantalizing. There is a strong and sweet malt backbone to this beer upon first sip. It's very thirst quenching. After getting the rounded sweetness of the sugars and vanilla, cinnamon washes through my mouth, followed by the tequila and bourbon. It's funny, but i can definitely taste both the tequila and bourbon independently, and i didn't think i would be able to. Also a bit smoky. The pepper comes last, stinging the back of the throat and giving it a nice finish. Mouthfeel is definitely thicker and syrupy, with a nice douse of effervescence. Overall, the smell knocked my socks off. And the taste was very complex and layered. Although I wouldn't say this is one of my favorite beers, it's definitely the result of an interesting recipe and the chef certainly knew what they were doing, to allow all the various flavors to come out. So it's getting my top marks for being unique, an important quality i seek in beer.",4.9

Nose is earthy sugarcane, burnt brown sugar, molasses, toffee, some cinnamon, and vanilla

Taste follows suit with the addition of barrel notes, however subtle. This doesn’t drink like 15%. Very easy drinking, oily, smooth, and full. Excellent example of the style and an over expression of what can be done with it. Glad to have finally tried it. Cheers.",4.25

2019 vintage from pint growler filled at B&V. Poured into tulip glass.

Same as prior but this time appearance was much better. Huge tan head, tons of thick lacing. Same great smell, taste and feel. About as close to perfect as I can imagine.

Feb 2020 Review
2017 vintage from pint growler bottles at Barrels & Vines 18 months or so ago. Poured into a pint tulip glass.

Basically the same review as in the past. This is an incredibly delicious candy bar masquerading as a beer. Appearance is probably the only weak point. Huge coconut, cinnamon, toffee, chocolate, bourbon nose and taste. ABV is well hidden; this one can get you into trouble. Super creamy moist. Still pretty much my favorite beer ever except for the high ABV and, now, taproom only distribution.

June 2018 Update
Had a 2017 vintage from a 16oz growler poured recently at Barrels & Vines.

Very much the same as original review with cinnamon a bit more pronounced, slightly less alcohol but every bit as good as I remember. Maybe even creamier than I recal. A great beer. Have a few more 2017 in the cellar. Can’t wait!
Didn’t get any 2018 as it was taproom only release which wasn’t practical for a SE MI beer lover.

2017 vintage (orange ball).
Pours a dark brown with a small head that took some work. Minimal lacing, low carbonation.

Sweet smell with a delicious aroma I can't place. Maybe toasted coconut (which I don't normally like) with brown sugar. Definite booziness but very smooth nonetheless.

Sweet right at the start but chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, other spices combine with bourbon and oak. One of the more complex and wonderful tastes I've experienced. Maybe a bit on the sweet and boozy side but I love it. Gets better as it warms.

Mouthfeel is amazing. Substantial complexity with low carbonation that suits me just right. Like the taste, it gets better as it warms.

Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. Definitely a bit sweet but not overdone. The sugar and bourbon alcohol mix perfectly with chocolate, spice, vanilla and cinnamon.

Can't wait to age a bottle and drink another!",4.82
No Rules,"2016 vintage with the Purple Bowling Ball on the label, it pours pitch black color with a small tan/mocha colored head that faded faster then normal and left minimal traces of lacing. Nose is full of oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, dark fruits and chocolate milk. I didn’t detect any coconut but still found this to be very complex and enjoyable to inhale.

Flavor has a lot more dark fruit, toffee and sweetness to it like black cherry soda along with brown sugar and a melted Heath Bar. It almost borders on cloyingly sweet, but that aspect helps hide the 15% ABV. Like the nose I got of barrel or oaky notes, vanilla, bourbon, dark chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, light soy sauce, more dark fruits, cocoa powder, candy and chocolate milk. None of the coconut advertised on the bottle, but a dynamic profile that was a lot more balanced than I expected. A tad bit thin, even for a porter, and while it’s overall a very impressive brew it’s too sweet to drink a bomber by yourself as I struggled having it alone. A definite dessert beer to share with a few other beer lovers.",4.42

Space Trace,"2018 bottle, drank March 2021 out of an oversized tulip.

Look - poured with little head, quite dark and sludgy.

Smell - faint, maybe a little roasty.

Taste - a bit of coffee and dark chocolate but no coconut, the surprise was a chunk of something, must have been solidified coconut, that got trapped in my mouth and quickly dissolved. Nice taste, like it says on the bottle, like a chocolate cake, but I typically don’t like chocolate cake unless it’s tarted up with other stuff, and this was a straight chocolate cake taste. No alcohol or barrel to be found anywhere.

Feel - moderately thick.

Overall - a big let down for such an acclaimed beer. Firstly - I was most looking forward to that Bottle Logic Barrel and got none. Secondly, the chunk. Thirdly, the taste and smell didn’t jump out at me in any way. I mean, I didn’t NOT enjoy it, and it was cellared properly, but I’m just not feeling this one like other BLs.",4.07

Good and artful, but doesn't stand out in a huge way",4.2

Yellow Bus,"The beautifully foggy bright yellow body darkens to maize as it gets closer to the top near the short lumpy white blanket.

Quite tart, herbal and bright of stone fruity wonderment, this is very refreshing, lightly oaky, and faintly funky.

I'm so glad FOBAB could help me check a box I never in a million years thought I would.",4.3
Peche Du Fermier,"Pours bright orange with a foggy transparency. Head is a finger and a half of snow-white foam. A few particulates sit at the bottom of the glass, but not much after pouring the first half of the bottle into the glass. The level of suspended particulate changes when the last 1/5th of the bottle is poured into the glass- it develops a more murky appearance, with visible silt and particulate in the bottom of the glass. Aroma is immediate peaches, but they're soft and delicate. It leans slightly into tart, but is otherwise well balanced thanks to the subtle peach sweetness. Faint cellar stone, oak, and grass occupy the rest of the nose, rounding out the depth. Peaches seem to swell in intensity as the beer warms towards room temperature. Flavor profile leads with peaches again, but leans into tart more so than the nose. It's a pretty quick transition from sweet peach to tart fruits, cellar stone, grass, lemon zest, and soft wood. Front third is fruited, with the back third being all base saison. The middle is a blend of the start and finish. Just like the nose, the peaches swell up in intensity as the beer warms to room temperature, and with that, it brings those underlying tart qualities forward. Still no puckering sourness, but it does create more contrast between tart and non-tart. No puckering or tart finish, with the finale wrapping up with a moderate dryness. Mouth feel is medium in thickness. It nearly falls flat on the tongue, with the initial portion being crisp. Overall, peach addition is wonderful, with the rest of the profile being a steadfast, focused, and balanced saison. It's not overly acidic or tart, providing just enough tartness to offer contrast, without forcing it into sour territory.

Blend #2. Served in a 15.5oz Speigalau tulip from a 750mL bottle.",4.55
Peche Du Fermier,"Pours orange gold with a slight head that dissipates immediately. On the nose, faint peach, earthy funk, white pepper, and slight oakiness. On the palate, a little peach, white wine, pepper with a puckering sour finish. Medium bodied with high carbonation. Very refreshing! Overall, even though I expected a little more peach flavor, this is a very nice variant on a classic saison!",4.59
Peche Du Fermier,"750 mL bottle. Clear golden. Smells of peach and strong stone fruit acidity. Tastes of just about all stone fruit sourness. Sour peach. Oak. A little earthy and fruity yeast in the finish. Just about as sour as I can handle. Good peach flavor, but not much else to it.",3.43
Peche Du Fermier,"Blend 3, from bottle.

Deep yellow-orange (like a peach) color appearance with foam which quickly dissipates. This smells like peach already, but a lot of barnyard funk too in the aroma. Flavor is plenty fruity, with overripe peaches throughout. Tart and acidic (not as acidic as some of the other Side Project beers but more than most would expect). Tart and dry finish.",4.18
Peche Du Fermier,"Foggy dull burnt orange with a short but persistent white blanket leaving some solid sheeting with a tilt.

Having had a Framboise du Fermier earlier in the day, this has a relatively toastier sesame seed cracker malt and oak interplay that is likely assisted by not being anywhere nearly as sour. The frothy medium body is so much more balanced, with a just lightly tart herbal peach skin presence accented by a nutty funk.

This is actually delicate by comparison to FdF, and as such, so much more enjoyable. However, we also had a few de Garde brews before this, and the comparison to the kings of stone fruit out in the Pacific Northwest is a stark one, no matter how formidable the challenger.",4.3
Peche Du Fermier,"Pours a clouded orange color with a medium, froth head.

Smells of riper peaches, old wood and bread dough among a lighter, stony pith quality. Got a lighter glue and blue cheese funkiness underneath, giving the fruit in this a nice little twist.

Drinks light, with an omnipresent acidity, balanced by a higher, refreshing carbonation.

Tastes of sun ripened peaches, not yet to the point of getting jammy though, due to a present acidic sourness, hitting the palate uncompromising. Turns a tad effervescent then, with a noteable mineralic note, wrapped up by older, oaken wood, adding a pleasant, funk accompanied complexity to the flavors. Finishes calmer, with maintaining sweet peaches, building a well working counterpart to the teeth numbing sourness in this, which the peaches manage to overcome during the aftertaste.

Very well rounded, fruited sour with a great balance to it, pushing successfully further than most other AWAs.",3.92
CitraQuench'l,"Neon yellow hazy body with a white head and decent lacing. Big citra nose, pushes the citrus notes of lime and grapefruit far. Taste is much the same, decent bitters, but the middle is lighter in flavor, holding this back from meeting the hype.

The flavor lingers well after the sip with rich, chocolatey cookie flavors. The body is very full and creamy without ever being syrupy, leading to a very balanced finish.

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"Bottled on 1/10/2020; consumed on 1/29/2022

Pours an oily midnight-black body capped with a modest finger and a half of dense, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a paper-thin veil over an otherwise viscous void along with a large, creamy collar, and the occasional strand of webby lacing dotted around the walls of the glass.

Aroma opens to a healthy barrel char with tinges of ashen smoke advancing to black licorice before finding predominant, nutty bakers chocolate over the middle; dark cocoa is enhanced by subtle caramels as a medley of dark fruits enriches delicately savory, tannic qualities in the backdrop through the close.

Taste brings soft vanillins into black licorice as deep bakers cocoa waves wash over splintery barrel accented with dark fruit esters; whipped milk chocolate decadence on the back end finds spent coffee grounds and hints of bourbon underscoring the finish.

Mouthfeel shows a body on the heavier side of medium and a moderate-low carbonation, purely silky in texture with intensely focused consistency advancing to a creamy mid-palate engaging a rounded, sinewy grit; vaguely tannic leanings into the back end are masked by moderate warmth as a subtle dryness evolves through the finish.

An honest, old-school display of classic Russian imperial stout bittersweetness and borderline acridity, composed in masterful flux with a tame and well-integrated barrel; effortless despite these roastier leanings, this is another example of Hill Farmstead at a formulaic peak in composure.",4.26

Damon (Bourbon Barrel Aged),"500ml black waxed bottle poured into HF white etched logo Charente glass (aka wine stem ""bulb"" glass).

75th unique beer from Hill Farmstead.

bottled on date is Jan 10, 2020.

Appearance: black bodied stout. 1-2 fingers tall; medium brown head. Big loose bubbles break the head down into a thin cap that drops down to an uneven ring. Booze legs with each sip. spotty lacing on the side of the glass.

Smell: While taking the wax off the bottle, I could immediately smell bourbon! Nice bourbon note and heavy barrel char once poured into the glass. Chocolate and smoke.

Taste: Bourbon leads this beer with a nice sweetness and the bourbon is also lightly spicy. Dark fruits, brown sugar, molasses, & moderately roasty malt profile. Tobacco and leather. Smoke, peat moss, and ashen barrel char begin to build after each consecutive sip; deep earthy and woody character as well. Umami richness in the middle of the stout. Light oxidation notes in the form of soy sauce; it's very faint and does not distract from anything here. Meaty smoke and peat moss finish that lingers for a little while after each sip. Unique flavors here that I don't taste very often in barrel aged stouts; it's rich with mature barrel notes without being overly sweet. Complex. Interesting. Well done bourbon barrel aged stout by Hill Farmstead.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied stout. Low and adequate carbonation levels. Creamy carbonation. Smooth and rich texture. It's not motor oil and its really great exactly where it is... in regards to this stout's texture. Damon is not at all boozy, but it does have a noticeable warming presence. This stout actually drinks heftier than the 10.5% abv & I do not mean this in a bad way at all. It's a really robust bourbon barrel aged stout and the texture lends itself to this without being abrasive at all. The beer remains smooth from fridge temperature all the way to room temperature. I solo domed this bottle and drank it over the course of two hours, it retained smooth sipping status the entire time.

Overall: Well, this beer has eluded me for a really long time. Really excited for the opportunity to finally get to drink it and see what it's all about. I got to try port Damon back in July of this year and I think that I prefer the port barrel version just a little bit more than the bourbon barrel. Hill Farmstead stouts always tend to distinguish themselves from the crowd. It shows that a stout does not need to be sweet to be rich especially when the stout has such great texture.",4.49

Aurelian Lure,"Hazed golden straw with a finger-and-a-half of near-white foam head with tightly knit bubbles. Some modest, sloppy lacing clings to the sides of the glass before sliding back down into the crown and wisp.

Refined barnyard aroma with hints of hay, lemon and apricot fruit roll-ups.

Delightful taste of super-juicy dried apricot layered over a slightly sour, slightly funky barnyard-and-lemon base. There’s maybe a little white wine. Maybe a little oak. The tartness and acidity comes in on the backend, and is somewhat lighter than I expected. Really superb.

Soft, mildly creamy mouthfeel with tight carbonation.

One of the juiciest, softest-feeling sours I’ve had the pleasure of drinking. The acidity really isn’t over the top at all. I love this.",4.39
Bad Boy,"Pours a nice clear golden color with a nice head and lacing
Aroma has generous floral and hoppy hints
The taste follows the nose with a very well balanced floral and hoppy flavors
A medium bodied well carbonated beer
A great IPA",4.68
Bad Boy,"From a month-old pint can, pours a very clear deep orange-gold. Smell and taste are very herbal and piney, with a touch of citrus. Bracing bitterness, but not excessively so. A big, unapologetic West Coast IIPA. Fantastic beer.",4.5
Bad Boy,"Nearly clear bright yellow brew with a thin cap of foam. Robust mouthfeel with super-sized malt. Aroma is mango. Flavors of dark orange, even some grapes. Rich and powerful with hot citrus.

Quite alcohol tasting. Boozy, as someone noted. Overall, this is a pretty no-nonsense blast of hops. I have never seen this in the San Diego area, and here it is at a supermarket in San Francisco. From the 22 oz bottle.",3.64
Hold On To Sunshine,"16 oz can poured into a pint glass. Pours black with a nice head. Nice peanut butter backbone running through this, to compliment the overrriding chocolate flavor. Reminds me of an imperfect peanut better cup. Very enjoyable stout.",4.56
Hold On To Sunshine,"6 months old. Can to tumbler.

Look: Pours pitch black with a full but patchy dark brown head that dissipates quickly. A lot of very fine floaters visible.

Smell: Peanut butter and milk chocolate combined with some roasty hints. Almonds and tobacco appear as the beer warms.

Taste: Peanuts, chocolate and coffee. Slightly sweet, somehow roasty and minimally bitter.

Feel: Creamy and oily with a clearly present carbonation. Quite smooth.

Overall: No barrel-aging, no double digit ABV, but still a fantastic stout with a classic flavor combination. All flavors are incorporated very nicely resulting in a great balance and a smooth drinkability. There are plenty of chocolaty peanut butter stouts out there but this is clearly the best one I‘ve had so far.",4.59
Hold On To Sunshine,"Viscous and oily looking with light brown foam that settles into a thick ring with a few patches of lacing. Chocolate malts, lactose, Cocoa, and a bit of dry roasted peanuts. I’m not a huge fan of lactose in general, but here it does ok. Well carbonated and creamy. Overall really tasty, but not mind blowing in any way. I would definitely buy it regularly if it was available in my area.",4.34
Hold On To Sunshine,"16 oz can poured into a tulip pint glass. Pours pitch black with a surprisingly large mocha head. Good retention. Aroma and flavor feature dark chocolate, creamy peanut butter, dark roasted malts, bitter coffee, vanilla, and some earthy hop presence. This has to be the perfect peanut butter cup beer: not too sweet, real peanut butter flavor, not too strong abv-wise. Mouthfeel is thick, creamy, and not boozy. Overall it's a shockingly good beer and a real treat to drink.",4.67
Hold On To Sunshine,"16oz can received as a gift from a friend. Indicates YEAR THREE on the can with a date of 1/7/22, so this is being consumed at just after 3 months.

Look: Pours out very dark brown almost black with a deep brown colored, frothy head. The head dissipates pretty quickly but leaves a thin layer behind. Looks stunning.

Smell: The aroma is wonderful. This smells like a dark chocolate peanut butter cup. Notes of roasted hazelnuts and charcoally coffee also. There's even a subtle green bell pepper and licorice aroma on the finish, which is very interesting for a milk stout.

Taste: Interesting. It is much sweeter than I was expecting. And that's appropriate, because this is a milk stout. I think it's just that from the nose, I expected it to be not as sweet as it is. The mouth mirrors the nose, but perhaps the peanut butter flavor on the palate is much more subtle than in the aroma. Also, a lot of the sweetness is perceived to have an artificial sweetener vibe that is less than ideal for me. The finish is long and has a nice roasty, charcoally chocolate/coffee flavor.

Feel: Mouthfeel is relatively thick. This is smooth and chewy. Carbonation is spot on. Really nice.

Overall: This is my first Tree House beer that was not a New England IPA. This beer reminds me a lot of another peanut butter milk stout that I enjoyed: Gunner's Daughter from Mast Landing. One of the differences is that Gunner's Daughter does not have coffee and that Hold On To Sunshine is higher ABV. Overall, this is a really great coffee milk stout. It was hard to choose between a 4.25 and 4.5 overall; in the end, I gave it a 4.25 because the artificial sweetener taste knocks it down slightly for me.",4.34
Hold On To Sunshine,"16 ounce can in a tulip stout glass. Exactly 30 days since canned.

Opaque black crude oil color with a near 3f dark tan cap. A ring remains and leaves splashes of lacing. A beauty.

Smoky roasted malt aroma with peanut butter, chocolate, and fresh roasted coffee.

It tastes like a peanut butter, chocolate, and roasted coffee mix over a campfire. Nice.

Palate friendly full body and flavors. No sign of its 7.6% abv. Very rich and roasted.

Before opening, I let this sit for an hour after removing from the fridge. The temperature enhanced its aroma and feel. Rich and creamy peanuts and chocolate. Not built for every day drinking but so good.",4.52
Hold On To Sunshine,"A very rich beer. Pours black as motor oil, about the same consistency as well. A finger of dark brown head reducing to a ring of bubbles, leaving no lacing. Nose is peanut butter, chocolate, roasted coffee and molasses. Taste follows suit with peanut butter upfront and the rest taking a back seat. Very decadent beer but not overwhelming. Feel is full, creamy, and thick. I liked it and would drink more.",3.92

Hold On To Sunshine,"Pours very dark, pretty viscous, decent mocha head that slowly fades. Huge peanut butter aroma mixes with minimal chocolate.

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Poured from a 750mL bottle into my Troubadour tulip:

Lightly hazy icterine liquid supports a half finger of magnolia soft peaks. Crenelated, nearly rocky lacing; superior retention.

Lemon curd, wildflowers, hay, and short bread in the nose - mild wild notes and hints of white grapes as well.

Brett. forward on the palate, tart, funky, and gently peppery. Unripe pears, meyer lemon, and some minerality. Low bitterness, moderate sourness. More fruit than phenols. Finishes fairly dry with some residual ""wild"" elements. Flavor improves a bit as it warms with some faint peach emerging.

Medium bodied, soft, well carbonated. Refreshing yet satisfying.

Well crafted; controlled rather than rustic. Better with food, as the ale's flavors seem more refined and diverse in contrast to whatever bread/cheese you might pair them with.",4.32

Tally ho! I feel like Errol Flynn in “The Seahawk” while drinking this thing. Just wow. It’s as if nothing can stop me and that I could have it all. Maybe my mind is even a bit blurred and stirred by its beauty. So much so that I think that I don’t need Olivia de Haviland because I want them all.

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"No bottling date (number on inside of cap indicates potential batch 10 or later, released in 4/2020); consumed on 12/31/21

Pours a barely translucent dark honey-gold body capped with two fingers of rocky, fluffy, off-white foam; solid head retention leaves a craggy sliver of cap, a moderate, frothy collar, and a haphazard spatter of spotty/webby lacing dotted across the walls of the glass.

Aromas open to green apple with waxy hints of medicinal mango as touches of straw accent saison yeast toward composted guava over the middle; moist oak meets waxy funk with hints of lemon peel into the back end for a culmination of active, oily bacteria bursting with funky fruit.

Taste shows evenly dispersed lactic funk in the backdrop against a predominant waxy tropical fruit overlay lingering across the palate, with zesty lemon and oak barrel to an interlude of musty white wine tannins and a grassy back end; shades of barnyard with waxy white grape funk persist as lemon zest remains through the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body with ample, fluffy carbonation on the higher end of moderate; a slick, oily funk peaks to a glistening lactic tartness over the mid-palate, mild yet indomitable as a clean brightness with a hint of prickly grit disperses through the back end, leaving a predominantly clean, activated finish.

A bright, funky peak reached casually and with an almost unflinching consistency, the oak is a subtle background contributor interwoven with the bacterial evolution of a ripe tannic structure; bold and unwaveringly dynamic.",4.36
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Appearance - The beer poured an orange-gold color with a bubbly white head.

Smell - The nose had pleasant citrus notes with the saison funk also apparent.

Taste - My initial impression was the taste of green apples. The sour impression fit the green apple notes. The saison aspects produced a vinegary funk. Any sweetness from the beginning was cancelled by the dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation gave influence to the dry finish.

Overall - This is pretty much everything I want in a saison. I don’t need heartburn medicine to drink this beauty.",4.46
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"A 750ml bottle, with no bottled on or best before date (although I’m pretty sure it’s either B1 or B2). Poured into a Tilquin stemmed glass.

Appearance: A hazy golden colour with a one finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly to a ring around the glass, while leaving some lacing.

Aroma: Funky, barnyard, minerals, light tartness, tropical stone fruit, apricot, unripe berries, green apple, citrus, grapefruit, lemon peel, oak, a touch of grains, with slight pepper notes.

Taste: Tart, tropical and citrus fruity, grapefruit, apricot, green apple, light funk, oak, vinous, with a lightly spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: Unfortunately, I haven’t had the opportunity to try it fresh, but this bottle having aged 6 / 7 years, has aged gracefully with wonderful complex yet balanced aroma and flavours.",4.49
Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"A bit of a gusher. Pours clear, dark gold with strong effervescence and three fingers of rocky, meringue-like, yellowed head. Decent retention gives way to thick, webbed lacing.

A little lemon and mixed fruit, clear wood, a hint of must and some pepper in the very enticing aroma.

Sour lemon again up front in the taste. Certainly tart, but without being an enamel stripper. Balanced somewhat by the strong wood, a little funk and again just a hint of mixed fruit sweetness. Maybe a little mineral water or clay in the finish.

Very soft feel. A touch more heft than expected. Soft, tickley carbonation.

A beautifully crafted beer from start to finish. A little more robust than some super refined beers, while still managing to expertly balance the sourness, tartness, funk and wood. A real treat.",4.37

Cellarman Barrel Aged Saison,"Bottle from The Beermongers. Thanks, Sam!

A clear golden yellow with a dense white head with good retention and lacing. The nose is pretty excellent, a soft, bright tartness,with notes of key lime, lemon, a light, lightly toasted French oak note, mildly vinous and fruity. There's a little grape, and a real nice Brett expression, lightly spicy with a little clove and pepper and a touch of pineapple juice to go with a mild floral honey note. Really nice depth and structure.

The palate opens tart with a nice blend of lactic and lemon acidity along with a really nice Brett funk. The lactic acidity is sharp but fleeting, priming the palate for the fruit that follows. Delicate pineapple, grape, peach and honey are present. Minimal straw notes. The Brett expression is restrained but thoughtfully executed, pairing nicely with the oak notes, tannins, light vanillin and almost vinous notes. Drying, mildly tannic and earthy on the finish, long lasting with firm acidity. Light in body, crisply carbonated, nicely structured. Impressive.",4.49

PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,"Appearance: Arrives fudge colored with a beige head that settles in as a film but leaves plenty of lacing

Smell: The Tequila barrel aromatics dominate but there are lots of complementary aromatics of chocolate, spice cake, Bourbon and Brandy

Taste: Dark chocolate foward with hints of spice cake, brown sugar and vanilla; through the middle, the barrel tones emerge, with Tequila leading but the Bourbon and Brandy also in the mix; the finish brings all the flavors together with a slightly boozy edge

Best smoked beer I’ve ever had. Balanced but still gives you a nice kachow in the kisser with that smoke bomb. Drinkable af but notable and memorable.

Im not a huge smoke beer person and about 1/2 way through a pour I’m usually pawning it off on the nearest buddy…but I’ve ordered this a few times now and drank every bit.

Thin, light brown head. Darkest of chestnut color, with no sign of light through glass. A bit sweet, bourbonized toffee aroma, with a touch of spiced woodiness.

The taste is liquid gold. Lots of black licorice right away. Some charred wood on the back end. Some nice dark chocolate in the middle. Dark fruit coming through as well. Cherries and blackberries. Brown sugar and vanilla starts to come out as well. Some dark German bread. Really nice flavor.

Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) with a medium sized dark beige head which stuck around for a while.

Smell: Moderate Bourbon, brown sugar, mild vanilla and perhaps the faintest hint of tequila. A nice smelling IS.

Taste: Fairly prominent Bourbon, mild tequila notes, brown sugar, chocolate, and roast malt notes. The beer is mildly sweet, but the tequila notes and tannic oak notes help the beer finish fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Subdued alcohol presence for the ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the light side of medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

Overall: A good bal-aged beer from Firestone Walker. The tequila and bourbon bal-aging work well together in the flavor profile. This one is a keeper for sure.",4.48
PNC Imperial Buckwheat Stout,"There's been a weird undercurrent the last few years that 'there aren't good tequila aged beers'. This, central waters and fiftyfifty often come to mind when I hear that aforementioned incorrect opinion. Had this at the very first Firestone Walker Invitational. Quite the nice find. Did they also bring it to the Bistro's barrel aged festival a few years ago? I dunno, you always remember the first and then after that its like ""meh"".

Anyways, pours black, had a very thin head on tap. Aroma gave off a nice mild tequila and wood presence, I thought it was cool. The taste took on a smooth, sweet tequila and low roast low bitterness kind of stout beers. A mix of different mild sweeteners, brown sugar, agave, vanilla = smoov just doin' his thang. Its a rather creamy beer that doesn't get bogged down in being oversweetened, fully hits the sweet spot but doesn't go beyond.

Its pretty good stuff and I could easily see dropping a nice penny to have this again. Its unique and very good.",4.14
Darkness,"Darkness (2020) from Surly Brewing, Gorgon label with black wax. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 18.00 (Including tax)/22 oz bottle ($ 0.819/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 09/07/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped on shoulder of bottle in nearly invisible ink “BOTTLED ON 09/08/20”. Served at 58.6 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 65.6 degrees.
Appearance – 3.75.
First pour – Amber Brown (SRM 18), muddy.
Body – Brown (SRM 30), opaque. When rear-lite, limited penetration but deep amber at the edges.
Head – Large (Maximum six cm, aggressive center pour), initially brown sugar but lightening to fawn as it breathes, high-density, good retention, diminishing to a 0.3 to 0.5 cm crown and complete, rocky cap. As the head retracts, multiple partial and complete rings of tiny to small bubbles remain.
Lacing – Good. As the level drops, a wide band of tiny to small bubbles grows, separated from the above band by tiny stalactites and stalagmites. See also above.
Aroma – 4 – Moderate fruity malt and chocolate. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.75 – Begins markedly bitter with malt, although this bitterness ameliorates as it breathes. Seems pretty straightforward in taste – malt, a little chocolate, no dark fruit, no char, no coffee. No ethanol (12 % ABV, according to BA, NOT marked on label) aroma or taste. Good gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl. Ends with hops predominating.
Palate – 4.25 – Full, creamy, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.25 Looks like pretty much every Impy stout and RIS on the market. Both the aroma and flavor are uncomplex and good – malt and chocolate – with only a small taste of organic acids edging in at the aftertaste but not pushing out the hops. The hoppy ending is unexpected and excellent!",4.36
Darkness,"2020 release. Poured from undated bottle into a pint glass. It pours a dark mahogany with a full finger of luxurious, creamy, light mocha head and very thick lacing. It's a great looking pour. On the nose there is rich chocolate, freshly-brewed coffee, caramel/toffee, roasted nuts, leather, tobacco smoke, and char. The taste opens with lots of chocolate, toffee, raisins, and black cherry, along with strong coffee, dark chocolate, and dry barley. The fruit influence is stronger than I anticipated but welcome. It's also more bitter and hoppy than expected. The Amarillo and Simcoe adds a different dimension. The balance of sweet and bitter is terrific. Its mouth feel is creamy but not as thick and chewy as other big Russian Imperial Stouts. The carbonation is appropriate and the 12% ABV is warming. Overall, Darkness is an extremely well crafted RIS and deserves its World-Class rating.",4.42

Flavor: The flavor is dark roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee, very noticeable cherry, perhaps some dark fruits, raisins, plums, ending in a grassy and grapefruit rind like bitterness. Very flavorful. Slightly bitter, no alcohol flavor, very complex.

Body/Overall: Full body, very delicious.",4.53

Opaque in the glass, nice 2 fingers of head.

Aroma of dark chocolate, dark roasted malt, sambuca, molasses, sweet dark fruits.

Velvety smooth in the mouth, has a good amount of weight to it as well.

Tastes just as it smells, this is Russian Imperial Stout decadence here. Dark chocolate present throughout the palate, the molasses and sambuca are more mid palate, and the sweet finish of dark cherries and currants are a lingering treat in the finish along with that dark roasted malt.

Aging for over 5 years likely softened any alcohol heat and made for a delicious and decadent stout that does not disappoint, even with sky high expectations going in. I also have a 2020 bottle I will be comparing it to soon.",4.92
Darkness,"2021 Vintage

APPEARANCE
Pitch black body and a hefty three fingers of fluffy, tan-colored head

AROMA
An onslaught of leather, coffee, black licorice, tobacco, char, cherries. I mean, it goes down the list of everything you want in a superior RIS.

TASTE
Dark chocolate bomb with all of the aforementioned RIS accoutrement (fancy word) from the aroma. Most prominent is the black coffee and cherries. A finish of tobacco and smoke is blowing wind up my dress and a lingering hop bitterness has my leg shaking reminiscent of a dog getting a belly rub.

MOUTHFEEL
Smooth and velvety. There is no alcohol taste on this big bastard, but a noticeable warmth is prevalent on each sip.

OVERALL
World Class RIS. I am no stranger to Surly Darkness and will never pass up a chance to have this.",4.54
Darkness,"2021 edition. In the glass it looks almost black, but on the pour it looks a deep ruby red dark brown as light passes through. Quite pretty to watch. There is an inch plus of dense, brown foam falls to a substantial layer of bubbly goodness that laces incredibly.

The smell is rich, dark malt and more rich, dark malt. As it comes to life with warming, noticeable alcohol, coffee, baking chocolate, a dried fruit like dates and figs with some cherry. I think a slight caramel or brown sugar note creeps in.

The taste...holy mother of dark malty goodness! The promise of the aroma is delivered by the boatload. Waves of malt, the chocolate melds with the caramel/sugary and fruit notes, a mild coffee flashes by, and it becomes almost like fudge. The malt rules but doesn't overpower. Just when you think it's done, a strong bitter hit wakes you up along with a smack of booze for good measure. A very mild charred taste creeps in, but it is not overly strong.

The mouthfeel is smooth and rich, but not overly thick - luxurious and indulgent. Carbonation is tame as it should be. The quick but strong bitter hit and alcohol tingle remind you this isn't a lightweight.

Overall...I might have to go on the hunt to find more of this. I suspect it will age incredibly well. Outstanding in every way, this beer has everything and RIS should have and nothing it shouldn't - as worthy a brew as you can find.",4.59
Darkness,"2016 - Cerberus. Black wax.

Poured aggressively into a Snörkel tulip glass.
Thick head of tiny dark tan bubbles that dissipated to a thin cap. No lacing left in the glass.

Aroma of dark roasted malts, burnt coffee beans, raisins and char.

Taste is an abundance of dark roasted malts, coffee, bitter cacao and black cherries. Help up surprisingly well after 5 years!

Mouthfeel is heavy and full of tongue coating malts. Carbonation seems to be light, but could be due to age, not a negative. Not Eben a hint of double digit abv.

Overall, there's a reason why this is so highly rated. It's a winner through and through, even after sitting for 5 years waiting. Strong RIS, not to be taken lightly.",4.23
Darkness,"Really quite incredible head production, retention, and lacing given the ABV. Head is dark beige, not quite dark brown; body is an ebon hue befitting the name.

Impressively roasty aroma, along with a healthy dose of hops. Red grape, toast, moderate char, prune, dark bread, cola. It's dark, over the top, impressive, and incredibly inviting.

Thick and creamy mouthfeel, bordering on chewy. Fantastic. It feels every bit of the 12% ABV, but without harshness. It's bold enough to scare away the weak-willed, but smooth enough to reward the bold.

It's a bit of a throwback RIS on the palate: hoppy, charred, roasty, and very, very strong. Tons of dark fruit and dark bread, along with red grapes, caramel, toffee, chocolate, espresso, leather.

This is nothing less than a fantastic RIS, fully worthy of its lofty standing and rating.",4.54
Darkness,"Pours darkness of course, dark tan head good lacing.

Aroma is huge roasted malt notes, rich chocolate and coffee smooth and sweet with dark fruit notes, vanilla almost like cherry vanilla coke notes. All this is blended together in harmony.

Taste is like the nose rich and smooth big roasted notes. Loads of chocolate smooth and sweet but also some roasted coffee bitterness mingled with dark fruits. Hops keep it from cloying but don't really pick up bitterness except for the roasted bitterness. Finish is smooth and delicious lingering chocolate and roasted malts with the cherry vanilla coke notes.

Mouthfeel is big and smooth a creamy treat. Smooth mellow carbonation.

Overall amazing what can be done with just roasted malts none of the additives used in all the big dessert stouts now a days. One fabulous brew. Bought another bottle to bring home to share it was so good.",4.65

Poured out dark brown and settles like a dark night. A 1 and half inch head forms and settles into 1/4 inch light brown that does not go away.

Smell is a barrage of dark malt , dark chocolate, dark fruits and coffee. Exactly what is expected.

Taste is whats expected. Follows the nose like Tucan. Perfect blend of chocolate,coffee, caramel , fudge...pure glory in this one.

The mouthfeel is excellent. On the thick side and coats everything leaving flavor to resonate on the palate.",4.84
Darkness,"2020 bottle.Pours into a goblet jet black with a billowing deep mocha colored head that leaves a nice full ring of froth behind as it settles very slowly.Fig and caramel aromas up front then the deep chocolate and toffee really come thru,amazing on the nose.Flavors of cherry and fig hit the palate than the deep chocolate/fudge hits with a hefty roast but not big enough to over take the dark fruits and chocolate,booze in the back end.Wow great stuff,been holding it,it lived up to the billing for me.",4.54
Darkness,"Pours jet black in color with minimal head. Taste is baker's and milk chocolate, slight barrel and char with a touch of vanilla. Heavy body, roasty, slightly sweet, low carbonation. Based off of some of the variations, I was not expecting to like this as much as I do. No frills stout that tastes like beer, not dessert, not barrel...even though they are there, but beer. Very very impressive. One of the best stouts I have had in some time.",4.32
Arcane Rituals,"Many thanks to PhineasMcClintock for sharing this bottle!

A - Dark brown pour, thin dense cream colored lacing, no carbonation.

S - Sweet dark fruit along with sweet malt.

T - Brown sugar, dark fruit, Bourbon, and some brandy.

M - Big, syrupy, viscous, lip smacking sticky, and some warming on the way down.

O - This one is impressive with layer after layer of complexity. Highly recommended!",4.45
Arcane Rituals,"Pours a deep amber brown color with thin tan head. Smells of sweet dark fruit and caramel. The taste is of caramel brown sugar and toffee, bitter boozy finish. The feel is full bodied and smooth, subtle burn. Overall a fantastic barleywine.",4.25
Arcane Rituals,"Pours a very dark brown with no head formation after a modest pour straight into the glass. Some oily legs form on the glass after a light swirl. Aroma is dark fruits, fig, toffee, and brown sugar with a hearty throughout. Caramel, toasty, and light bready malts shape the rest of the beer aroma profile. Sweet cognac and light bourbon heat pair up with barrel character for a subtle twist of heat within an otherwise sugar nose. Flavor profile is cognac booze right up front, paired together with dark fruits and figs. After the opening act, bourbon, brown sugar, almond, and grassy, herbal hops take over, forming a slightly sticky, firmly sweet flavor profile. Barrel character is minor, instead allowing individual liquors to shine and simmer in the spotlight. Wonderful dynamics and shape from start to finish. Mouth feel is a boiled-over-medium texture with a near still effervescence that carries a consistent minor fluffiness throughout. Just a little bit plush, but mostly flat. Thickness is medium-thick. Overall, really incredible use of various liquor influences to enhance and build on a dark fruit, fig, and toffee forward ale. Despite only being 11.37% ABV for this batch's bottling, it's a powerhouse of flavor.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 500mL bottle. 2021 release. ""Batch 002"". ABV: 11.37%.",4.51
Arcane Rituals,"2021 vintage, 11.37 ABV

Just what I hoped it'd be. The barrels are prominent, I get some bourbon and plenty of brandy/cognac, can't quite tease these two apart but I taste plenty of boozy fruit. They also bring hints of vanilla and leather. An incredibly decadent base beer shines through as well. Quite sweet, with notes of toffee, brown sugar, cherry, figs, and so much more. I love the lingering boozy exhale. The body is full and sticky with light carbonation. Lives up to the hype.",4.68
Arcane Rituals,12/28/2021: Poured from a 500ml bottle into a stemless wine glass. Thanks to Josh for the share. I sampled this right after VSOJ so that is a tough follow but this beer is excellent in mouthfeel and flavor.,4.5
Arcane Rituals,"Pours a dark ruby tinged brown color. Opaque and shiny. Thin, velvety tan head forms on the beer before dissipating. The only residual head is a thin ring of foam along the outside of the top of the beer. Aroma is incredibly rich and pungent for a barleywine. There are notes of rich bread, fruit cake, dark fruit and overly ripe cherries, toffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, along with strong barrel notes that carry notes of each - cognac, brandy, and bourbon.

Taste follows the nose with notes of boozy fruit cake, dark cherries, oak, light tannic notes, toffee, brown sugar, with light notes of vanilla and cocoa with a slight cherry tartness on the back end. Lots of barrel character comes through with clear notes of brandy, bourbon, and cognac showing up in the profile. Its sweet - not too sweet, but definitely on the sweeter side of barleywines. The profile overall is decadent, rich and flavorful. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and viscous. Carbonation is sprightly but nicely balanced. Trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is an amazing barleywine - I know I have used the word decadent multiple times in the review, but it really is the best way to describe this beer.",4.72
Arcane Rituals,"Appearance: Very dark brown color with a medium sized beige head that slowly faded but stuck around nicely. A good looking Barleywine.

Smell: Bourbon & fruity brandy aromas jump out the glass. I also pickup moderate brown sugar aromas. The nose is inviting.

Taste: Toffee/brown sugar, Bourbon notes, and Brandy notes all make their presence felt in the flavor profile. The beer starts off fairly sweet and though it dries up a bit in the finish, it still has a fair bit of sweetness. Maybe because I know what was used but I swear I can pick up peach notes from the Peach brandy barrels it was aged in. Mild alcohol presence for the listed 11.37% ABV.

Mouth-feel: on the full side of medium-bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Full mouthfeel for a BW.

Overall: A very good Barleywine for my tastes. Somewhat on the sweet side but it has a nice, complex, and tasty flavor profile.",4.5
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,Pours a dark brownish black. Aroma is milky dark chocolate with coffee. Taste follows nose with roastiness. Mouthfeel is creamy & full. Very nice stout.,4.53
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"16oz can.

Pours opaque black with a half inch head of brown. Malted milk balls with dark chocolate and cocoa-dusted espresso beans in the nose. Full bodied with a crushed velvet mouthfeel. Brownie batter with chips of fudge on the palate. Finishes sweet and rich with chocolate cake and faint espresso.",4.43
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Pours black, significant brown head. It definitely has that milk stout aroma - tangy/lactose and some alcohol. Taste is roasty with dark chocolate. Some umami/meatiness/soy sauce as well. Feel is somewhat creamy. Overall, one of my favorite milk stouts.",4.33
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"Pours like syrup--smooth and sweet. Very dark brown with a mocha head. It is rich with strong milk chocolate flavor, and subtle coffee flavor underneath. Several good aspects to this stout, but perhaps a bit too sweet, making this lean toward dessert beer.",4.04
All That Is And All That Ever Will Be,"16oz can poured into a snifter.

A: Black on the pour with two fingers of brown head. Retention is good, lacing manifests in broken rings.

S: Nose is heavy on the chocolate. Brownie batter and a generous helping of Hershey’s chocolate syrup. Fatty nibs. Bit of woody roast and earthy hop. Berry-like fruity note. Nutty coffee.

T: Follows the nose. Chocolate all over the attack. Cocoa nibs, brownie batter, chocolate syrup in a big way. Sugary lactose. That berry fruitiness comes through tasting like a raspberry tootsie pop. Pervasive background flavor of nutty coffee. Quick flash of earthy hops, and woody and roasty malt flavors poke through now and again. Perhaps some subtle cola. Roasty and Chocolatey finish.

M: Rich and thick in the mouth. Coating and almost syrupy. Tons of residual sugar. Carbonation is ample but gentle, and fluffs things up a little.

O: Might be an unpopular opinion, but this is just too sweet for me. Tree House has a penchant for taking all of their dark beers well onto the sweet side of things, and some fare better there than others. Here there is just not quite enough hop, coffee, or black malt bitterness to bring it into any semblance of balance. It does finish drier than it starts, but it isn’t nearly enough to save the drinkability. You gotta have a serious sweet tooth to enjoy beers like this, and unfortunately I find that I tend to favor balance and dryness as opposed to a candy-bomb like this. It tastes like chocolate syrup and sits like 16oz of chocolate syrup in the stomach. Looks like sweet sells though, so maybe I’m just an old grouch now.",3.4
Crusher,"Poured from a can with no visible date into a teku. Can purchased on 8/15/22 from The Alchemist.

L- Beautiful opaque deep golden color.

S- Some “Dank” along with a hint of pine.

T- Up front piney bite, but not
overpowering.

F- Moderate carbonation , dry finish.

O- A fantastic DIPA! Not too sweet and
juicy, not too resiny. Just perfect!",4.23
Crusher,5/12/22 Canned 2/23/22. This is one powerful brew. Flavorful. Hops forward. Perfect piney bitterness. Dry finish. Citrus. Thirst quenching. Could be a favorite. It is!,4.6
Crusher,"Appearance - The beer poured a hazy golden color with a white head.

Smell - Hops were noted, with the presence of citrus and bitterness.

Taste - The overall profile was dank. It was oily with a nice level of bitterness. The profile of citrus fruits were noted. Even though it was on the heavier side, it could make for a nice easy drinking.

Mouthfeel - Carbonation was appropriate, even with a thicker viscosity.

Overall - even though some might see this as a lighter beer, the taste comes with a heavier pprofile.",4.5
Crusher,"Picked-up a four-pack of cans at the Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, Vermont for twelve dollars and seventy cents. My seventh brew from these guys. Good beer, prefer HT & FB.",4.25
Crusher,"Slight haze with a golden orange hue with a typical Alchemist unfiltered with detritus swimming about. The nose is large and overpowering in a good way - prepping your tastebuds. Spicy, piney, earthen, skunky weed and tropical fruit notes.
The patience is rewarded with complex resin hop notes - fresh hoppiness, dried hoppiness fully crushing on the palate. All those nose notes are there but dare I say the aroma outweighs the taste. Finishes will a touch of malt and some bitterness.",4.34
Crusher,"L: Hazy light Amber with a big bubbled head and very little lacing.

S: Pine, grapefruit, mango, and citrus pith hop aroma. Big peach esters. Also a fairly substantial candied malt character for the style.

T: Big pine resin, grapefruit, and mango/pineapple flavors. Substantial bready caramel malt balance. The bitterness is firm but never dominates.

F: Medium/light bodied, very dry, crisp finish.

Overall: I was really impressed with this one. I honestly prefer it to Heady, which is saying a lot. I cannot recommend this on enough.",4.25
Sosus,"22oz bottle - review from notes

I've been meaning to get my hands on this one. A double IPA from one of my favorite Ipa-making breweries. And this doesn't disappoint, with massive pine and floral notes. Smells (and tastes?) like a bottle of pine-sol

great stuff",3.66
Sosus,"A: Medium haziness of orange for coloring with a white soapy foam composition of one inch. Sticky strands of lacing. Strong carbonation factor.

S: Really sweet sugary peaches, watermelon and guava. A bit of strawberry-lemonade. Good strength. Has a bit of juicy Gatorade flair.

T: Dry flowery hopping, citrus, and orange grind with a bready malting.

M: Bready malty consistency for mouthful.

O: Overall loved the nose, fruity and berry like, fresh, wet and Gatorade like. The flavor was a bit less impressing, less complexed and basic.",3.9
Sosus,"Review 1491

I enjoy Toppling Goliath Beers, I have yet to try their darker beers. The best by date is in a week, I need to get this one gone. The beer is 44 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour created a bright white foamy and airy two-fingered head. The dissipation of the head left abundant lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is SRM 5, pale straw, with golden hues. The beer is mostly clear with some haziness lurking within. The appearance of the beer is elegant.

The initial aromas in the beer are pine needles, grapefruit rind, floral esters, and herbal. Nosing further in the glass, I detect toasted bread crust, lightly toasted malts, oranges, lemons, papaya, and a touch of solvent.

The flavors in the beer are grapefruit, oranges, melons, lemons, guava, pineapple, herbal, floral esters, bready, lightly toasted malts, pine needles, phenols, wet grass, and peaches.

The mouthfeel of the beer is carbonated, astringent, and crisp.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-plus carbonations, and a fuller finish.

The one thing that is off-putting in this beer is the carbonation, it is strong, bubbly. The flavors of the hops are wonderful but bitter with a steady malt backbone. A pleasant DIPA, not sure it is worth the high score that it has. I have better DIPAs with the harmony finessed.",4.14
Sosus,Nice dark yellow color. Strong citrus notes and very hoppy. A lot of sediment at the bottom. Definitely a bit weird to have that much but overall a very tasty Double IPA.,4.65
Sosus,"Maybe it was an off can or I was just not in the right mood, but my first exposure to this last week (from Tavour) was very meh, especially compared to the other TG offerings I've had. Fortunately I have a couple more cans and will try again soon.

Bitterness was really the only thing that stood out to me.",4.0
Sosus,"L: A pale murky yellow, with a slight greenish and warm orange tints. Two fingers of stark white sticky foam with great retention and some splotches and wide bands of lace on the glass. The lacing is really beautiful.

S: Earthy papaya, and greener aromas such as green papaya and underripe pineapple. Both piney and peppery.

T: Still insanely bitter on the palate, but the other flavors are quite soft in contrast. And wow that bitter dryness goes on and on. I do like it though. Most would not pound this back - it's a sipper.

F: Smooth and mostly dry. Medium weight and decent carbonation.

O: I rarely call anything too bitter. This one is pushing limits. Overall I don't think it's my favorite from TG, (that might be Scorpius Morchella) but it is a really nice drink, that I hope to repeat.",4.39
Sosus,Pours cloudy amber with a bunch of floaties drifting around inside. Aroma is hoppy citrus. Taste is hop bitter with some citrus notes. Feel is a bit astringent but not unpleasant. Overall it’s an interesting hoppy DIPA.,4.01
Sosus,"Pours a semi translucent golden color with a nice egg shell colored head, which if left undisturbed turns into little cream like dollops,A noticeable amount of sediment is present. This is a very fresh beer. Smells like mild fruit loops,fresh grass ,some conifer.Taste pineapple bread like profile, the mosaic hop is definitely well showcased in a subtle malt bill, almost wanting a bit more malt. Feels medium body, finishes juicy.Overall a very good DIPA showcase beer. REVISION: 3/22/21, this beer is tasty but the amount of sediment on the bottom of a Teku glass looks about 2 Teaspoons. It sort of turns me off. Is it yeast? some hop pieces? not really sure.",4.02
Sosus,"Canned 12/24/20. Pours a moderately hazy light gold, robust 2"" egg shell head with excellent thick lacing. Nose is dank, juicy, and hempy, even nearly two months. out. Tropical fruit, mango juice. Thyme, pine, poultry spices. Only the smallest hint of rawness from the hops deep in the nose. The taste is more subdued than the powerful nose; slight oily, spicy, resinous, and bitter notes throughout, even numbing like a sichuan peppercorn. Moderate juicy sweetness, but the hop spiciness is strong enough to prevent it from taking a leading role. Mouthfeel is typical - round and soft, light carbonation. I was more impressed with the aroma than the taste, but its spiciness was enjoyable.",4.22
Sosus,"The brew pours a cloudy orange with a 2 cm foam cap. The foam is fine.
The aroma is pungent. Tropical fruit is featured.
The flavor is full with mango, orange and guava. The hop bitterness is moderate, but not harsh.
The mouthfeel is very soft and smooth.
This is a very enjoyable quaff.",4.39
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"22 oz bomber (2015)

A- Pours pitch black with a thin mocha colored head. Minimal lacing throughout.

S- Dark chocolate comes through immediately with undertones of vanilla. There is a light undercurrent of cinnamon wafting in the background. I take an extra strength whiff (for science) and only then can I start picking up some stale, oxidation characteristics. It is nearly imperceptible and has no real impact.

T- Following closely from the nose, the flavor starts off with smooth dark chocolate dominating at first, with the vanilla providing ample support. As the beer warms to room temperature, the cinnamon starts its move from the periphery to becoming a more integral component. Cinnamon is something which can easily be off putting to me in larger doses but here it is well integrated and nicely complements the stronger chocolate and vanilla flavors. No perceptible heat or spiciness to me from the chile peppers. It's quite possible this aspect has faded over time. I do think there are some remnants adding to the total flavor profile but I'm just not able to easily pick them out. The only slight knock I can give is that the barrel characteristics are minimal.

M - Slightly oily with a medium body. Carbonation (medium) has held up quite well.

O - For whatever reason, I had low expectations going in for this beer after being cellared for six years. However, it has held up remarkably well in that time. I regrettably did not have this beer when it was released so cannot give any comparison. On its own, it's a delicious beer.",4.41
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"I received a can from @FBarber in a BIF. Canned on 1/29/2020. Poured into a snulip glass. I took it out of the fridge about 2 hours before pouring, then put it back in about 15 minutes before pouring. It pours a very dark walnut - approaching black. The medium mocha head dissipated very quickly, a sign of the alcohol content. Lots of raisin on the nose, along with roasted malt, chocolate, a whiff of freshly-brewed coffee, and earthy charred nuts. You can also readily smell the bourbon barrel. This is right in my wheelhouse taste-wise. It opens with bakers chocolate and coffee but the raisin has carried over, as well. There are also notes of caramel and earthy char, and the caliente pepper adds heat. The bourbon barrel is strong but not distractingly so. As the glass warms, I think the chocolate is stronger and a bit sweeter and the pepper hotter. The feel is viscous and creamy with lite carbonation and there's no avoiding the 14% ABV. The 12 oz. format is appropriate. Overall, this is a superb example of RIS - my favorite style, and it richly deserves its World-Class rating. I really like the combination of the chocolate malts and dark fruit.",4.64
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Look - Very little head with almost zero retention, and no signs of much carbonation. Opaque black in color.
Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, with underlying notes of cinnamon and vanilla and subtle chiles.
Taste - An almost perfect blending of Mexican chocolate and bourbon. The chiles were quite noticeable, but did not overwhelm in terms of flavor or heat. The same can be said of the bourbon.
Feel - Mouthfeel was a touch thin on the palate but enjoyable.
Overall - The aroma and flavors were so big and well balanced that I found myself focusing almost purely on those aspects. I would have enjoyed a bit more body on the palate, but that in no way detracted from my enjoyment. This is among the best beers I've had to employ chile peppers.",4.56
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"12oz can, dated 01.29.2020, 2019 vintage stamped on the side of the can, poured into a 14oz brandy snifter.

The beer pours a deep jet black color, thick and viscous with a thin half finger of khaki head that recedes quickly, yielding no film nor any lacing. The aroma is pleasant, tons of fudge and chocolate, light pepper heat, tons of cinnamon, modest barrel, a nice oakiness with a good char and a bit of vanilla. The flavors are good, tons of chocolate, brownie batter and fudge but also a nice bitterness, dry cinnamon, light pepper heat with a super smooth bourbon character, lightly charred oak, modest roast with nice hearty grains and a touch of vanilla. The mouthfeel is good, thick and heavy, chewy but smooth and it coats very well with a warm but creamy finish.

Verdict: A very nice adjunct forward barrel aged stout from Spiteful. A great chocolate forward experience that is well balanced and accentuated by the cinnamon and pepper interplay while the vanilla tames the barrel, which isn't too hot and offers even more nuanced character.",4.27
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"1/31/2020: (Spiteful Brewing, Chicago) 5 oz. draft pour into snifter on Spiteful Brewing release day, $7.17, 2019 release is a 14.0% ABV. Black pour, tan head recedes quickly leaving no lacing. Cinnamon aroma leads, significant chili pepper backs well. Cinnamon taste leads, light smooth bourbon taste, pepper more subdued than aroma would lead. Thin body, smooth easy drinking. ABV well masked. Overall solid Barrel Aged stout, glad Spiteful released this after a three year hiatus.",3.99
Barrel-Aged Malevolence Chocolate Caliente,"Black with a slow to build fizzy tan blanket that dies off quickly.

Smell is nutty roast and dry wafer with moderately spicy cinnamon and slightly astringent but fruity and popping chili pepper.

Taste has more depth yet is also refreshing, with just the right amount of warming pepper that is both mildly spicy and sweetly fruity. Cinnamon is lightly dusty and complements the roast of the moderately light-bodied stout. There's a touch of nutty cocoa but not a whole heckuva lot. The carbonation is crisp and lifting for a big stout, with tightly compacted bubbles finishing perfectly semi-dry.

This is like an older school, more drinkable stout with a lighter body and flavorings that don't overpower. Additionally--a shocking note for this day and age--it's not cloying. The only thing I'm not really experiencing here is any barrel. Not even a boozy heat.",4.08
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"2016 Vintage(I Think)

A: Poured into a snifter to a black beer which is topped by a small light tan head which fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with minimal lacing
S: Smells of brandy barrels with some chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
T: Taste is chocolate and coffee up front with some brandy barrel influence. Hints of roasted malts and toasted marshmallows. On the swallow there's more brandy barrel, chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts
M: This beer has a body which is lighter than anticipated and slightly silky. Carbonation is quite low, but it is there while the beer has a sightly drying finish due to the ABV
O: Overall this beer is quite good. It has also held up well over time. Complexity also grows as the beer warms. It's definitely worth a try if you like barrel aged beers.",4.75
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Pours black with a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good after an aggressive pour. Aroma is big. Apple brandy, toffee, barrel, char, and caramel dance and play over roasty and toasty malts. Flavor profile is medium-thin. Roasty and toasty malts lead the charge. Toffee, caramel, molasses, and apple brandy tag on for a flavorful brew. Mouth feel is velvety, and soft, but never hits creamy. It has a medium-thick consistency. Overall, solid stout with hints of apple brandy coming through.

Reviewed from notes. Reviewed 1/12/19. 2018 version.",4.26
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"Really enjoying this. Much less sweet than anticipated and has a nice chally bakers chocolage predominace. The apple brandy tastes genuine and natural whereas I feel I lot of prairies beers are try hard and artificial. Namely vanilla noir which is awfully fake.

Its not terribly complex. Taste like a very simple, basic, strong old school RIS with roasty notes layered with oak and yesz apple bransy. Quite thick and very hot.",4.5
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,This rating is based on the original from a few years ago. Pours dark brown/black with exceptional thickness. The Apple Brandy melds perfectly to make this an exceptional barrel aged stout. For a number of years this was my favorite beer.,4.79
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"I have never really been a fan of the apple brandy BA stouts. The apple character has always been an odd mix for me. I got this bottle for retail on the shelf mostly because I love Prairie and I knew people flip for this beer. Upon opening it, the smell is very distinct and I just don't like it! It smells the way it's supposed to smell, it's just that the apple brandy barrel of off putting to me. Now on the tongue, it's a completely different story for me. The apple is there but distinct and really appealing. A tiny bit tart? The stout's sweetness works well with this barrel. It also helps for it to be a bit warmer too. A great beer that changed my mind. I've never had a beer with a smell that I didn't like end up being enjoyable before, so a really fun beer.",4.58
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,I’ve had a majority of the highest rated/reviewed Prairie Stouts. Probably all of them in the top 250. This is easily the best one of the bunch. Everything is superb!,4.65
Apple Brandy Barrel Noir,"A spectacular stout; as the previous reviewers explain the taste follows the nose - apples, malty, boozy.
You MUST let this warm to experience the full flavor profile.",4.45
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Opened with no hiss, completely still, no head. Jet black,
Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, some heat from the alcohol
Palate follows the nose, some hot peppers spice on the back end, lingering oak, bourbon
Relatively smooth but much thinner than expected.
The lack of carbonation isn't doing this any favors, guessing I'm missing out on the intended experience.",3.9
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Good runner up to the Original Prairie Bomb. Pours a very dark, opaque brown-black, with a thin tan head. This stout strikes with coffee first, then chocolate and boozy-vinalla. Less complex Taste than the original prairie bomb, with a thick full-bodied mouth feel. Disguise the booziness more and your Prairie Bombs will go straight to the top of the beer cult classic list",4.77
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"Bottled 2016 (I think? It’s hard to read)
Consumed 4/12/20

I’ve been waiting to have this guy for awhile as Bomb is one of my first strong stouts that I’ve ever loved. Some other Prairie stouts can have too many adjuncts for me to really love, but I’m hoping BA Bomb hits the ride balance. First thing I notice is that it seems thinner than other Prairie stouts I’m used to. There’s very little carbonation too, even for a stout. I wonder if the age has something to do with that. Some lacing does stay though after the pour. On the nose I am not getting a lot of barrel but some spice like a regular bomb. I taste a bit of the pepper but not a lot. I think that’s usually what goes after aging. It’s sweet but not overly so. There’s barrel flavor too. Chocolate and vanilla notes a prominent. The beer is great but I wish I had it fresh. I think the aging has muted some of the best components of the beer. The barrel is perfect though. Great beer and worth seeking out!",4.46
Barrel Aged Bomb!,"12oz bottle poured into a snifter. No date on the bottle, but I know it is at least a few years old at this point.

A: Black pour. A little bit of a beige head struggles to form and ultimately fails. Little to no lacing. Not all that concerning for a barrel aged beer of its strength.

S: The chiles are much more forward on the nose than expected, and that’s the first whiff emanating from the glass. Heavy dose of roasty coffee next, followed by a fat fudgey chocolate smell. Chocolate sauce and German chocolate cake. Roasted malt. Oak and whiskey come out more as it warms.

T: In taste, it’s the massive tide of chocolate that hits first. Tons of hot fudge sauce, chocolate truffles, German chocolate cake, fatty nibs, etc. Lots of vanilla too, mingling for a malted milkshake impression. Nutty and roasty coffee brings in a mocha flavor. Lots of whole chile taste too. The heat is extremely mild, but the flavor is big and rides to the forefront for a bit. Oak and whiskey are actually the quietest component, surprisingly, but that sweet whiskey flavor does round things out nicely. Smokey coffee and a tingle of chile heat on the finish.

M: Rich in body with a bit of heft. Chewy and mouth-coating. Velvety. Low and gentle carbonation.

O: A bombastic beer overall, and a bit of a roller coaster ride. Rather than melding into a cohesive whole, each ingredient basically takes a turn reaching out and slapping you right in the palate. It’s big, sweet, and straightforward. Even a little busy, if I’m being honest. That’s not to say it isn’t good- on the contrary, I really did enjoy it. If you’re a person who likes a nice “pastry stout,” you’ll likely love it. I think it’s a solid enough beer, but its brutish approach and bold, hedonistic flavors that vie for attention rather than coalescing can’t touch the more carefully composed and elite barrel-aged stouts. Very good, but not great.",4.04
Starry Noche,"To be clear this is absolutely a desert beer. Recommended to be had in s 4-6oz glass. Extremely thick dark color resembling black syrup. No head or carbonation. There’s a large amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut aromas. Looks, smells and tastes of hazelnut syrup. A little bit goes a long way. Arguably limited to no bourbon taste all hazelnut and chocolate syrup. Very unique goes well at the end of a meal with desert.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately.",4.3
Starry Noche,"This one pours an exceptionally thick looking dark black color, with a small head, and a bit of sticky dark lacing.

This smells like incredibly sweet melted milkshakes – it smells good, but it’s just ridiculously over the top.

There’s an absurd amount of creamy, sweet, sugary hazelnut on the nose here – like a high quality hazelnut coffee thing. Like, it’s certainly tasty, objectively, but it’s just so over the top. More than 1 oz of this is more than enough. There’s basically no barrel, it’s just hazelnut, vanilla, and chocolate syrup overload.

This is one of the thicker stouts that I’ve ever had, just almost a solid instead of a liquid here. There’s no booziness, though.

I really like big pastry stouts, but this one is just too much. I used to really like the Medianoche series, but they seem to just be dialing it up way too far lately.",3.63

My wife got me this one as a X-mas gift some time back, and I’ve been saving it for an occation… with yesterday being that day. The bold 600 ml bottle of B1 is looking really bubbly/curly when pouring in glass- but also: The nose is completely out-of-this-world, bursting with chocolate, hazelnuts and the thickest body imaginable. Mouthfeel is simply outstandingly incredible! This is quite possibly the best beer I’ve had- at least among the top 3. Long lasting, delicious taste that lingers. So happy I got to experience this one!",4.97

Hazelnut paste quickly morphs into cashew cheese and buttered popcorn pot de creme that even verges into popcorn Jelly Belly, as one friend put it. But then my old lady described its nose as dirty dish rag and now I can't smell anything but.

We all had different glasses from different houses and this was our first pour during this bottle share, yet we all had the same offensive experience.

The mouthfeel is otherwise that thick and luscious, almost carbless globularity often hyptastically sought after these days, but not typically my own cup of tea. It clung ever so desperately to the kitchen sink as we drained pour the remaining putrescence.

How b2 has an over 4.5 rating on UnTappd is beyond me. What a bunch of sick, palate-wrecked liars. Speaking of, Anchorage's Sent By Liars is a far superior pastry stout if you're looking for something slightly more accessible that features these adjuncts.",2.52
Starry Noche,"Poured at fridge temp. Pours THICK like motor oil. Wow. Black with almost black head. The nose is incredible. Mostly hazelnuts upfront. Liquid hazelnut cream. Nutella all the way. It's almost hard to pick up much else. Over some time just sitting with the nose, I start to get some dark toffee, coconut, and more milk chocolate. Not a lot of barrel there.

The taste is insane. More dimensions than the nose. Definitely still getting the hazelnut as the dominant flavor, but also picking up some bourbon, toffee, chocolate, molasses, sweet dark fruit. I might say it's a bit too sweet, which is where I dock it a few points. Otherwise, the taste is really nice.

The mouthfeel is ridiculous. So thick and creamy. I would say this is the thickest and creamiest stout I have ever tasted. Definitely a treat.",4.46
Starry Noche,"2021 bottle.

Hazelnut bomb, but in all the best ways. It’s a bit oily and finishes bitter, but when paired with the coconut and thick stout base, it all combines for an amazing experience. And for the price point? 100% worth it every time.",4.54
Starry Noche,"500 mL bottle. Inky black. Smells of coconut and hazelnut. A little bourbon behind. Tastes of bourbon, lots of hazelnut, coconut, sweet chocolate, roasted malt. Harsh oaky bitterness in the finish, but it balances the sugar. Absurd pastry deliciousness.",4.15
Starry Noche,"A shameless explosion of blended barrels and adjuncts that stole my heart, incredible. Black oil appearance with a short lived brown cap. Smell bursts forth with hazelnut, coconut, vanilla, dark chocolate, backed with complex barrel flavors. For the taste I must once again admit I am a hazelnut fan, so this was paradise for me, huge rich hazelnut and chocolate dance amongst the oak and bourbon soak coconut, vanilla, faint dark roast coffee, caramel, and nutella. Feel is thick, chewy, warm, has a hint of nuttiness but way more so rich, full and decadent with the weight. I loved starriest night so it makes sense why I adored this, beer of the year entry only 21 days in!",4.74
Insert Hip Hop Reference There,"16 oz. can. Hazy yellow. Smells of booze, lime, herbal notes, and tropical fruit. A little acidic. Tastes acidic up front, but it dies down quickly. Sweet pale malt. Tropical fruit and some citrus. Boozy finish. Heavy IPA. Drinks strangely well for such a huge IPA.",3.83
Insert Hip Hop Reference There,"L - murky pour with thick, impenetrable haze. Looks like mud. Dark orange mango juice. Menacing, almost. Big-bubbled head that dissipates a little less quickly than typical Trillium fare, but I can already tell it's not going to stick around long.

S - hits hard with lime and bread. Toasted orange peel and graham crackers. Pithy pineapple, vegetal qualities, and hop puree. Smells like choking down hops. That's a good thing. If hops were air, I could breathe this.

T - lively burst of grapefruit juice. Some serious depth of flavor, featuring papaya, guava, apricot, and bubblegum if ""hops"" were a flavor. Warming, doughy orange peel and loads of citrus pith. Oat bitterness. Full and suffocating in flav. Rindy OJ, complete with pulp. Pineapple freshness. Syrupy candy on the finish that quicky zips it up with some tingly bitterness and lingering dryness.

F - pillowy. Yes, generic description, but it's true. It's seriously full and satisfying. An elixir to behold.

O - just wow. Such flavor range. Like wringing out every last bitter drop of your favorite ball of citrus. If I lived in the middle ages, I might think this has healing properties. In fact, I think I might be coming down with something (bit of a sore throat), but this is curing me up nicely. Hearing reviews saying it's too green so I'm glad I sat on my can for a month.

Brilliant marigold haze on the pour, capped by a stunning billowy white head that sticks around longer than J Lo's a$$ when she's leaving the room. Aromas of creamy mango custard, a light herbal effervescence, and subtle notes of tropical fruit. Taste follows with a battle for superiority between lemon curd, mango lassi, and pineapple. There's a touch of heat on the back end, but it does not diminish or overwhelm the palate. Soft, chewy, and fully mouthcoating, this beer seduces you with each sip taken.

Unsure fresh, but this beer at 8 months is a monster across the board.
Gorgeous slightly orange hinted golden yellow; hazy with a creamy thick white head… which breaks down into layers of dense foam that cascade in multiple halos within glass.
Nose is citric orange; grass; melon, double bubble . Flavor mirrors with more noticeable apricot tartness and some banana like richness coming through as well.
Body is velvety smooth only lightly carbonated. Rich but not heavy or sluggish. Not for everyone but spot on in my wheel house. Seems almost hand pulled from cask. Absolutely no double digit ABV noticeable at all. Mastercrafting here.

Aroma struck me as a mix of mild grapefruit and citric hops along with smidge of tropical fruits and floral notes. Fuller-bodied, slightly sticky, a touch of booze and maltiness in the beer but mostly a tropical fruit sweetness that balances with a floral hoppiness and then a touch of citric zip on the finish. Great balance between different aspects and well-hidden booze make this an enjoyable beer.",4.18

Crazy, ridiculous long lasting head and thick lacing. Really something else for a beer of this ABV. Super green hops and sweaty gym clothes followed by bubble gum, berries, mango.....

Man, I can’t remember the last new Stout I had from Tree House. They tend to excel at these Milk Stouts, so I have high hopes for this one. Plus this is one of the last few TH beers in the BA top 250 I’ve yet to rate, so I’m excited to finish up that list

Pours nearly pitch black with a finger of mocha head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is certainly sweet in aroma, but it’s not overbearing. I’m picking up on aromas of milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, chewy caramel, sweet vanilla, light cinnamon, and a touch of char

There’s actually a pretty good sense of balance here in taste, I wasn’t expecting a dry finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, chewy caramel, raisin, creamy coffee, brown sugar, light cherry, and cocoa powder. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, dark cherry, medium roast coffee, brown sugar, light caramel, and roasted malt

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a thick and creamy beer. Dries out over the duration of the swallow, leaving just the slightest stickiness

A huge shoutout to merpunk1 for hooking me up with this one in a trade! It’s the highest rated Bière de Champagne (and #245 overall), so it’s only fitting to drink this baby on New Years Eve. The rest of the day/night will consist of old classics, but it’s nice to open something fancy for my last review of 2021. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with a finger of white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing. Eventually fades to absolutely nothing but it's still a decent looking beer

Man, I'm really digging the nose on this one, funky and delicate at the same time. I'm picking up on aromas of white grape, white wine vinegar, tangerine, sharp oak, and earthy apple

It's straight up explosive in taste, in your face and complex while being downright drinkable. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting tart green apple, sour white grape, wet hay, sharp oak, lemon zest, and crackery malt. The swallow brings notes of earthy white white, old leather, tart white grape, apple skin, sharp oak, floral honey, and lemon zest

A light medium body pairs with fine carbonation, resulting in a tart and crisp beer. Finishes mostly dry with just a touch of residual sweetness

It's taste is sublime; funky, oaky white wine grape with soft notes of peach that sweeten the Brettanomyces and native Missouri microflora. It's so delicate and fine.

Silky black with a minimal bubbly head.

Aroma of huge spices and hot fudge, with emphasis on nutmeg, vanilla, and cinnamon, but with extended depth and oak sweetness. Slightly coffee, with coconut and more fudge.

The beer is like your childhood - but barrel aged. Huge fucking BARREL AGED nutmeg in your face. Cinnamon. It's so Christmas-y, and rich and full. Tons of fudge in the background with hot caramel sauce and peppermint coffee. Fading notes of nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, fudge, and bourbon. This is magic.

Feel is a bit thin from the barrel but still within thick stout territory. Alcohol heat is evident and welcome, with a slightly slick feel and a hot finish. Good carbonation too.

Overall,. an absolutely phenomenal, incredible beer that I wish I could find here in Tulsa to take home via package liquor but unfortunately could not. Do not waste your time on mediocre beer. Life is too short. That is the greatest lesson I have learned in 3,000+ beers. If they suck, walk. Prairie does not. Worth the $17, even at the bar. Created a memory burned into my brain.

Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb!,"If the emperor gets to wear new clothes then this king of stouts dons its Christmas attire! This time enveloped in bourbon drenched Santa suit, the flavors of the Christmas Bomb! imperial stout are brought to the palate with generous additions of holiday spice and the warmth of the bourbon barrel.

Much like thatch, the Barrel Aged Christmas Bomb layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying a mirror-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, holiday spice, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla, whisky and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with toffee, vanilla, molasses and a general gingerbread flavor before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.

Develops a more earthy character through the middle palate, those fresh flavors are decadent with bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut in its bitterness power. A syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove and vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel, toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.

Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of good 'ole Kentucky bourbon, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a simmering warmth of holiday spice in mulled ale form.",4.49

A combination of wine barrels, orange, lemon and miscellaneous tropical fruits burst from the glass. Maybe a little bit of tart funk, but it definitely takes a back seat.

On the tongue, the funk is much more present. The taste leads with wine barrel / oak funk. Mid palate I get some tropical notes, along with wildflowers. I don't believe any dandelions are in this beer, but to me it tastes like they are. On the very long finish, the funk has more of an earthy feel. Surprisingly full body. Well carbonated and smooth, despite a bit of acidity.

Overall, this is an excellent beer. Complex and layered in a way I don't often see. The barrels really add to the experience. An excellent example of what happens when skill and patience combine.",4.47
Juicy,New Zealand inspired beer - aged in wine barrels for 8 months and is fruity and a darker color. Tasted of wine and some sharpness as well in this beer.,4.38
Juicy,"Alan, thank you so much for this one.

2019 vintage - 375ml bottle - poured into a Zinfandel stem at 45°F.

With a loud, forceful *POP* of the cap, Juicy pours a slightly foggy deep burnish orange-amber hue - rather dark, forming just a razor-thin collar with some slow lazy rising bubbles.

Nose: My goodness, this is striking. This is a mandarin orange - freshly peeled and squeezed until the juice begins to run. Not naval, not Cara Cara, not mineola - mandarin - joined by gooseberry, white grape, Meyer lemon, apricot, gingerbeer, green apple, cloudberry jam, all swirling amidst some subtle barnyard funk, wet hay, petrichor, cellar stone, wet leaves, wine-soaked oak, old books, some zesty acidity, and these immensely complex perfume notes. This may be the single most impressive aroma I've encountered. My first ever 5 on anything. I don't hand those out...

Palate: Juicy greets the palate with that soft, restrained Hill Farmstead tartness - citrusy - with a noticeable malt sweetness behind it. There's almost some IPA influence, with juicy flavours of grapefruit, pineapple, fresh grass, gooseberry, white grape, and some serious sauvignon blanc influence. Mid-way, the subtle acidity fades, revealing some grainy malt, and a musty, overripe dankness emerges. The brighter fruity notes begin to give in to some grassy character, orange pith, lime leaf, and some bitter peach pit. Some resinous Nelson hop character emerges, still bacled by some lemon zest, and then vinous wine cask, tannic grape skin, and lightly bitter hop resinous waft through the finish.

Mouthfeel/Body: The ale is medium-bodied, with a touch of weight to it, despite its small size. Effervescence is ultra-fine - on par with champagne, but much, much softer. Some dry tartness up front, fading to semi-dry with grain poking through, and then finishing mostly dry, with some tannins and resinous hop oil cling.

Overall: This is a truly spectacular example of what creativity, nuance, and new boundaries can achieve. This farmhouse ale displays a rare quality of not really having an equal - as in, nothing really compares to it. It's a saison, but it has some pale ale spirit, but it Nelson-hopped, with theae heady, exotic elements that pair seamlessly and beautifully with the wine barrel, and everything about it is so perfectly rounded and softened, like a river rock smoothed by the waters of time. One of those rare, inspiring bottles that just sings in harmony.",4.61

Vineous and tart on the palate with undertones of Burgundy, citrus, and apples. Finishes fairly dry with some lingering tannins, red fruit, and grapeskins.

Fruit there from the nose, increasing as it’s warmed. Again grapefruit and pineapple, more of that orange as well as apricot. Medium long finish

But this didn’t overwhelm me with tart at all. Just a great blend and very easy going down. I know it’s not a sour but if it was it would be my favorite of all that I have had. Pours a light color, slight head, not much lacing, lingered nicely in my mouth and I could smell it just when I opened it before I poured it. Wonderful beer.

Bourbon, molasses, winter spices, baker's chocolate, fresh dates, and roast malt in the nose.

Flavor follows the nose but with significantly more intensity and complexity. Rye and hops blend together with a bit of heat from the alcohol. Long, even, medium-dry finish with hints of loam and char. Faint tobacco, vanilla, and coconut emerge as the ale warms.

Medium bodied, faintly oily, with low but sufficient carbonation.

Roasty and toasty malts lay underneath, keeping the beer from listing into sugary, and doing their darndest at that. A touch of barrel char at the end insures balance. Mouth feel is thick with a consistent, creamy texture. That creaminess keeps it easy to drink despite the alcohol content or the weight of each sip. Overall, smooth and bold with a focused push of vanilla bean

Draft. Reviewed from notes.",4.3
Darkstar November,"Pours a deep black color with a thin tan colored head that laces a bit on the way down. Smells of sweet deep roasted malts, a nice rye spice, and some brown sugar/molasses sweetness to it. It's not as sweet as it smells but it is still sweet. Roasted malt body with a nice rye spice mixed with molasses at the end is really nice. Smooth, velvety, perfect amount of carbonation. Bottle Logic knocks it out of the park on this one.",5.0
Darkstar November,"2019 release. I received this from @2beerdogs. Poured into a snifter. It pours nearly black with a full finger of creamy, medium-mocha lacing with excellent retention considering the alcohol level. On the nose there is roasted malt, char, tobacco smoke, toffee, and a strong scent of bourbon. The taste is considerably sweeter than the smell would indicate. It opens with fudgy chocolate, vanilla, and molasses with hints of dark fruit in the background. The Buffalo Trace bourbon is strong and warming but the overall flavor has a soft quality. Its mouth feel is plush and creamy with lite/moderate carbonation, and I can really feel the 14.09% ABV. Overall, Darkstar November is a huge Russian Imperial Stout with loads of flavor. It's a great sipper and I'm grateful to have tried it.",4.44

LOOK: Motor oil black color, small light brown head. excellent retention

AROMA: wow. lots of wood and spice mixed in with wonderful roasted malts. just the right touches of chocolate, vanilla, whiskey.

Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Decent vanilla character, some oaky barrel notes, plenty of spice from the habaneros and a spicy cinnamon note that hits in just the right spot. Very good beer.",3.75
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a small, fizzy head that quickly recedes. Smells of slightly roasted, caramel malt and distinct chocolate and vanilla notes, as well as some cinnamon and hints of licorice and oak. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, caramel malt, strong milk chocolate and vanilla, lighter cinnamon and chili heat, as well as hints of dark fruit, with accents of raisin and fig, licorice, leather and bourbon-infused oak. Finishes with a light sweetness and some chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and a pleasant chili heat lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light/medium carbonation.

It's been so long since I managed to get my hands on a decent mexican chocolate stout, so this BBA brew goes down a real treat. I've had regular Oro Negro before and really enjoyed it, while the BBA version feels a lot richer, with the bourbon character coming through marvellously here. While this also makes the beer a little bit more sweet and boozy, with that bourbon and additional vanilla notes really standing out, the spice and roasted notes balance this out very nicely, with the chili heat being just right for my personal taste. Overall, this makes for a very rich mexican chocolate stout with an excellent balance of sweet and spicy notes and a great bourbon character, as well as full body and mouthfeel.",4.47

Overall - pretty tasty Mexican ba stout",4.58
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Modest head production and retention, but it's not completely still.

Wonderful aroma. Bourbon isn't as prominent as other Jackie O's BBA stouts. Smooth and semi-sweet, with vegetal pepper notes along chocolate and vanilla.

Really nice melange of flavors on the palate. Peppers are very restrained, noticeable for my palate only from very large sips - but I get very little pepper in chili beers normally unless it's strong and prominent. Chocolate is rich and smooth; the vanilla is complementary; I don't get any cinnamon; the bourbon, as with the nose, is restrained but wonderfully complementary. Overall flavor is a big, semi-sweet imperial stout, arguably more of a dessert stout than a chili stout - quite reminiscent of the last few years of Mexican Cake.

Mouthfeel is adequately full and lively; I would prefer both more thickness and more activity, but it's a very drinkable beer.",4.26
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"Pours inky black with minimal head. Aroma of roasted almonds, chocolate syrup on the nose. Some vanilla and oak as well. Lots of chocolatey notes in this one. Some vanilla and oaky burn on the finish. It's not super sweet, but there's enough sweetness. It's lean and doesn't have the heft of the some of the thiccer bois you hear a lot about these days. The heat from the habañero burn is unignorable on this hot summer day and the idea that it's always stout season seems incomprehensible at the moment. This is a nice stout though and it's always cool to get a top 250 beer in distro.",4.21
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"12 oz bottle, poured into a goblet at 40 degrees F and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Poured an inky black with no real head to speak of, and what little did form vanished quite swiftly.

S: Thick black bread leapt out of the bottle upon the cap being removed, and swirled in the air during the pour. Alongside it, blackstrap molasses, petrichor with fresh herb garden topsoil, chopped walnut, and oaky booze are prominent in the nose when cold. As it warms, the walnut aroma becomes far more prevalent.

T: When cold, this opens as a mouthful of herb garden soil just after a spring rain, with both chopped walnut and wet green walnut husk present. Black bread lurks in the background, and oaky tannic barrel notes slither around the edges. The aftertaste contains a touch of spicy heat. As it warms, those characteristics remain, but additional layers begin to appear - some dark sugary fruit like raisins, figs, and dates, molasses, a tinge of leather, and some distant cocoa. The heat remains in the aftertaste.

F: Full and thick, this brings to mind liquid bread blended to syrup.

O: This is a complex delight of a barrel-aged stout. But hey, it's Jackie O's. They're not exactly a slouch of a brewery.",4.79
Bourbon Barrel Oro Negro,"A- 375ml bottle pours into a tulip glass with a motor oil black body. The foam that forms on the beer is a light brown and has a puffy texture. The head rises to a finger high and has decent retention. Not a ton of lacing but a few small webs and some spottiness.

S- Woah, didn't expect the walnuts to make a massive difference but the first thing I smell upon pouring the bottle, from a few feet away, is toasted walnuts. The nuts combine with the roasted malts, which are chocolately and fudgey, as well as some caramel notes to remind me of turtles or a nutty, caramel chocolate treat. Bourbon barrel comes next with some vanilla sweets, slight wood and hints of whiskey. Strong cocoa as well as hints of earthy cinnamon. Not picking up on the peppers here.

T- Not quite as nutty as the aroma but the walnuts are still present throughout and one of the main flavors along with the cocoa and the barrel which gains considerable strength on the palate. A bit of habanero heat in the finish but no obvious pepper flavor, which is probably a good thing if we are being honest. Vanilla beans are strong with caramel, milk chocolate, roast barley, spicy Bourbon, medium toast oak and spicy cinnamon notes.

MF- Medium bodied and a little bit thinner than I expected after smelling and tasting this one. I guess it just lacks creaminess and is lightly frothy instead. Fairly slick and oily but not syrupy. The carbonation is moderate and it finishes with moderate alcohol warming and some heat from the peppers.

Reminds me of a walnut, caramel and chocolate cluster and I am impressed by how much the walnuts are expressed in the final brew. The flavor is where things really balance out nicely but the body could be just a bit creamier if I am being honest.",4.29
The Abyss,"12oz bottled 4/28/21 (nearly one year ago) poured into a perfect pint glass at fridge temp 11.8% ABV per label. The beer pours pitch black with no light penetration and light brown head. The head recedes to a thin ring and single layer of tiny bubbles. Sparce lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring chocolate, roasted malt and oak barrel. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with more subtle oak, bitter chocolate and a moderately bitter finish. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with just less that average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. The substantial ABV is well hidden. Overall, very good.",4.11

""Brewed with blackstrap molasses and licorice, cherry bark, vanilla bean, 50% is aged in bourbon, wine, and oak"". Scored this bad-boy pre-aged from the best beer store in the state (shhhh... it was $6)

Pours up black, smelling boozy and woody. This is breakfast in my ****ed-up world, cheers! Extremely milk chocolate sweet but the sweetness is thankfully cut by the barrel and spirits. But still, molasses, raisin, mocha coffee dominate. It's drinkable, but HOT, even considering the 11.4%. Other 'competitors' cover up the alc more betterer, but maybe that's the point here. If you are a boozer, you may appreciate this aspect more; me, I'm a beer'er and this is too busy to be beer. I'm a purist in a weird way, and this just has too much going on. The wine and oak don't add anything, it's just all harsh grain alcohol cutting through saccharine dark fruit. Perfectly drinkable, but why?",2.98
The Abyss,"Has anyone ever said, “I cannot wait to drink this glass of what looks like boiled motor oil?” Well motor oil comes out of the container looking more like an IPA so that adjective (oily) never seemed correct. Dirty motor oil, I guess.
If my car ran on The Abyss I would do much more walking and biking.
It’s dark. Like an abyss! Wow, ironic!
It smells like cocoa malt candy joy. It smells like Jamaican Blue Mountain if it was half as good as they say.
The taste absolutely follows. It’s all been said before. Malty chocolate caramel licorice dark fruit heaven. It’s good! There’s some alcohol in that taste, however, more than most are willing to say.
You guys try that French toast version that’s around in 2021? Odd! Add cinnamon and maple to the above and you have it.
It’s good. As I have said here before, better does exist. BBA Darkness, for example. But Abyss is lovely!",4.58
The Abyss,"Crowler split with a friend. Picked up at Sabatinis in Exeter Pa a week ago

Looks decent enough in a large wine glass. Jet black body, small tan head doesn't last too long, hence not much lacing.

Faintly boozy aroma, almost RIS-like. A little molasses, faint smoke.

On tasting, the roast is pretty strong on this one. There are some dark fruit notes, and some warmth from the barrel. Light bourbon notes. Does feel smooth rolling around the tongue. Some molasses, and even faint soy.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a warm boozy roast.

Abraxas,"Well i traveled north to a beer joint i'd never been to before but i knew they had good ratings and were a well liked store. Mack's Beverage in Parma, Ohio. Well yes, the place was very cool and had a lot to choose from. But i was really surprised to see multiple vintages of Abraxas on the shelf. The different years were different prices so i just bought the oldest and most expensive one which was a 2020. $25. Worth a try. Poured into a snifter and man that head just disappeared as soon as i poured it. Color was dark brown. The smell is sweet like cocoa and coffee, with a tinge of spiciness to it that tingles the nose a bit. Taste is rich and velvety, warm smooth melting chocolate and a slight bitterness of coffee. Yes the cinnamon is also there enriching the experience. I'm looking for more chili pepper in the beer. It's slight but not nearly strong enough to get my top marks. I like it when the beer bites back. Mouthfeel is thick, rich, and full, bubbling only the slightest bit. Another reviewer compared this to Christmas Bomb and Xocoveza, and having had both those beers, I would say this rates pretty highly up there with both of those brews. Overall this is an awesome beer, and definitely one of the better stouts i've tried. There's nothing spectacularly unique about it, but as far as a stout goes, this sets the bar pretty high, manifesting what a stout can be if it's done well and done right. Cheers!",4.25

Abraxas,"Got this bottle in December 2017 and the age mellowed out the alcohol burn. It poured as black as ink with a small brown head that faded slowly and left basically zero lacing. It smells of cinnamon, dark chocolate, burnt coffee grinds and roasted peppers up front, followed by cocoa powder, brown sugar, charred wood and cooking spices. The ABV was quite subdued in the nose.

Tastes of dark chocolate and smoked chili peppers up front, followed by cinnamon, milk chocolate, burnt coffee grinds, roasted grains, cocoa powder, brown sugar, molasses, red wine, charred wood and cooking spices. The flavor has a lot of smoky, charred aspects but still does down easy like a well aged bourbon. The char and oaky components give it some hints of vanilla and campfire smoke, while covering up the ABV. Pretty smooth drinking for a heavy stout, this was quite enjoyable.",4.26

Abraxas,"Crowler filled at Half Time in Mamaroneck on 3/26/22, unknown vintage but presumably the latest release from 2021

Yet another legendary Stout acquired at Half Time yesterday! The difference in rankings between this and the barrel aged version of it is shocking to me, at #245 vs #3, respectively. Still, I’m expecting a quality beer with this one. Let’s get into it

Pours jet black with a finger of dark tan head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The peppery spice in the nose is really nice, it combines well with everything. I’m picking up on aromas of chipotle pepper, earthy cinnamon, roasty coffee, milk chocolate, spicy whiskey, light raisin, and vanilla

The balance carries over into taste, with the pepper adding a nice but firm spice. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting milk chocolate, cocoa powder, sweetened coffee, chili pepper, dates, and vanilla. The swallow brings notes of earthy cinnamon, cocoa powder, vanilla, spicy whiskey, roasty coffee, and toasted oak

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a nice sweetness

This is a very good beer. The balance is really nice and nothing is overwhelming. I can’t wait to try the BA version",4.49
Abraxas,"Perennial Abraxas Imperial Stout 2021, 11.5% ABV. Pours black and thick with a one-finger medium brown head that left no lacing but the cap lingered. Nose is chocolate, cinnamon, and faint peppers. Taste follows, weak pepper, plus vanilla. The more it warmed, the cinnamon really popped, nose and taste. Excellent smooth and thick mouthfeel, overall world class. Way better than Prairie Bomb or Stone Xocoveza.",4.48
Abraxas,"If you're a fan of Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, then congrats - you're already a fan of Abraxas.

A pretty leisurely pour into an imperial pint glass produced a thick, beautiful 4 inch tan head. The head itself appeared slowly and almost dramatically, and only after I'd stopped pouring. It breaks down slowly, forming a 1/2"" cap with fantastic lacing.

Smelled of molasses, cinnamon, cacao, and chilies. This is a beautiful aroma, very reminiscent of Christmas Bomb, but smoother and more refined.

Taste followed the nose, but with pronounced maltiness that really ties the whole thing together. Too often, winter releases use cinnamon either to conceal deficiencies or act as second fiddle to sugar or honey. Abraxas employs the chilies and cinnamon to great effect, creating a flavor profile that perfectly compliments the vanilla and cacao. To drink this brew is to drink mastery in action.

The mouthfeel of this beer is complex. Drink it before the head dissipates, and you have a milkshake. Drink it after the head reduces down to a 1/2"" cap, and you have a thick, viscous, smooth delight. Very light carbonation.

I paid around $25 for a 750ml bottle, and it was worth every penny. This is perfect for a Christmas get together, or just a cold winter night. Most definitely in the same class as Christmas Bomb or Xocoveza, but Abraxas is the elder statesman of the group. Buy it, and be prepared to be amazed.",4.79
Abraxas,"A: pours opaque black with a thick, dark brown , 4 finger head that slowly dissolves to a 1/4"" cap. Lots of lacy legging on the sides on the draw down.

F: Viscous and smooth on the tongue. Light to almost non-existent carbonation.

O: A supreme Russian imperial stout with chilies. A little expensive but worth it.",4.65

Served in a snifter, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch or so frothy tan head that stuck around a while. There's also a good amount of lacing. I like the aroma, the brew smells like Ancho chilies, cinnamon, vanilla, roasted malt, cacao nibs and some earthiness. For the most part I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some dark bread, coffee and burnt/charred malt flavors. I think all the flavors mesh well together with no one flavor overpowering the others. Mouthfeel/body is full, it's creamy and coating with a low/moderate amount of carbonation. Easy and enjoyable to drink for sure. I thought this was a pretty good overall brew, worth picking up if you get the chance!",4.53

Abraxas,"The first time I've tried this was on Valentines day at a dinner at one of my favorite restaurants w/ beer pairings with Perennial beer. It was one that really stood out and I enjoyed them all. Had it a few months after that because I found it at my favorite beer shop(the only place I know that almost exclusively sells nothing but beer and a small selection of liquor). It was just as good as the first time. The only beer I've had that's similar in taste to this is Firestone-Walker's Mole Merkin. There's a ton of flavor in this beer but they all mix together quite wonderfully. This is one of my favorite beers, I'm big on stouts and this one is up there with the best of em . Update for 2021-2022 version, it was as good as the first time I've tried it. One of my all time favorite beers, I can't recommended it enough!

It smells like molasses, chocolate, cinnamon, vanilla, and hints of toffee. The taste is truly incredible. At lower temperatures the chocolate and alcoholic sweetness take the center stage with vanilla extract like aftertaste. The flavor gets better as it warms and almost taste likes a dark chocolate cinnamon roll. It's very very thick and completely coats the mouth, but it's slightly carbonated and much more refreshing than anyone could ever expect. It goes down illegally smoothly for a 12% beer. Overall very very good, don't pass this up if you have a chance to grab it on tap.",4.71
Stickee Monkee,"The beer is mahogany, dark brown color. The beer fizz with sound while pouring, but leaves a thin layer of foam only, which disappears very quickly. The beer smells dark, smoky, brown sugar, coffee, leather, molasses and whiskey barrel oaky. The wooden, oaky barrel aroma is distinct, it’s clearly a barrel-aged strong ale.

The beer is full bodied, velvety, latte creamy, with a bit of fizz tickling on tongue. The beer is moderate sweet (it’s 2016 bottle? 6 years later it’s still not dry?), with a bold palate, with a bit sour (tart cherry), light bitter and subtle salty at back. The taste is great, renders the beer bold, but the flavor is on the stout side than a quad (which should be drier?) to me. The malty backbone is strong, and there’s dark sugar (Turbinado brown sugar from Mexico) added which is not that fruity but with molasses and toffee candy hints. When I sip, I sense some dark chocolate, roasted chestnut nutty, alcohol burn, salted toffee candy, leather and tobacco earthiness, whiskey filled chocolate bottle, dried fig and raisin aromas. The beer taste bold, very malty and dark sugar characters, but it’s not ester heavy nor fruity. My feeling of this beer is a serious gentleman who will not wink or smile, but just sitting still and sipping cigar. This is a malty beverage, really malty, I think it may need another 5 years of aging to became more mellow. I expect more layers in this beer, but currently it’s just a bit too sweet (malty) to enjoy.",4.22

Stickee has always been a favorite for me. I love a great quad and Firestone does an amazing job adding a barrel aged component. The nose is wonderful. The barrel is prominent and it’s perfectly sweet. I don’t know what the aging has done to this bottle. It’s super smooth but was it harsh before? I doubt it. I’d probably drink this fresh in the future. A world class beer and perhaps the best quad you can find? One day I’ll find a Westy 12 to test that theory.",4.51

T: Taste is caramel and toffee up front before some dark fruits come in. Nice bready malt with a huge amount of sugary sweetness along with some hints of oak and vanilla. On the swallow there's more brown sugar sweetness, dark fruits, caramel, toffee, oak, and vanilla.
M: This beer is on the heavier side of things with a silky feel on the palate. Carbonation is soft but adequate for the style while the ABV ensures that this beer has a dying finish.

Samuel Adams Utopias,"Not sure it's worth the price tag, but the 2021 vintage really did live up to the appropriate hype. It's super solid, and the caramel and sherry notes remind me a little of a barleywine - but it's its own animal. Definitely glad to tick this.",4.59
Samuel Adams Utopias,"This is my review of the 2021 edition of Utopias. I regret missing missing the previous editions, this is my first. With much anticipation I waited for my local Total Wine to show it in stock & rushed over to hesitantly with $240. I’m more than a bit thrifty but I wanted to try this legendary brew. I ordered proper glassware to serve this ‘“beer”. Poured into a Glencairn whiskey glass, the headless, reddish liquid was a perfect match of the mahogany trim on my Stressless recliner. Aroma, I can’t imagine anything prettier, it would make a great perfume: bourbon, sherry, wine, caramel, maple & an abundance of barrel aromas. Flavor: far more complex flavors than my meeker palate can discern but here are few I can pick out, bourbon, wine, caramel, ripe fruit, vanilla with maple & tart cherries at the finish. There is no carbonation but plenty of alcohol, this definitely a sipper. It is delicious & it’s aroma is heavenly. Is it worth the high price? Probably not. Will I try another in future?

Samuel Adams Utopias,"Is this a beer? Convince me! I bit the bullet when my local brew shop procured a trio of these for customers with more cash than sense. I've still got the bottle here on my desk, and it's a good way to start conversations with fellow hop heads.

Zero head, zero carbonation. A dark amber color that smells like a strong port. It tastes kind of like a port that was made from raisins and maple syrup instead of grapes. The mouthfeel is weirdly oily, probably due to the use of maple syrup in the brewing process. Best enjoyed in moderation, because it's gone before you know it.

I'm glad I had the experience, but I can't see myself getting it again. It's just way too expensive for what you get. The oily character was a little off-putting to me, and while I liked the strong raisin flavor, I wasn't as fond of the maple. And in no way is it experienced like something you'd call ""beer."" You take careful shots, there's no carbonation, and it's stronger than many cocktails.

It's probably not fair for me to call it ""overrated,"" and given the expense of brewing it, I can't quite say it's overpriced. But the experience was more costly than it was worth for me.",4.54

Samuel Adams Utopias,"L:. Pours a a brilliant chestnut brown with no carbonation and no head, looks more like a hard alcohol than a beer.

S:. Leads off with a sweet nose of molasses and maple syrup, quite reminiscent of whiskey, with a note of vanilla and cinnamon, some notes dark fruits and a light cherry, does remind me of a barley wine. Booze is noticeable.

T:. The strong booze coats the tongue first, followed by mounds of sweet maple and molasses, becomes quite reminiscent of whiskey, some notes of vanilla and a light cinnamon, don't get a tone of the cherry but a very slight note of them. Once again the booze is noticeable and drinks a lot more like hard liquor than beer.

Samuel Adams Utopias,"2019 vintage

Here we are BA, my personal whale. Sam Adams Utopias. Me and my buddy Pru managed to find a bottle about 2 hours from home because we just couldn’t wait for this year’s release. This is also beer #800 for me! I’m very excited to break into this, so I’m gonna stop wasting time and open it up

Obviously this is not a beautiful pour for beer, but the presentation of the bottle alone is worth a 5. Pours clear dark amber with no head but nice legs

It’s very evident that this was brewed with maple syrup, as the nose is a mapley booze bomb. I’m picking up on aromas of spicy bourbon, sticky maple, cinnamon, sweet vanilla, rum raisin, smooth oak, dark cherry, cocoa powder, brown sugar, and a touch of honey

This is super sweet in taste, somewhere in between a barleywine and a bourbon or cognac. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting strong maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, cinnamon, dried plum, and burnt sugar. The swallow has a pretty decent burn and brings notes of sweet maple syrup, black cherry, spicy bourbon, buttery oak, brown sugar, creamy vanilla, dried plum, sherry, fig, and a touch of cocoa

A medium full body with almost no carbonation, just an alcoholic tingle resulting in a rich beer. Finishes somewhat dry but quite sweet

This is not necessarily an amazing beer, and not even necessarily a beer. However, it’s really a once in a lifetime experience, and I am thoroughly enjoying it. To good beer and better freiends!",4.37
Samuel Adams Utopias,"Excited to finally have a Utopias. Only a 2019 but the experience of unboxing it and pouring the bottle is second to none. Sharing this bottle with my bud Rug. Based off looks, phenomenal. Never before had to unbox a beer. Smells strong, gives a bourbon vibe and hints of cinnamon. Slightly burns to smell but that’s to be expected with a beer of this alcohol percentage. Tastes strongly of maple syrup, and bourbon. Hints of cinnamon in the background. Medium feel, finishes sticky. Overall a phenomenal experience. Not anything phenomenal to the senses, but one any craft beer fan should have.",3.91
Samuel Adams Utopias,"2007 vintage - First opened July 4, 2021 - Review on July 6, 2021.

This beer looks thick as heck while pouring. It's a red/brown color coming from the bottle. There's no head at all, which doesn't surprise me one bit, based on the age and ABV.
The nose is out of this world. In a way, to me, it smells like a fine bourbon. Very boozy, first off. I get tons of caramel, toffee, chocolate, raisin, plum, and so much more that I can't fully describe. This is an outstanding aroma.
Taste - I know I won't do justice to this - Chocolate is up front, as is the raisin and plum. It then goes to the back to toffee and caramel. I'm also getting vanilla in the mix. This is really only a small portion of the flavors I'm getting overall, but I just can't put words to them.
Body - Up front there's a bit of a burn from the alcohol, but WAY less than the ABV would suggest. It then turns to a smooth, almost creamy feeling, that is so smooth and easy drinking.
This is worth the hype, and I'm so happy I got the chance to get a bottle. Being in the liquor business now, I'm going to try to get another the next time it comes out, just to see the difference between vintages.",4.97
DBR,"22oz bottle, taken from notes of Aug 2017

Pours black in color with a one-finger foamy khaki head that reduces to a ring around the edge. Smells of oaky bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, toffee and light coconut. Tastes of bold roasted notes up front give chocolate and char, followed by a compliment of barrel juice, oak, vanilla and caramel. The coconut develops near the finish, as well as more roast and barrel character. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming finish",4.42
DBR,"Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. 22 oz bottle from the purchase at the brewery on 12/1/17 (Greatest Hits batch). Reviewed on 1/1/18. Poured into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.

A: Very dark brown to black, and opaque. A minimum of visible carbonation, and only a tan ring of foam. The foam stays around, but no real head formation.

S: Bourbon, chocolate, caramel, vanilla. Waffle cones and tobacco. Dark roasted malts with a modest roasty bitterness. Mild oak tannins. Quite a nice aroma, especially for non-adjunct stout.

T: Bourbon and dark chocolate, vanilla and caramel. Sticky dark roasted malts, milder coffee, Oak, tannins, more vanilla. Some drying tobacco within the tannins as well. Then more sweet bourbon and chocolate in the hang.

M: A nice heavy, thick and sticky body. Carbonation is low but fine for style. The alcohol flavors are very, very well-hidden for the monster ABV listed. Good barrel balance as well – obvious bourbon flavors but still lets the other flavors come out.

O: So…this is an excellent beer. Big sweet dark malty beer with good barrel presence and thick mouthfeel. BUT…I just had the Calusa Barrel-Aged Sworn to the Dark – and I think I might prefer the Calusa. It’s not a huge gap, and it’s rather like picking between a Ferrari and a Lamborghini, since I really liked both of them. Would drink this one again in a heartbeat.",4.31
DBR,"Great Hits DBR bottle. Strong, rich chocolate. As has been my experience with many Cycle beers, the barrel is very mild and subdued - there's a light woody presence to the beer, but the alcohol is very well blended. It's soft and quite drinkable, even given the ABV. I really liked this one - wish I hadn't shared mine!",4.41

overall: many similarities to westy 12, but a bit more toned down, less sweet.",4.5
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Pours a firm burgundy color with a little haze to the transparency. A little protein build up floats in the glass. The first 3/4 of the bottle was poured into the glass for this review, with more sediment in the final quarter. Head is three fingers of off-white foam, which retains well. Aroma is sticky caramel, toffee, raisins, and bread pudding. A little yeast spice counters the initial sugary notes, with bready, caramely, light earthy malts firming up the whole thing. Clove adds a bit of herbal bite to the mid-section. Flavor profile is raisins, toffee, molasses, cinnamon, and almonds. Spicy yeast esters work well with bready, caramely, earthy malts to balance out the initial sugary notes, without smothering them out. In total, it has a hearty bread pudding taste without being over zealous in sweetness. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a soft, expansive effervescence that seems to feel bigger at the end than the start. This effect helps create a comforting, full feeling. Overall, some great malt and flavor undertones in both nose and taste. A comfortable blanket of a beer.

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"330mL bottle (best by 10/23/2019, so bottled 10/23/2016) into a Westmalle chalice.

Pours a slightly hazy deep mahogany with minimal head, lots of tiny floaties suspended throughout, steady carbonation rising to the surface.

Aroma is bready and sweet with notes of figs and dates, candi sugar, caramel. Delicate and nicely balanced.

Taste is likewise bready, balanced, and complex. One thing that stands out here, that I often don’t notice, is the quality of the water—clean and refreshing with a subtle mineral quality, like a cold spring. Caramel, dark stone fruits, Belgian yeast. Some vaguely wintery spice and subtle Old World hops.

Mouthfeel is balanced and medium bodied with perfect carbonation. Finishes clean and crisp, just right.

Overall, and not surprisingly, we have here a truly excellent, world-class dubbel. Maybe one of the best ones I’ve ever had.",4.47
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Pours a deep, dark brown coloration with a medium, fluffy, lasting head. Smells of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt and estery fruit and spice, with just a hint of dark fruit and chocolate also coming through. Taste is an excellent balance of slightly roasted, bready, caramel malt, chocolate and dark and estery fruit and spice, with notes of raisin, fig, banana, clove and allspice, as well as hints of licorice and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes bittersweet, with notes of estery fruity and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This actually feels very close to their Quadrupel for me, except maybe being not quite as rich, a little more carbonated and just a tad more roasted and bitter. For my personal taste, I probaly prefer it, to be honest. Still, without being quite worth its secondary price, this makes for a very impressive Dubbel that just stands slightly above offering such as Westmalle, St. Bernadus and Chimay due to its richness, balance and above all body and mouthfeel, with the estery character really standing out here.",4.43
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Boom! Boom! Boom! Like Northeudge in ‘94 or Tupac shooting a music video, this one shakes, rattles, and rolls! This one is like Barry Bonds on roids…oh wait, he already was.

Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"Blind-tasted except for the beer's name and brewery/country, zero reviews below read (yet!)...
L- Even rested/chilled it forms head really fast, so pour super-slow. Pours deep chestnut brown with slight haze and a mid-tan 6Cm head. There's fast rising CO2 micro-bubbles up the side of the nucleated glass. ps. Holds well and forms major lacing on the way down.
S- Strikingly deeply toasty and rich malts; it makes me imagine how a bag of ground up Maltesers might smell.
T- Again very malty, deep roasty, a notably fat but classy ABV% note crosses my palate, off into hops, then further rich malts and into a hoppier somewhat dry finish. Solid yet refined. Blimey, if you think this beer's reputation is hype, wait until you try it!
F- Rich deep roasty, the ABV% is clear enough it's similar to some liquor barrel aged beers.
O- I picked this one for my 1950th review (the WestV12 will mark B2k). I was conscious of the brewery's repute and hype surrounding it, the difficulty getting their beer etc etc. Would I be underwhelmed, would I be underwhelmed but feel somehow obliged to rate it high. No way at all, this is a seriously luscious beer. Now perhaps some people might not like the fact that a 'mere' 8% beer lets you get an ABV% zing from it - some regard this as unclassy - but it works well within the rather glorious whole for me.
I'd happily drink this again, hell-ya, just maybe not at the cost it is imported into the UK!

The pour is mahogany brown with reddish hues under a boisterous, fluffy light tan head.

Lovely malt forward aroma sensations with Belgian spices and Belgian candied sugar.

The body was medium or better and smooth.

The taste is a luscious malt forward sweetness with Belgian candied sugars and the slightest clove and coriander character. Just delightful.",4.66
Trappist Westvleteren 8 (VIII),"A relatively gentle pour into a tulip still resulted in loads and loads of fizzy, beige colored head with some decent lacing. This is a very active beer in the glass. After 5 minutes, the head is still almost an inch thick and continues to be actively reinforced by the carbonation from below. Color is dark cola brown with a nice reddish tinge. Aroma is malty and sweet with a hint of alcohol.

Taste has a wonderful balance of sweet malts but with a nice dry finish. There's a complexity to this that I just can't place, but whatever those tastes are, they're working very well together. For me, the feel really shines. Medium+ bodied, plenty of carbonation but not overdone, and smooth in a way that really hides the alcohol. Very well done beer.",4.31
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,Apparently I was so faded I forgot to review or even rate this somehow. Super late for any kind of real review but I really liked this one. Idk if I was a hater towards the OG or of I liked this one that much more but I probably need to revist the OG. I do distinctly remember this being fire though,4.3
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Poured black and viscous - topped with an impressive (considering the ABV) brown head that reached a good 2 inches over the liquid. The lacing was just as impressive; it remained in the glass long after I finished.
The aroma, while mild to my chemically damaged nose (Invest in a decent respirator people!) still got through some dark fruits (plums, raisins) and bourbon. Hmm, smells pretty good.
Taste followed, along with some coffee; both in the warmth of the initial sip and the bitterness of an overly roasted bean. Interesting!
The feel was also very good; viscous enough for the ABV but not chewy- just nice, smooth sipping.
OA, this is a very good BA stout, and I'm a bit perplexed by it's sub top 100 in stouts ranking, but I suspect that means I just need to try more stouts.
Also, in my opinion alone, I believe the non BA version to taste a little better. I have to have them side by side to verify.",4.28
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Pours out like used motor oil; pitch black, capped with a creamy light brown head. Great retention and lacing that belies its abv. Like chocolate syrup with a toasted marshmallow on top.

I'm not picking up much aroma this time. Maybe it's too cold? I get molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, and bourbon for sure, though.

The flavor is dominated by rich dark chocolate, baking cocoa powder, espresso, bourbon, some butterscotch and caramel sweetness, tobacco, vanilla, oak, leather, and a hint of smoke. Coffee and earthy bitterness lingers, tamed by hints of bourbon sweetness.

The mouthfeel is thick, rich, oily, and fudgy. Ample carbonation prevents it from being too sludgy.

This is a wonderful BBA stout. Rich in flavor, doesn't detract from the flawless base beer.",4.35
Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"As an erstwhile Colorado native I proclaim this to be an excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. Personally I like the regular Ten Fiddy better, which I admit is strange. But that said, Oskar Blues did a fantastic job finding the right blend of bourbon barrels to impart a variety of interesting, well balanced nuances to the base stout. The oak and vanilla from the barrels are prominent but not overwhelming. There is a nice, burnt, candied sugar flavor, then the undertones of espresso and chocolate malts. Really quite fantastic overall.",4.21

Ten FIDY - Bourbon Barrel Aged,"Appearance: Black as you can get. Brown colored head that quickly settled into a thin ring.

Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with purple undertones. The beer has a modest sized dark beige head, that also has some purple undertones which faded fairly quickly to a nice ring. Nice looking Imperial Stout and the purple undertones are a nice touch..

Smell: Prominent raspberries, moderate Bourbon aromas and brown sugar aromas, and mild roasted malts/coffee aromas. The beer has a good nose featuring the raspberries.

Taste: The palate features raspberries, moderate bourbon notes, modest chocolate and roasted malt notes. The taste profile is nicely balanced and while the raspberries are very apparent all the flavor elements work well together. The beer starts off fairly sweet but dries up a bit. The beer has a mild alcohol presence for the listed 14.56% ABV.

Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation that results in a nice mouthfeel for this beer.

Dragonsaddle,"Canned on 9/30/20; consumed on 10/18/20

Pours a turbid mango-gold body topped with a rounded, fluffy two and a half fingers of white foam; excellent head retention leaves a mound of cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a moderate spread of soapy, spotty lacing around the walls of the glass.

Aroma shows traces of resin as it opens, withholding overripe peach, papaya, hints of bready malt, and guava briefly as the bouquet develops; creamier tones of mango build, further accentuating guava, tangerine zest, and slight suggestions of peach and pink grapefruit over time; a lush, tropical bouquet with defined, hoppy edges.

Taste offers lime sherbet upfront, a semi-tart introduction to what is eventually a touch piney over the mid-palate and effectively accented with peppery, pithy citrus zest; pineapple, bay leaf, and apricot zest show depth into the back end as overripe mango and sweet bready malts shine into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a medium body alongside a mild carbonation deferring to a significant creamy texture dominant into the mid-palate, where a prickly resin into the back end glides toward an increasingly slick, stiff, yet easy finish.

A great entry into the NETIPA category, perpetuating in equal parts the tempered abrasion matched by the burly profile which can be found in this (sub-) style; a pointed alcohol presence, abundance of flavor, and creamy, weighted texture to tie it all together; spectacularly consumable 11.5% ABV.",4.15
Kentuckley,"2022 on tap. Weller barrels. Dark brown color, nearing black.

Big fan here.",4.39

Immense dark malt sweetness greets the palate; milk chocolate; coffee and caffeine; bourbon tones bleed midway through the malt sweetness and linger through the finish. Heavy body; dense, sticky residual sugars; huge alcohol warmth permeates through the density.

Kentuckley,"Brief Review:

O: First Transient review for me I believe. Never really got into these guys as I'm more old school. But they're really making a name for themselves with the -uckley series with 2 of them in the Top 250 now. Most recent 2021 edition here, haven't seen 2022's yet. This one comes a bit hot for me. Little boozy and tingly on the tongue. Aroma is a little suppressed. Reminds me a bit of Vanilla Noir from Prairie if it had some maple syrup in it. Otherwise the pour and mouthfeel are nice and slick, which is impressive. It's a darn good beer, not gonna lie, but maybe not world-class for me right now.

Recommendation: Decent offering from Transient here. They make a ton of BA stuff with lots of variants, so hard to get anything to stand out.",4.26
Kentuckley,"A beer that is somehow powerful yet subtle at the same time. Mild dark tan lacing. Scents of coffee, vanilla, and bourbon, mild maple syrup notes.

Schaarbeekse Kriek,"2022-07-16
750ml corked/caged bottle served in a tulip. Bottling date 08/26/2020. Bought it earlier today at Chuck's Hop Shop Seward Park. It was expensive.

Pours a dark purplish red with a small to nonexistent head -- a thin white ring around the glass, with sparse carbonation. Fairly hazy. Smell is rich berry jam and oaky acid tartness.

Taste is similar -- rich berry jam, more on the oak and less on the acid, almost a funk to it, and something that hints at a butteriness, not diacetyl, but something that just makes it seem fuller and richer. Moderate fruit skin bitterness characteristic.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very dry. Overall, this is a very good beer.",4.35
Schaarbeekse Kriek,"750ml brown bottle, caged and corked. Label has bottling date of '08/26/2020', with best before date of '10/26/2040'.

Notes on label: ""For this Schaarbeekse Kriek, we macerated locally grown and manually harvested sour cherries for almost fourteen months in wooden barrels, with both one-year and two-year old lambik. The final fruit intensity is about 318 grams of Schaarbeekse per litre of finished Schaarbeekse Kriek. The average age of this beer upon release will be at least two-and-a-half years.""

Clear, cherry red colored body. Fizzy head quickly disappeared. No lacing.
Aroma is cherry, funk and oak. Funk is more leather and tobacco like. Indications of sourness but the oak gives off an old wood fibe.
Taste is quite sour, each sip leaves the mouth dry. There is a sour cherry flavor that still gives off a brief hint of fruit sweetness. At this time the funk flavor is showing less than what is in the nose, but remains in the leather and tobacco expression. Has quite a bit of oak tannins, especially on the exhale of the breath and in the released air from the stomach.
Medium mouth feel. Good carbonation.
Very good fruited lambic, although could likely increase more complexity and funk expression with bottle aging.",4.3

Red Eye November,"2021 release. Bottle to tumbler.

Look: Jet black with with lots of tiny floaters looking like golden stardust. No head. No lacing.

Smell: Malty, sweet and boozy. Clear notes of rye, molasses and coffee.

Taste: The rye is very present with the molasses adding sweetness, the coffee bitterness. Dark chocolate is there, malty and woody hints as well. The boozy barrel notes keep everything together very nicely.

Feel: Full and thick. Rather creamy than syrupy. Very low carbonation.

Overall: At first, the combination of rye, molasses and coffee didn't sound too promising to me as I'm not a big fan of any of the three flavors in my stouts. However, in this case every single one of them adds to a perfectly balanced taste which, together with the creamy mouthfeel, results in a fantastic beer.",4.74
Red Eye November,"2021 release - batch 5. 13.3% ABV. Poured from a 500mL bottle into a snifter.

Clear (?) seal brown liquid with a faint tan collar. Vague sheen of tears; no head development.

Rich, balanced aromas of coffee, roast malt, chocolate covered cherries, faint pipe tobacco, and molasses; perhaps an earthy hop note at times.

Unctuous palate entry suffused with all the flavors from the nose, dialed up. Bittersweet chocolate, bright stone fruit/berry notes, leading to layers of cocoa, loam, treacle, and toasted brown sugar. Malt exhibits moderate roast qualities, but more forward character comes from the coffee and barrel. No char. Low bitterness. Medium-dry finish. Decent complexity, but more focus on balance and smoothness I think.

Oily, rich, medium-full body with dangerously disguised alcohol.

Excellent example of the style, although, perhaps, the base beer is a touch subdued. Maybe not the best value, but I won't dock any points for that...",4.41
Red Eye November,"Midnight black oily pour with a brown head. The nose is essentially a perfect ba coffee stout nose, and thus elevated the overall score a bit: huge and full coffee with tones of bean and grounds plus earth, bittersweet dark chocolate, rye, dried date, plus huge rich barrel notes with an emphasis on the molasses and vanillin laiden bourbon, wow. Taste has brighter complexion with semi-sweet chocolate, raisin, and barrel is not as powerful, loses the rye and some earth tones, but still excellent. Feel is chewy yet medium bodied, good barrel with the warmth in particular, but coffee is the clear star with roast and percolation for days.

Flora,"A: Retention becomes an accelerated rupture shortly after the discharge, which emanates a willowy throw-over. Nonetheless, the preceding kick-off presents a spumescent elegance, as the stretch reaches to inches ahead of that ensuing regression.

Just below is a presentation on appearance that succumbs the Golden Shield Lichen, with a Tuscan sun appeal.

The scents carry on towards cameo apples besides the pear drop to honey bananas, while pink & white grapefruit alloy the baboon lemon kind of limes. There’s a touch of grainy malt, for the cracker-y moments, which respect the advancing yeast properties to umbrella remote spices. In the interim, a distant dank earthiness, for fresh hay and cut pastures, while pulling a dragged mustiness out from barnyard phenols. The aerated openness channels oak to the finer points inside dry/calibrated wine, as a background frowzy lays horse blankets atop cellar moths. The forward march is neatly acidic, while continuing to press earthy must on fading rose petals, before the dry & brittle antiques of wooden leather

T: A mineralogy reading, for foretaste to indulge, with the accompanying fruit + spices relating to the harvested derives. Inferences campaign on earthy farmsteads with feedlot jazz and cultivated tobacco, as a tempered acidity roots crimson red rhubarbs. On balance, a light malt baking to field hops with a toasted spiciness, while yeast properties grind along a rural bitterness. Accordingly, grassy provinces with situated granaries that stow garnered wheat. The vintage addresses contextual funk, and pushes agricultural sulfates thru river rock mulch, as fungus builds upon the air-dry acclimations. There’s a developing cue of Grüner Veltliner, by the elongated pour for grape tinges, and a furtherance for cellar natures. To that end, a docility on acidity, as notations add oddity for woodlot ecology and slurry manure, afore dry skin briefcases

M: A bright, light buoyancy with antiquated funk, and sharp vibrancy. The allotted span comes with arbitrated tartness, which is moderated throughout, as a compliment to the progressed barrenness. Thus, a thrilling attenuation that styles effervescence handily, as the timed exposure madcaps the resounding involvedness from side to side upon the clean-complete finish

O: An environmental showcase that harvests funk habitually, with a touch of wheat malt in back to weigh hop efficiency. The moment of service is a period of effectiveness, given the dry bite for the webbed yeast densities and age aligning land-locks",4.46
Flora,I had the 2016 version which is a blend of Florence age for 18 months in a selection of wine barrels whose providence includes art and civil disobedience number 10. Very good beer.,4.5
Flora,"Bottle: Poured a pale yellow color ale with a large foamy head. Aroma of funky Brett notes with some tartness, oak and light acidity notes also perceptible. Taste is a mix of funky Brett notes, oak, tart notes with subtle acidic notes. Body is about average with good carbonation. Interesting saison with right amount of complexity.",4.23
Coolship Red,"This is likely spot-on for style, but a bit too much pucker for me. Pours a beautiful berry-red with a quick-fading cap of white. Aroma is heavenly raspberry and very mild funk. Flavors are delicious as well, with tons of berry dominating. Very tart. So tart. But, I don't review so much for style attributes, but whether I enjoy. This one took me 2 sittings.",4.3
Coolship Red,"Thanks to Roy_Hobbs for this one, as part of the beatings he delivered during NBS BIF #15. 12.7oz Cork and Caged bottle (Packaged Dec 3 2020) poured into 14oz teku. Poured a lovely dark red color with about 1/8 inch of pink head that quickly dissipated and left no lacing.

The aroma was solidly full of raspberry, with just a light bit of grain in the background.

On the tongue, a big hit of bitterness punches the front of the palate, with raspberry dominating the rest.

The body was light, crisp, had decent carb, and a very dry finish.

Drinkability was very good, I'd like to have regular access to this.

Overall, a very good beer. A must-try if you see it.",3.95
Coolship Red,"375ml bottle from 2012.

Pours dark copper with a burgundy tinge. Quickly fizzling head with zero retention or lacing. Fairly evident raspberries in the nose with faint cider vinegar and diaper.

Tart raspberry, oak, light funk, and vinous quality in the nose. Awesome tart raspberry flavor, bright, rich fruit with bracing acidity. Light body, bright entry, medium acid, all in a dry, tart fruit-filled finish. Outstanding.",4.24
Coolship Red,"Pours a vibrant red with low pink head.

Smell is tart and vinous with notes of fresh raspberries, raspberry jam, lime, oak and bit of funk.

Taste is phenomenal. Tart with tons of fresh raspberries and a bit of jam. Dry and vinous with notes of peach, oak, funk and a bit of bitterness. Nice acidity and tremendous balance.

Mouthfeel is medium and dry with effervescent carbonation.

Overall, a stunning beer. I am a huge fan for raspberries in beer, and this is close to the daddy, Cantillon's Rose de Gambrinus.",4.7
Coolship Red,Ruby red color somewhat translucent. Licorice and raspberry on the nose. Candied raspberry tart taste with some very yeast notes. Really pops in the mouth; crisp. Lots of flavors here. Solid beer.,4.59
Coolship Red,"Very interesting and complex ale. First, this is definitely a sour. I usually do not like sours but this is definitely one I will keep drinking. The nose is a very light raspberry with a hint of yeast or fruit wine influence. It is a beautiful deep red color. The taste definitely has a fruit wine influence with a subtle bubbly or spicy finish. Overall a fantastic well made beer, especially if you enjoy raspberries.",4.5
Coolship Red,"Appearance - The beer was pinkish red is color with white bubble clinging to the sides of the glass.

Smell -,The nose brought to mind vinegary red berries.

Taste - There was a lot of raspberry in the taste, but I also detected some tart cherries. It was surrounded by a vinegary presence. The profile was tart, but did not remove tooth enamel. Sourness was lessened by a dry finish.

Mouthfeel - The carbonation was fairly intense, allowing for a dry finish.

Overall - This was a fine, well balanced sour.",4.49
Coolship Red,"Look: beautiful, opaque garnet red. Soft white head evaporates quickly; no lace. Ring of tiny bubbles along the glass.

Smell: subtle sour raspberries. Some funk. All gorgeous.

Taste: sharp, tangy, sour raspberry with some funk and vinegar. Beautiful rich fruit with sharp notes taking it up and up.

Feel: Lots of sharp, active, elevating tiny bubbles. Sharp on the tongue in the best possible way.

This is a magnificent beer. All angles, sharpness, acid, funk, and fruit. And bubbles. It's alive...",4.5

Very tart , fizzy sudsing , tart bone dry finish

Good beer",4.24
Coolship Red,I want more funk. The raspberry character is big but the beer lacks depth. Would love to get some musty barnyard or brett character to provide some dimension. Wouldn't buy again.,3.46
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Pours pitch black with a finger of dark mocha head. Aroma and taste giving off loads of roasted malt, peat, coffee grounds, dark chocolate, black cherry, prune, caramel, molasses, tobacco, drying oak tannin, significant bourbon, nice amount of vanilla. Low full body. Oily, sticky, silky. A gigantic beer that doesn't disappoint. Well done as expected.",4.43
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottle, package date of 11/17/21. Pours black with a very small sized brown head. Smells of bourbon, cocoa, vanilla, dark fruit, dark roasted malt, and earthy hops. The taste follows exactly. Good intensity and balanced flavors. Moderate bitterness and dryness in the finish. Above average body and low carbonation. Overall this is a great barrel aged RIS; strong yet smooth and drinkable.",4.52
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Many thanks to Erland for sharing this one. Pkgd 11/17/21. 13.4% ABV, 12oz bottle.
Pours out to a syrupy thick ink black, forming a thick dark cocoa head with average retention, sparse lacing. The nose is definitely full of bourbon but on top of that classic expedition nose we all love...prunes, dark chocolate, raisins, figs, soy sauce and black walnut. Mouthfeel is smooth and syrupy, dense bodied. Medium light carbonation, ~2.25 carbs or so. Taste is a recap of the nose. The bourbon is well balanced with the other complex stuff going on here and gives it a more warming presence that traditional Expedition. Bitterness is mild and earthy, hops are kept in check by copious malts. Considering the rich complex malts, there is no sourness or astringency here...this easily happens in lesser RIS's if the roasted malts are overdone. One is enough. It's a heavy hitter and very rich. This might be great over dark chocolate ice cream. Hrmmm. Might have to try that.",4.38
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,Black in color with no light penetration. There's a fingernail of brown around the rim. The aroma is of piney hops and dark malt. I'm tasting piney hops and sweet bourbon. The mouth is thick and chewy.,4.27

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,I have to say I liked this one much better once it warmed up. Before it warmed up it there was a big chocolate taste with some barrel. After it warmed the other flavors started to pop. The chocolate faded a bit and vanilla and coffee flavors became more present. The barrel also came to the forefront. A bit thin but very good overall.,4.33
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"12oz bottled 11/17/2021 poured into a snifter at 47° Fahrenheit 13.4% ABV. The beer pours pitch black with zero light penetration and minimal light brown head. The head recedes to an irregular ring and leaves a few tiny spots of lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla and coffee. The taste is bittersweet roasted malt with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, deeply charred oak barrel, bourbon, coffee and chocolate fudge. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with just less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. No alcohol presence in the aroma or taste, which is incredible for the ABV. Overall, excellent to world class. The balance is key. All the tastes are wonderfully integrated.",4.6

12oz bottle served in a pair of Georgetown sample glasses. Packaged 10/16/18. Received from @Whyteboar in a LIF associated with BIF #14.

Pours black, brown along the edges, with essentially no head. Smell is boozy, bourbon, vanilla, oak, and very dark chocolate / dark roasted coffee.

Taste is boozy and super anise-y. Lots of roasty bitterness, lots of boozy sweetness. Fairly soft and well-balanced, actually.

Mouthfeel is thick and fluffy. Overall, very nice.",4.18
Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"2018 Vintage
12oz bottle poured into a tulip

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy dark khaki head that reduces to a thin ring around the glass

S- huge barrel aromas on the nose; spicy oak, barrel juice, caramel and vanilla. Bold aromas of chocolate brownie batter, dark chocolate, molasses, mocha cream, anise, charred malt, figs & raisins. Just a hint of underlying piney hops and booze

T- bold barrel notes lead the way with strong barrel juice, peppery oak and complimenting notes of caramel and vanilla. Mid-palate brings out notes of brownie batter, chocolate fudge, herbal coffee, charred malt, black licorice and figs. The finish gives more bold barrel juice and a hint of piney hops. Lingers of bourbon and brownie batter

M- heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a thick and creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety warming finish

Expedition Stout - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,"Vintage 2020/5/18
This officially serves to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that not *everything* from 2020 was a dumpster fire.
Appearance is amazing, maybe because I was so ready for a beer, but few beers have looked better. Black with dark brown highlights and a thin brown head.
The aroma was malts and plums and raisins and more malts. The taste. I literally said “wow” - (I was so ready for this) just so smooth without sharp edges typically found in RISs, maybe the bourbon, maybe the aging, can’t say, but wow.
The feel, obviously IMO, but it struck me as ideal for the genre. Viscous but not too much. And I mentioned smoothness earlier, oh yes.
So glad they are in Michigan. Thanks Larry for this.",4.79
90 Minute IPA,"Appearance: Pours a rich, golden reddish amber color, with a thick white foam head. Good retention and leaves behind some sticky lacing.

Aroma: Sweet bready malt and pine. A subtle touch of citric fruit.

Taste. A pronounced maltiness followed by hoppy layers of citrus and pine. Some bready biscuit notes. Malt backbone and a bitterness that starts half-way through, and rides all the way to the end. Finishes fairly clean.

Overall: This is one interesting, well balanced beer.",3.9
90 Minute IPA,"First review here goes.
Glassware used - Lagunitas pint glass
Appearance- pours an amber color with a 1 finger foam head.

Smells sweetly like of caramel and apples.

Taste- taste of malt and breadiness fades Into a minimally bitter finish.",4.35
90 Minute IPA,"Something they did with the hops and the malt... the BITTER is SWEET. Like, simultaneously. They are one.
Poured from can into my lucky pint glass and paired with cooked-from-frozen orange chicken.
Amber colored with 3-finger, long-lived foamy off-white head. Smells lemony-piney, reminds me of Murphy's Oil Soap... that's a compliment, I promise, I used to be a housekeeper. Precisely zero complaints on look, smell, or taste. I do wish the foam would cut it out a little so I wasn't getting half a mouthful of it every sip, but you can't win 'em all. It is very pretty, at least. Top notch IPA.",4.73
90 Minute IPA,"So bitter! Also, the color looks off and the bubbles are too small. I understand this is highly rated but it is not to my liking. Beer buyer beware!",2.6
90 Minute IPA,"Look: Rich amber-red with a formidable eggshell head that erupts on the pour and holds as a pillow, slowly receding and leaving great lacing behind
Aroma: Pine needles and sap, grapefruit, fir needles, orange, raw hop cones, and some bready malt
Taste: Starts out with layers of pine and hop cones that pile on one another for prominence and followed by nice notes of freshly baked bread. Citrus fruits peek in once the conifer barrage settles down and mixes in before pine and fir return for the close
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, and a decently dry finish with zero hint of the ABV
Overall: This is good stuff and a classic. One of the first DIPA’s I had 15+ years ago and cool that they still make it and in stovepipe cans to boot. C-hops are prominent and the strong malt presence showcases this as an old-school DIPA, which I like. Tasty and fun to try again after many years",4.17
90 Minute IPA,"Poured out as a copperish color with a foamy head that slowly subsides.
The smell is of malt plus a nice hoppy aroma.
The taste is that of malt, hops, and what you expect from an IPA - Imperial.
Definitely one that I will be getting again.",4.71
90 Minute IPA,"12 oz bottle from a 6 pack. Right fine IPA. Balanced bitter & malt. It’s got the look, the pungent aroma that non-IPA people hate, a nice long finish. Recycle. Repeat.",4.23
90 Minute IPA,"Looks and smells good. What matters most is taste and this is not a light weight, which it isn't supposed to be. Heavy on the malt would be only criticism. Almost prefer the 60 minute if only because I can drink two in succession and save some calories, which you can do with this 90, however two of these and that ends the session for me.",4.35
90 Minute IPA,"Large format 19oz. can with NOV 2022 stamped on the bottom.
This pours a beautiful, medium orange-amber color, gloriously clear with a tall head of off-white that peppered the glass with lace.
The aroma is less than I remember - more citrus than 20 years ago and less malt sweetness in the nose. Some caramel and grain notes are there but not the blast of scents this had when produced, in smaller, more lovingly made batches.
As it warms and I swirl, more floral hops come forward as well as some more grainy wort.
Flavor is much better than expected - not as rich and malty as I recall but firm in it's malt character if a bit less balanced.
Hop flavors from mid/constant boil seem less, this that when it first came out defined the term ""juicy"" for beer.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin but just fine for style and maybe the only improvement over the first few years when it was a bit on the heavy side.
Finish is mildly and pleasantly alcoholic complimented by lingering grassy hop flavors and bitterness.
This still has good balance and hop flavor w/out sacrificing malt character. Not bad for a big batch beer.
A previous reviewer said "" Old school goodness"". I couldn't agree more.",4.26
90 Minute IPA,"Amber, with good clarity. Head pours moderately thick (about a finger), and is an off-white eggshell color. Fade to a persistent cap with little lacing.

Aroma is initially malt. Thick, sugary barley. Floral hops, sweet pine, lime peel, then toffee. Going back in, I get grapefruit, pineapple, and mandarin oranges.

On the palate, it's thick, sweet malt. Toffee, caramel, sugar, dried fruit, and candied orange peel. Sweet piney resin. Lasting bitterness. This is about as close as you get to a barleywine without crossing over.

The taste and aroma continue to evolve as it warms. The malt becomes more prominent, but it always finishes with a pleasant piney bitterness. Overall, this is a delicious beer that is right up my alley. I love that orange hop flavor coupled with thick barley malt.",4.51
90 Minute IPA,"Clear orange amber brew is quite handsome in the tall goblet with abundant foam. Hugely hoppy and quite bitter, but not too unpleasant. Interesting dark roasted malty taste. Grapefruit and piney hops.

Distinctive woody taste. Just the thing to hop up some Blonde Ale I am stuck with. From the 19.325 oz can. A massive amount of this strong beer for a few bucks at a nondescript southern California liquor store. Dated AUG 2022, hopefully a ""drink by"" date.",3.58

90 Minute IPA,"12oz can best by date June 2022 into a pint glass.
L: Pours almost crystal clear amber w/a 1"" pock marked creamy off white head w/decent retention to a creamy skin. Random lacing and some sticky sheeting.
S: Caramelized malts, grassy hops, orange zest, a hint of bread. It is pungent, fruity & floral.
T: Citrus zest, black tea, caramelized roasty malts, grapefruit, fruit cake, grassy hops, lemon drop candy, a suggestion of brown bread, moderate alcohol. It is somewhat tart w/pine resin in a med-long linger. Powerful malts, bold hops and is full flavored.
F: Sharp, firm & smooth med-heavy bodied mouth feel that is lightly sticky and almost thick. It has a rather drying finish.
O: A full flavored American Imperial IPA that truly delivers an enthusiastic and unrestrained dense punch of malts & hops. It's taste is BIG and it is excellent in it's style.",4.29
90 Minute IPA,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Dogfish Head IP Glass. Two finger off-white head. Pours golden and hazy. Decent lacing.

S - Bitter citrus and floral IPA scent

T - Taste is more complex than scent. Has some maltiness to balance the bitter floral and citrus. Very balanced for an IPA. Each taste goes back and forth between malt and hop.

F - Nice medium oily feel.

O - Top notch IPA. Drank the same night as 60 Min IPA. Both are wonderful beers that are definitely in my annual rotation. The 60 Minute is the IPA standard for me. This 90 Minute is a great premium version with more complexity.",4.41
90 Minute IPA,"Best by Jul 2022. Drinking feb 24 2022. Room temperature.

L: amber body, off white 2 finger head that becomes a ring. Good lacing.

S: mostly tropical fruit, some pine, a hint of malt.

T: a nice piney bitterness, grapefruit tartness, a touch of sweetness, and a bittersweet hoppy roasted malt finish.

F: a full viscous body, similar to a good barrel aged stout. Creamy and coats the tongue. Beautiful execution for a dipa.

O: an above average ipa in every aspect. The mouth feel was my favorite part, but there were no major weaknesses. Definitely a better ipa for malt centric beer lovers. Probably better options out there if you like pine sol flavored beer.",4.35
Two Hearted Ale,"One of our Michigan beers, this is a staple, every party store and gas station has it, I like IPAs, this is bitter, I like that, it stays on the tongue, I like that.....
If you like this, try Huma Lupa Licius by Shorts.",4.68
Two Hearted Ale,"American IPAs are rarely my first pick, but I think it's because I find myself wishing that every other American IPA was this one.
Gorgeous hazy amber color, and foams and laces beautifully- it's a very good looking beer. If it were a person I'd buy it a pint of itself. Smells piney. Actually drinking it does not disappoint. Flavor's got layers- good hops, pleasant little grapefruit and pine notes, all backed up by good malt. As for mouthfeel, it's good. I almost wish it was a little less carbonated, but would never suggest messing with the delicate balance of a beer so close to perfect. I'm a big fan.",4.54
Two Hearted Ale,"Look is dark orange/amber, smell is of candied orange, hop resin, slight pine. Taste is more of the candied orange and hop bitterness. Really solid IPA, definitely a unique taste on this one in regards to the soft orange taste, very west coast IPA.",4.17
Two Hearted Ale,"Pint can poured into a DuClaw Brewing pint glass at fridge temp.
Amber/gold color, slight haze, fantastic foam.
Using a distinct single hop (Centennial), Two Hearted Ale has a delicate orange blossom citrus aroma, assertive but well-balanced bitterness, and a lovely supporting crystal malt base.
Great everyday beer.
Goes well with anything.",4.3
Two Hearted Ale,"Age: 4 months from packaging.

Look: A Touch hazy, not crystal clear. Amber in color and beautiful head of lacey foam.

Smell: Malty hops. Pleasant.

Taste: The surprising malty background blew me away. I love a good malt but to see it shine in a IPA was kind of nuts. I enjoy the taste. The malt and hops are balanced well.

Feel: The lingering malt feel on the tongue is pleasent. There is not a bitter bite to it like you would expect, its there but not enough that you couldn't session this beauty.

Overall: I love it really. Its going in my rotation. What Ive found is that after some hazy beer, double IPA, etc, throwing this malty IPA in the mix just completes the circle. Its great. Thanks Bell's.",5.0
Two Hearted Ale,"Pours a hazy, deep yellow with very good carbonation and a light, airy head. Aroma is citrus and pine, with perhaps a very slight hint of grapefruit. Taste is light, largely bright, perfectly balanced between bitter and refreshing. The citrus comes through strongly, followed by pine.",3.34
Two Hearted Ale,"I’ll start by saying that I am NOT an IPA guy. I’ve tried a few but just cannot appreciate whatever is going on with that. However, I heard the hype on this and wanted to give it a short. My initial smell is heavy of pine and citrus with just a hint of malt. The flavor is the same. I get a pleasant pine taste and it reminds me of a chilly fall morning sitting in a tree stand waiting for a buck to walk by. The finish has a mild malt flavor and a medium dry finish. It’s not too bad and the only IPA I’ve been able to stomach. I bought a 6pack just for my own edification, in hopes of understanding the genre better.",3.59
Two Hearted Ale,"L: Hazy golden nectar with a small white head that dissipates into a film and a ring around the glass.
S: Yeast rolls, caramel, citrus fruit, pine resin, all the hallmarks of the best American IPAs.
T: Same as smell, but way more intense, as the bitterness is incredibly pronounced, as it should be with an IPA. Pine resin is popping out here.
F: Carbonation on the high side, but between that and the bitterness, the alcohol is very well masked. Medium heavy body.
O: Fantastic old-school IPA that isn't overly fruity or sweet. Highly recommend to everyone who wants a world-class IPA with no BS.",4.9
Two Hearted Ale,"Yummmm. this is a great IPA. The favors include an initial earthy taste, finished with grapefruit zest. I like this beer very much. I first had it in the Ann Arbor. So glad they sell is locally in MA. Even after 20 minutes, the taste and look remain.",4.58
Sculpin,"Got this on draft.

Pours a clear golden color with a small head and moderate lacing.

Smells and tastes of malt and and peppery hops with some tart citrus.

Medium body and carbonation. Dry mouthfeel.

This is a classic west coast IPA",4.35
Sculpin,"Just a bit of haze infiltrating the amber body along with a medium size white head and good lacing. After inhaling everything hoppy, from citrus to pine and everything in between, there wasn't much room for the malts to make a statement. Thought they might take a step forward in the taste, but nyet, still awash in all the hop pleasures. Bold and bitter right thru to the aftertaste. Full-to-bodied well carbonated mouthfeel that is so welcome after weeks of malty marzens and festbiers. Could easily pass for a DIPA.",4.41
Sculpin,"12oz bottles and on tap into a 16oz nonic pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly cloudy caramel amber with a 1.5"" off-white rocky head with very good retention. It is well carbonated right to the end of the pint. Some skeletal lacing and banding.
S: Apricot, peach, light pineapple, pine, raisins, light sweet bread.
T: Earthy apricot, sweet ripe tangerine, lemon peel, mango, juicy pine and toasted grains. It is fairly bitter with pine resin lingering throughout the finish and is moderately sweet and resinous.
F: It has a firm, lightly sticky medium-bodied mouthfeel that is smooth with a long finish. It is not jarring with hops yet they are bold and balanced.
O: I first tried this beer in 2008. A bottle pour produces a bit more foam than does a tap pour. It is an excellent full flavored hop-forward West Coast IPA. It's well balanced hop configuration flavors remind me of the children's breakfast cereal ""Fruit Loops"". It is very excellent in it's style.",4.44
Sculpin,"Canned 1/25/21

This is one of those beers that I had for the first time very early on in my craft journey but never reviewed. From what I remember of my 21st, I had a lot of this and the grapefruit variant, and kinda just stopped going back to them after that. Not for any particular reason, but I started branching out since I had the options. So when I saw this and the grapefruit one lying around recently, I just had to pick them up, even though they were older cans they deserve a proper review

Pours a lightly cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

Despite the age on the can, this is still in your face hoppy and fresh, which is really what drew me to this beer more than anything when I first had it. I'm picking up on aromas of earthy hops, pithy grapefruit, coriander, lemon rind, biscuity malt, and light caramel

As I said, I recall the aroma being the high point, and the taste lagging a bit behind, but in this case I think it's the age showing a bit. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting pine sap, bready malt, white pepper, pithy grapefruit, and peach. The swallow brings notes of orange zest, peppery hops, caramel malt, and toasted grain

A light medium body pairs with mild carbonation, resulting in a slick yet firm beer. Finishes off dry and feels much lighter than the 7% it actually is

This beer is an institution for a reason. An absolute classic which holds up today, but I can only imagine what it was like for people to experience this one in the early days. A treasure of a beer that I think I'll have to come back to more often",4.24
Sculpin,"This beer, is top tier IPA. It is very bitter, but with character and makes this one of a kind. Meant To wow all those who are tired of the same hazies, same ol imperials, whatever. This beer is unique. Look is obviously excellent, bright and opaque. As for feel, well it goes down with ease, with the feel of a superior beer. Carbonation, nuetrality, and taste that's what you need. If warm, it may not feel so great, due to it's strong flavor.

This beer is worth more than market. It really should be priced a bit more than it's competition, but it's not. So it's a great deal to boot.

Now, the alcohol. This beer hits you. It is totally reliable to make you extra drunk and fast. Be wary and believe me and my fellow Sculpin lovers. This is also added value. Ballast Point will go down in history for this legendary beer. My only complaint may be consistency. It's very strong IPA, so a bit more likely to get an off-batch once in a blue moon",4.89

Medium mouth feel. Excellent carbonation.
This was a major star when the bitter West Coast IPA was in vogue. Now more of a reminder of this IPA style, but well made and crafted.",4.31
Sculpin,"It smells like fresh fruit.  Citrussy but not specific.  It's a sweet smell mostly fruity but a little bit of maltiness too.

It's bitterness first but it's really fresh.  Then there is both citrus and pine flavored hops.  There is that little bit of malt as well.

It's thin but really foamy.  It's smooth and refreshing.  The finish starts off bittersweet but eventually is just bitter.

Overall it's delicious.  It's a refreshing fruity and bitingly bitter IPA.  I give it a 5.2 out of 6.",4.41
Hopslam Ale,"This was a New To Me beer and I was just blown away by how much I love it. Great look, smell, and taste. If you like DIPAs, you'll really like this. Enjoy!!",4.71
Hopslam Ale,"Hopslam (2022) has a very thick, off-white head and a translucent, orange appearance, with bubble streams and heavy lacing. The aroma is of white bread crust. The flavor is of strong, but not harsh, hop bitterness, white bread crust, and possible honey. Hopslam (2022) has a high-medium body and a dry finish.

Hopslam Ale,"Don’t need a lot of detail for this monster.,. it’s just totally superb across the board.
Excellence in brewing. Killer DIPA.
And I dig the Danger Factor.,. “go ahead.,. have another.,” lol.",4.49
Hopslam Ale,"L - golden with a large off-white head that sticks around leaving behind a ton of lacing. Good looking IPA
S - Tons of juicy, piney, bitter hops, tropical and citrus notes, as well as honey. Some caramel and malts as well. Floral notes as well
T - follows the nose with juicy, piney, resinous, bitter hops, tropical and citrus fruits, and honey all intermixed incredibly well. The honey really smooths out bitterness from the hops. Malt ties everything together nicely
F - medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Refreshing
O - an incredibly well balanced DIPA",4.6
Hopslam Ale,"Canned 1-20-22
Perfect, beauteous pour. Deep amber color, transparent with reasonable chill haze and a firm, persistent 1/2 inch head of creamy tan foam that left full curtains of lace.
Aroma is a mix of rich malt and hints of woodsy hops. Sweet, caramel and honey nose with subtle pine and citrus hop notes are a welcoming indicator of the flavors to follow.
Rich and yummy malt flavors wrap around the conifer and leathery hop resins in terrific balance. Honey character comes through and the body leans towards a honey like texture and mouth feel. Okay, Not honey thick but your do feel the beer hug your tongue, leaving a slick, sweet coating allowing that depth of flavor to linger.... honey-like.
Hop bitterness comes in at the finish with a long and smoldering hop/pepper burn as the honey-malt dance twirls off stage.
Alcohol is always perceptible but never gets in the way or in any way harsh.
Expertly crafted, no un-needed wheat or oat starch, no unseemly and superfluous floculants, just a straight up damn good BIG beer.
Outstanding.",4.47
Hopslam Ale,"It smells really floral, citrussy and sweet. There's a subtly about the scents. Definitely the sweetness is from both the malts and honey. The citrussy floral notes are obviously from the slamming hops.

Sweetness is the first taste that occurs as it hits the palet but then really nice hoppy bitterness.

It's thin and has medium foamy carbonation. The finish is bitter, floral and sweet initially incredibly balanced but everything else fades and the bitterness remains drawing out for some time.

Overall it's such an extremely good DIPA. The hops are very strong but the sweetness of the malts and honey balance it out so instead of being extreme it's incredibly refreshing. One of my favorite DIPAs, it has an originality to it. I give it a 5.7 out of 6.",4.75
Hopslam Ale,"look: deep yellow, white head,

smell: very nice, floral and plum smell

taste: honey and floral and grapefruit peel, very punchy

overall: awesome beer, it's similar to triple sunshine and zombie dust, in my opinion",4.39
Hopslam Ale,"nice off white head but I expected it to be longer lasting for beer rated this highly. nice lacing. Less smell than I expected, but it just oozes ""complexity"". Less hop bitterness than I expected/more malty than I expected. .Medium to heavy body mouthfeel; very smooth, merest hint of the honey. Overall, not a lick of indication that it is 10% ABV. A very nice double IPA but not entirely sure it is at or anywhere near the top of my cost v. quality list for IPAs.",4.37
Hopslam Ale,"Decided to delete my old review so that this one shows as new ... copied the original text below for reference. Best beer I've had this year, don't know what's changed but been thru an entire case now ... amazing. Not Heady Topper, but I recommend drink from the can, or pour into a big glass and enjoy the ride. Looks good, smells fresh but the taste is the wow factor, Extremely hopped, with a great bitterness, drinkable, and 2 16's is completely satisfying, overall world class.

Edit 1/31/2021 This year's release back in bottles is very good, almost great, and I actually bought a sixer after my one single for the first time in many years. For me to spend $20 on a sixer, it has to be outstanding. Real bitterness. 4.25

Original 1/31/2020 Easily the most overrated beer on earth. And, yes, I still get one (some years even 2, a long time ago an actual sixer) every year thinking I will change my opinion. That's stupid, because I never do. Very mediocre and actually boring, even smelled a little bit like poop poured into my mason jar. Thank goodness, the aroma quickly cleared. Pretty golden color I guess. Smells decently of malt and hops, I don't detect the honey at all. Taste follows, fresh but way too mild. Overall boring as hell.",4.53

Hopslam Ale,"2/11/22 On draft at the Lincoln Fill Station.
LOOK: Very clear amber with an off white head, with good retention and better side glass lace.
SMELL: As advertised, floral and pine hops, honey, also some dark fruit.
TASTE: Citrus, not sharply bitter, smooth, malts are heavy and there is a combination of early malt and honey sweetness
in addition to the resinous hops.
Chewy, hides the 10% ABV well mildly sour in the aftertaste.

S---Floral, very floral. Sweet, like honey.

T---Grapefruit, as advertised. Finishes with the honey. Hoppy & a bit bitter. Alcohol is well hidden. On a warm day, that could be a problem.

T: For me the honey hits first, but then there's really good balance between all the different hop varieties, with a really nice bitterness to finish things out.
F: Soft and pillowy but also full-bodied and well-rounded. My favorite part about this beer.
O: An all-timer. Sits up there with Nugget Nectar as one of the highlights of a Pennsylvania winter.",4.29
Hopslam Ale,"Pours a bright copper with a full head that slowly dissipates.

A broad array of floral and pine hop notes on the nose. The honey, had I not known was there would have been too negligible to notice, but, knowing it is there, my nose picks up a smidgen.

Classically piney/grassy IPA on the tongue with a solid bitterness to finish the sip. The honey shines without adding any unwanted sweetness. Quite good.

Lightly effervescent with a full body.

This is excellent stuff. I’m thrilled to have finally tried a can and would definitely buy it in large numbers were I afforded the opportunity.",4.43
Hopslam Ale,"Not as intense as I expected. Smell is kind of muffled. The thing I like eat about it is the feel: smooth and a little syrupy going down, with some alcohol warmth after.

Old Rasputin,I got lucky. On the way home from disc golf league stopped at an cou country bumpkin gas station that has some decent beer there was a whole whole stack of this so apparently someone's drinking it I grabbed four cuz I really wanted a nice Stout a little worried it would be just too much but it's pleasant surprise not too high ABV for Russians not too sweet leaned a little hoppy cuz I think it's fresh somehow in this country bumpkin gas station store it wasn't old stuff good stout bordering on just a heavy Stout rather than a Russian this one's very well done and normally I'm afraid to go this high on the ABV but this is so heavy you don't notice it as badly there is a heavy cocoa bitter coffee hop that bounces back between those variables can't tell which one it is it keeps you guessing that's probably why it has a cult following,4.38
Old Rasputin,"Jet black appearance with an average size tan head that left good lacing. Compelling aroma of dark chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit and molasses.

Earthy, full bodied, modestly carbonated mouthfeel leading to a long lasting finish.",4.4
Old Rasputin,"Appearance: Pours A smoky jet black with a thick tan head.
Smell: Smells of coffee, dark chocolate and pumpernickel bread.
Taste: The brew blasts you with intense dark baking chocolate, with a hint of coffee and very faint sweetness. The Dark bitter chocolate dominates every other flavor.
Mouthfeel: Big and creamy.
This is a good beer,",3.8
Old Rasputin,"I am impressed with this beer in every aspect. As most stouts are, this one has all the characteristics of dark chocolate and roasted special grains with the hops sitting behind it all to mediate and balance the blend. Being that high ABV beers are tricky to brew, covering the alcohol flavor with success takes trial and error. Absolutely one of my top favorites in the stout realm along side Samuel Smiths Oatmeal Stout and Deschutes Obsidian Stout.",5.0
Old Rasputin,"Rasputin has never let me down. (knock on wood) Sometimes it is quite hoppy and other times it is more stouty and malty, but it is never disappointing. A good experience at a good price.",4.55

T- Dark chocolate flavor with a very slight
sweetness. Slightly bitter.

F- Moderately viscous mouthfeel with
very fine carbonation.

O- A fantastic Russian Imperial Stout!",4.46
Old Rasputin,"Dark chocolate colored with good head. Smells of cocoa, chocolate, malt and strong stout. Tastes of a rich stout flavored mild cocoa malt and hint of bitterness and sweetness. A very good beer strong but not overpowering. Well done and strong to the finish! Wow!",4.96
Old Rasputin,"COLOR:

Jet black, with a hefty mocha colored head that's about 2-3 fingers and lingers. This beer is as black as the inside of a coffin on a moonless night.

AROMA:

Smoked malt, molasses, figs, leather, cocoa, brown sugar, with a hint of hops.

Smells quite lovely.

BODY AND PALATE:

Tastes like it smells. Rich smoked malt that comes across as espresso and dark chocolate. A lot of the other notes show up, with a nice hops bitter note that doesn't overpower the rich bittersweetness of this stout.

In terms of mouthfeel, it's heavy mkay? Nice and creamy feeling, which is what I prefer in a stout or a porter.

FINISH:

This one coats the tongue and lingers. It develops oh so well, and lands on a curious whole wheat toast finish, which I guess I'm attributing to the malt, which is interesting and welcome. I love malty aftertastes.

CONCLUSION:

This is the gold standard of imperial stouts. It hits all of the notes, and ticks all of the boxes as to what I expect out of a nice stout. Every stout I try is compared to this, and most, unless they're milk stouts, fail to compare.

Black as sin? Check.

Rich as coffee in flavor? Check.

Thick and full bodied? Check.

Rich and complex without one note overpowering the other? Check.

Easy sipper? Oh HELL YES!!!!

Smacks you in the face with how strong it is? You betcha.

Only issue is the slight bloated feeling I get drinking imperial stouts. They're basically meals in a glass, so if you want a refreshing beer, might wanna look elsewhere. That said, this pairs really well with waffles, surprisingly.

Overall, for me, this is a 10/10 beer. It is my favorite beer of all time, and all stouts I compare to this, which I suppose now is an unfair comparison.",5.0
Old Rasputin,"L: jet black inky body, nice light head. Standard quality stout.

S: roasty, smoky, a hint of salted caramel, and ethyl. Weaker on the nose than I’d like but it’s good.

T: Follows nose. It definitely helps to open it up a bit and let it warm. Reminds me of fall without the spices.

F: a little oily but not much. Coats the tongue a little and has mild carbonation. Not perfect, but rewarding.

O: I can’t wait to revisit this once the weather starts cooling off. A quality benchmark stout to measure all stouts against. Not my favorite stout, but definitely a classic.",4.5
Old Rasputin,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for 5-10 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: dark molasses, with cola highlights. Had to pour in stages, due to the 4-finger thick, dense, dark tan head

Smell: oats, dark chocolate, malts, and dark dried fruits

Taste: intense, dark roast coffee on the front end, with some slight lightening to a bit herbaceousness in the middle. Lingering notes of unsweetened cocoa and coffee. Semi-sweet chocolate notes emerge in the middle as the beer continues to air and warm

Mouthfeel: full at the front, giving way to a syrupy smooth feel in the mouth. Good effervescence on the tongue, preventing it from becoming overwhelmingly heavy.

Overall: hot damn, this is a tantalizing beer. On look and smell alone, it gets near perfect marks. Taste was a tad bit too bitter for my palate, but it still had diverse elements to the bitterness that made it enjoyable. I can see why it's consistently ranked one of the best beers, if not the best stout",4.13

Black as can be color. The 2F cap looks like tan colored heavy cream, incredible retention. Lacing clings to the glass like glue.

Roasted malt, sugary chocolate coffee flavors.

Creamy and full bodied RIS with a hop kicking finish.

Exactly like an English brew should be, all good without going overboard.",4.29

S: dark chocolate heavy, a little more hops than I was expecting. Not the best glass, but really didn’t get that much even after the beer warmed up.

T: so much better than the smell. Loads of dark chocolate and some smoke with a nice hop bitterness. Root beer, cola, and molasses that flows into light notes of peppermint patty.

F: maybe a little thinner than some other stouts that I have had, but I prefer it that way. Coats the front snide of the mouth with a nice creamy feel. Warming",4.33
Old Rasputin,"I'm really surprised by the reviews for this one compared to my own experience. Usually BeerAdvocate doesn't steer me wrong. And this beer isn't ""wrong,"" it's just basic and underwhelming. In short, it takes like a Sam Adams with a touch of dark.

L: Very dark. Opaque black. It's a good start to a stout in that sense, but the pour looked thin to me. Not something I'm used to when serving an imperial stout. The head was a couple inches in height that took 5 minutes to start dissipating, and I can hear it fizzing out with a film of bubbles lining the glass where it once stood.

S: ""Generic beer"". I was hoping for a malty, smoky smell to align with the flavor profiles others described. I held out hope that the taste would contradict my initial experience, but...

T&F: I did a doubletake on the bottle to confirm that I had bought a stout. At this point, I was sure I must've misread the bottle when I purchased it or grabbed the wrong case off of the shelf. It's thin and lacks any unique flavor. It tastes like a dark beer. No ""smoke"" as others describe and no malty thickness I've grown accustomed to in a good, imperial stout. As previously stated, it tastes like any Sam Adams that you could grab.

O: Basic. Unremarkable. Ordinary. Not offensive, but certainly not worth seeking out or even purchasing again. And judging it as a stout, it fails in many of the characteristics you'd expect.",2.73
Old Rasputin,"my 2nd try with this popular stout... before found it a bit too hoppy-malty bitter to my liking. but now... acquiring the taste a bit.

The bottling code begins with the numerals ""11"" so i assume this is the year it was sealed? Pours an opaque raven with a bubbly cocoa head, dissipated to a mist & menacing gauntlet of bubbles on the surface. Fantastic webbing that stays put! Aroma is like a pumpernickel bread with molasses... Taste is slightly sweet, but largely dry and deeply bitter from the hops & roasted malts... something minty overhead that reminds me of a peppermint patty?... Swallow is deep, bittersweet, nice body and not too sticky, coats the tongue.

F - Just great. Light carbonation. Medium consistency

O - This is a world class IPA that sets the standard for me. The favor is so balanced. Other IPAs hit with too much of the bitter flavors that it's overpowering. This is is the IPA that I will compare future IPAs to. I definitely recommend it and will put it in my regular rotation.",4.34
60 Minute IPA,"Date on can: March, 2022

Pours a translucent, copper in color which turns gold when you hold it up to a light. A half inch of frothy foam sits on top that dissipates to a thin layer over time. Lots of lacing on the glass as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Smells chewy. Candied malts with a soapy, evergreen pine and citrus hoppiness. Taste is similar to the aroma. Lots of piney hops, a little bit of lemon/citrus and a lovely, sweet, bready maltiness in the background. Finishes bitter and a tad dry with lingering lemon and citrus rind on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of creaminess and a touch of chewiness.

This is a superbly crafted brew, at one time probably one of the best IPAs in the U.S. It remains a very solid offering with a great amount of flavor and complexity, if a bit ""old school"" tasting. A great example of a hop-forward beer that isn't overly hopped. It is balanced quite nicely with a low-key malt profile that adds ample body and just enough counteraction to the bitterness. I'm surprised I never reviewed this, as I had originally tried this well over a decade ago. It's interesting to revisit it after all this time. Cheers!",4.25

S - Pleasant pine hops and citrus zest. Very nice light flavor scents overall.

T - Taste follows scent. Sweet fruit zest paired with piney and floral hops. Very light and refreshing. There’s a nice sweet flavor that I can’t pinpoint that comes through as well. On second thought, it’s grapefruit. Very nice addition.

Pale Ale,"Sierra Nevada pale ale was introduced in 1980, this is a historic craft beers of the world that helped shape the craft beer game that we know & love. This is also one of the first beers I've ever tried and the review will be a bit biased as a result.

Look: Thin 1.5 finger - off white/ cream color head and a cloudy orange in color.

Smell: Smells wonderful - citrus, barley malt, sweet piney aroma (I wish I could make a perfume out of this fragrance).

Taste: Very refreshing - hop forward with a punch of citrus and pleasantly bitter hops, piney and grapefruit notes, mild caramel-like sweetness and crisp clean water.

Feel: So smooth - Medium soft & fluffy ale body with a mildly sweet and semi-dry finish.

Overall, it's an exceptional beer!

ABV: 5.6% | IBU: 38",4.74
Pale Ale,"Pours a deep-ish golden-orange, with a nice finger and a half, foamy white head. The head has lasting impact in my glass, lasting the entirety of the drink, well over 15 minutes. Long lines of bubbles run up the glass. Looks amazing. Thick generous lacing lines the entirety of the glass as it empties.

Smells of wheat, bread, floral hops with a touch of bitterness. It’s clean and fresh smelling. Some piney notes, notes of grassy straw. General zesty citrus in the background. It’s as clean and classic as you can get.

Some have described SNPA as a mix between an APA and an IPA, but this is just straight up APA for me with mild balancing bitterness. Gentle floral hop, grassy flavours wash over the tongue before revealing straight up sweet caramel malt, some tasty bready wheat notes, and the citrus I notice here, mostly grapefruit. Gentle but tasty. It’s so straight up clean that it almost feels more complex than it is. SNPA has never been described as the absolute boldest, biggest smash your face flavour beer, but it isn’t any worse for it. When you want that clean, crisp, yet flavourful and subtle APA, this is the taste you think of in your mind. It is your classic example personified in an actual beer.

It’s well carbonated but not super strong; resulting in a nicely smooth, mildly creamy sip. Subtle medium long finish, that leaves just a hint of bitterness and lightly roasted grains on your tongue. Finishes clean and semi-dry. It’s so easy drinking and clean I’d consider this light bodied myself.

When thinking and comparing this beer to others, I want to give it a higher ranking than I ultimately put here. There is more aspects to some beers than just the categories here. SNPA is a work-horse, a beer that can be easily drank all night, be enjoyed by quite literally every single beer drinker no matter what style preference you have, and is a super clean straight up benchmark of the style.",3.9
Stone IPA,"First actual American IPA for ages...never heard of this one before...

Amazing head...a little bubbly...intense colour.

Aroma is phenomenal...melon is dominating. But not as deep and complex as many IPA's or Belgian tripels...

Wowow...this taste is off the scale. After 2 pilsners this literally sets my soul alight. Mouth feel is like an explosion, one of the best that I have ever experienced. Sweet melon, followed by the bitter hops that literally assassinates the melon and creates a ying yang experience...

This is amazing and I totally love it. I'm buying all of the cans in the shop next to me that sells it. As soon as they open.

How could it be improved? I'm not sure...the ying yang between the melon aroma and the mega bitter aftertaste is unparelleled in my decades of beer tasting (drinking till I forget everything) ; )",4.51

Torpedo Extra IPA,"Sierra Nevada and hops go hand in hand. What began as a crazy idea scribbled in a pub eventually became our newest year-round hop bomb, Torpedo Extra IPA. The first beer to feature our “Hop Torpedo”—a revolutionary dry-hopping device that controls how much hop aroma is imparted into beer without adding additional bitterness. Torpedo Extra IPA is an aggressive yet balanced beer with massive hop aromas of citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.

Lækker potent IPA, den er kraftig, men med en god balance. Den har en aroma af pine og citrus. God fyldig øl til den mørkegyldne side",3.5
Torpedo Extra IPA,"Pours a nice dark gold to copper with an off-white finger of head that reduces to something like a bubble sea with some larger bubbles forming islands that stick around, leaving some nice lacing.
Smells of pine and citrus with a nice bready aroma hidden underneath
Taste follows the smell; quite nicely balanced hop-malt ratio... Resinous, slightly sweet, moderately bitter.
Mouth feel is medium-full; slightly above average carbonation. Alcohol is there but not overwhelming.
Overall a nice brew, but seems to be hit or miss at my location in Texas. Possibly temperature issues affecting some batches here earlier this year, but this current case dated 4//7/22 is definitely on point.",4.5
Torpedo Extra IPA,"Look: Nearly clear rich red in color with a dense and quick-forming off-white head that holds as a pillow, slowly settling and leaving behind nice lacing
Aroma: Oranges, grapefruit, pine, fresh baked bread, limes, fir needles, and the prototypical Sierra Nevada yeast phenolics
Taste: A rush of citrus fruit and rind start it off and start to mingle as layers of bready malt slowly filter in and join. Pine and fir flex some once the citrus subsides and closes with citrus rejoining the coniferous notes along with a big hop bite in tow
Mouthfeel: Full, lightly slick, medium-high carbonation, and moderate dryness on the finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic and delicious WCIPA that drinks like its name as an ‘Extra IPA’ – bigger than an IPA but not quite in full-blown DIPA territory. Lots of citrus and conifer hop notes on top of an ample malt backbone and a welcome bite and medium dry finish. I haven’t had this in a bit but will now make a point to keep it in the regular rotation",4.04

Enjoy By IPA,"Appearance:
Translucent, pastel gold. Proffers up two fingers of finely minced froth that’s white as an untouched snowcap. Modest retention gives way to sudsy, webbed lacing.

Bouquet:
A mango, pineapple, peach smoothie rife with tangy Citra and bright, tangerine-sweet Amarillo, woven together with slender strands of earthy Mosaic.

Feel:
Full-bodied and thick with hop oils, the texture is given a much needed third dimension by a boisterous, peach fuzz carbonation.

Taste:
A huge chomp of just-ripe, yellow mango topped with shreds of candied orange peel. Then, lemony Citra and the tropic sweetness of Amarillo rise like flowers from the distinct, new earth flavor of Mosaic hops. Concludes on a long, low, afterburn of hop bitters and sauvignon blanc.",4.53

Enjoy By IPA,"Enjoying 1/1/21 version on 2/3/21. Unfiltered, but I would not have known except it was labeled as such. Smell is of orange, mango and banana bread. Taste and mouthfeel: Follows smell, citrus up front, creamy in the middle, with strong bitterness at end. But this is Stone. I've had better Enjoy Bys but the state of my tongue is always changing. Maybe I've had more good DIPAs since the first sampling of this beer.

Another DIPA (looking at you Hopslam) which appear regularly, but like an aging actor who has not realized younger and more sought-after options are grabbing the prime spots, refuses to lower prices. More people are passing. I saved $7 on this sixer by waiting two weeks after the Enjoy By date before picking it up. It was no worse, but not any better, either.

Putting all of this series in a single is a bit unfair because each is unique and some are better than others.

Smell: Pine, fresh cut citrus, tropical fruit, maybe some grape and peach, and just a hint of solvent. A lot going on.

Taste: Nicely hoppy, lots of citrus, pine, tropical fruit, some peach and pineapple, bready malt for balance, and a sharp bitter finish with pine and grapefruit.

Mouthfeel: Good carbonation, very smooth and approaching creamy thickness. Sticky on the teeth and some lingering spiciness on the tongue.

Arrogant Bastard Ale,"This beer is so good! This was one of the first brews that has extreme levels of hop IBUs that I ever tried, long ago...
Look: Expansive light-khaki colored head that extends a finger above the rim of my snifter, and leaves so much lacing, all atop a cloudy, deep crimson body. Smell is a bit of citrus on top of dark fruit, on top of a hop factory, with caramel drizzled on top of all of that. Taste is relentlessly hoppy, leaving hop resin in the mouth so very thick, leaving an extremely bitter aftertaste, that in my opinion, is quite pleasing. I'd be lying if I said this tasted like anything but a hop hurricane in the mouth. Mouth feel is actually very smooth for being such an abrasively hoppy brew. Carbonation is above average, but it makes this hop tornado so sparkling and delicious. ABV is all there, but I don't know of many people who drink strong ale that shy away from a little booziness. Overall a fantastically hoppy brew. LOVE it.",5.0
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Older bottle just over a year but hopefully the darker color and abv helped it age. 22oz bomber.

On the pour a fine 1 finger head forms that slowly recedes to a very light covering and a ring around the glass. Light haze, and very dark, a murky reddish brown that lest some but not a lot of light through. Light lazy carbonation, no lacing.

Aroma is very nice despite the age. Some traditional west coast IPA notes and some nice floral aromas on top of an earthy chocolate caramel malt note. Some umami and a slight dryness on the finish presumably from the age, but it all ties together quite nicely.

Flavor follows the aroma pretty closely and introduces some fig and date dark fruit flavors followed by a stouty and hoppy bitterness. Still quite drinkable and smooth despite the bitterness nice and complex, lots of flavor but surprisingly balanced. And not as aggressive as the bottle makes it out to be, but perhaps that's just modern tastes talking.

Feel is quite big and chewy. The abv makes itself known relatively quickly too even when paired with food, and let me tell you 22ozs of 7.2abv will get you there, so don't be an arrogant bastard. Also quite filling.

Overall a beer that's big in every way, hoppy malty, mouthfeel, and abv, but without being completely overwhelming or gimmicky, although a small bit of both. It's a good beer for those who want big malts and big hops.",4.09
Arrogant Bastard Ale,I love this beer! So different from all the others. A nice hit of malts & hops with an incredible bitterness that really lingers. The sweetness of the malt comes thru more as it warms. That bitter aftertaste is so good.,4.84
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Look: Dark bronze/sapphire body with a head that reminds me of a latte. Lacing throughout.

Smell: Raisin bread. slight candied orange notes. Slight grapefruit. Citrus and baking spice if I had to sum it up. Complex indeed.

Taste: Orange zest, intense pine. Some fresh dark bread notes. Slight raisin, slightest black pepper alcohol burn on the finish.

Feel: Creamy body. Quite drinkable for a +7 % ABV. I can't imagine trying this beer on Nitro, I think it'd take it to the next level.

Overall: This is one of the gateway beers that got me into craft beer. Distinctly remember it being the early 2010's and becoming burned out on the typical West Coast IPA (ironic because it's come full circle and that's my favorite style yet again) and wanting to try something different. Then and now Bastard has been a refreshing look on a style I'd otherwise not consider. Just a really well-made beer. Probably not your every day brew, but this was a great ""random"" beer to have today.",4.22
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Appearance: Pours a clear ruby color with a nice cap of light khaki colored foam.

Smell: Sweet, toasty, floral and slightly medicinal. Islay Scotch barrel aged Robitussin with a massive dose of hops.

Taste: Sharp and bitter hops up front. Malt contributes a bit of sweetness at the get-go but quickly shifts to a drier and heavily toasted taste. It's difficult for me to pick out any one flavor in particular. It's a complex beer but it's also a barrage on the senses. Rye comes to mind as does charred toast, peat, bitter tylenol-like hops and some oak. Heavily bitter all the way through.

Feel: Medium bodied, sharp carbonation, dry.

Overall: Not an easy drinking beer, but I didn't expect it to be anyway. I can totally understand how some people might not like it, but I've been a fan for close to 10 years now. When I want something to light up my palate I go for one of these. Well worth the money.",4.3

It must be my bottle, but it feels like the back end of the flavor is missing from what I remember.",3.88
Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Dark reddish copper, clear, off-white head. Smells like toasted raisin bread, on the subtle side. Theres some light citrus notes as well. There’s an initial taste of caramel malts and biscuit immediately followed by a freight train of intense hop bitterness. You can vaguely taste some slight pine/citrus/spice from the hops but it’s mostly just early addition bittering hops that almost make it seem “hot”. No doubt about it, the labels right, if you’re a casual beer drinker or someone who is not very schooled in beer styles you will definitely not like this.

This is a really nice holiday brew that most hop heads and IPA lovers will like. ABV is what you would expect, but it isn't boozy. A well-crafted American IPA.",4.25
Celebration,"Poured from a 12oz can
On the pour the color is dark for an IPA, almost red, but still in the amber range decent head looks frothy with some bigger bubbles, fair retention. Very light lacing that doesnt love to stick around.

The smell hits as soon as you start pouring. Strong piny hops are strong in this one, definitely a wesr coast/traditional american feel on the nose. Malt is largely overshadowed in the smell, but on the back there is a hint of resinous citrus.

Taste is very strong and a classic bitter american IPA but the hop nuance still shines through beyond the bitter. The malt is much more present in flavor and imparts an amber malty sweetness carrying it along nicely. As a malt head myself I appreciate that. The alcohol is detectable bit not in a boozy way per se, more in addition to the hoppy bitterness. The bitterness does tend to stick around for a bit after a sip.

The feel is quite heavy I must say but it certainly warms you up as it should, as a winter seasonal. I can see this being a favorite for the ipa crowd for sure.

Overall a bit hoopy for my taste but I could see that coming, however the hop flavors are of very high quality and the piny hops are a nice touch for an interesting take on seasonal holiday beers.",4.0

Aroma: Strong and complex aromas of orange citrus, bread, bananas, and Belgian spices. A candied sweetness underneath.

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread notes, a sweet yeast that leaves flavors of citrus, grapes, banana, and Belgian spices of clove and coriander. A light astringency. Then a sweet and bready finish.

Feel: A heavier-body. Strong carbonation and yeast. A soft, full mouthfeel. Surprisingly clean for the sweet body. (4.25+)

La Fin Du Monde,"Best before 5/28/2024 - consumed on 3/27/2022. Poured from a caged-and-corked 750mL bottle into my Unibroue tulip.

Lightly cloudy sunglow body supports a lasting finger of baby powder crema. Fine, dense lacing; no legs; superior retention.

Sweet gentle aromatics suggest honey, ripe pear, and hints of spice (cinnamon/coriander/clove/white pepper?). A touch of banana as well.

Palate entry follows the nose, but is followed by a hefty malt note, more phenols/spice, and a low but lingering bitterness. Earthy/grassy/not-quite-floral hop flavors emerge once in a while. House yeast character is present, but by no means dominant. Medium finish with a hint of curaçao (orange), overripe banana, and alcohol.

Medium-bodied, well carbonated, and fairly warming.

While lacking the complexity of the better Belgian examples, this remains one of the best domestic/North American renditions available.",4.27
La Fin Du Monde,"Sampling a cellar temp 750 ml bottle that I picked up at the store 2 weeks ago. Date stamp of best before 04-19-2024 on this corked and caged bottle.
Pouring into my snifter, the beer is a bright gold color, almost champagne like out of the glass. A creamy bleached white head foams up 2 cm and rests as a sturdy surface layer that remains through the tasting. I also have dense clingy lattice when I swirl the glass or take a sip. Several very fine streams of carbonation rise to the surface of the glass.
The aroma is some biscuity malt, a little bit of fruit note with pears and green apple and some white grape. I also get a little lemon and maybe some coriander. No real booziness giveaway.
First sip reveals a medium body with a bit of crisp texture and fine tingly and fizzy carbonation. The bubbles foam up in my mouth with no swirl. Definitely a little prickly carbonation.
Flavor is some sweet fruit with pears and white grape moving to cloves and coriander and then a little black pepper the bites on the finish. No warming booze, but the bite seems to be abv related. Finish is very dry and encourages me to take another sip.
the flavors on this beer are bolder than some other recent tripels and I enjoy the combination of tastes. Quite a solid beer that will sneak up on you with well hidden booze.",4.49
La Fin Du Monde,"Poured from 12oz bottle

The look is highly carbonated with a dark golden lightly hazy body. 2 finger head on the pour larger bubbles, shrinks down to a one finger head of fine bubbles. After sitting for a bit carbonation is still quite lively. Some lacing.

The aroma iels essentially all belgian yeast with a light crackery malt on the back end. Slight funk sort of makes me think of an older bottle of an AAL, the funk however fits this style much better than a lager, but still throwing me off a little bit. Some fruity esters also detectable.

The flavor is quite similar to the smell, some light citrus notes followed by banana esters and some hints of clove. Perhaps some of what I'm picking up is the spice it was brewed with as the bottle says. I'm not sure what the spice is. After the ferment character once again some crackery malt shines through. The malt is also sweet and present on the first sip before being overwhelmed by yeast character.

Feel is dominated by the big carbonation. The head doesn't make this one creamy so much as carbonation bite dominates. Despite that the beer is not at all watery and sticks around on the palate for a while.

Overall a good belgian style trippel. I wasn't actually aware it was Canadian however until looking on BA here which docks the score a bit, but the beer itself is a good take on a trippel.",3.93
La Fin Du Monde,"A lively carbonated, highly quaffable trippel. This is one I always revisit over the years. Less sweet than most, but still full of those fruity esters, a beautiful floral bouquet awash with lingering spices. Tons of rich flavors are enlivened by the effervescence, more of a gulper than a smooth sipper. I could drink more of these in one sitting than I should",4.59
La Fin Du Monde,"Pours a hazy, light orange-yellow with a nice thick two inch head, that slowly recedes into one inch of a thick bubbly ring. Lighter than I expected — or maybe the Belgian Tripels I’ve had so far are just darker than usual.

Spices, cloves, and stone fruit. The aroma is more spice and fruit forward than malty or yeasty, so if that’s your thing for Tripels, you are going to love this. Oh, definite coriander on the nose as well.

The flavours are somewhat mild for the style but pretty complex. It follows the aromas pretty tightly, but I get a little more malt and wheaty bread like notes here, to be expected. Nothing like Rochefurt Tripel or some other Tripels, but still a pleasant malt backbone. Which makes it finish relatively sweet, but more peppery than you might expect. Some nutmeg and caramel here as well. As always for this style, recommended to not serve ice cold, or to sip slowly and let it warm up and enjoy the evolution of flavours. The finish noticeably lengthens as it warms, and the malty notes in the back are strengthened as it decants. Some candied pear flavours come out here as well that I didn’t notice when it was cold!

Surprisingly light bodied, there is strong carbonation that foams with each sip, which brings out that peppery feel for sure. You will not taste the alcohol whatsoever. Finishes dry and sweet, and unlike a few other reviewers, I did not notice much acidity or bitterness whatsoever.

Due to the lack of ability to import, and LCBO restrictions, Ontario is not the best for international beers. But the one best thing about living here is access to Unibroue. All their beers are great and you can always get them fresh. My bottle was only a few weeks old.

Overall, compared to some of the Belgian Tripels, you might notice it’s a bit less sweet and more balanced in flavours. The malt and yeasty notes are there, but fairly mild. The fruity esters and spicy notes are more of a feature here. If this is your style for Tripels, I can see why this is ranked at the top. If you like serious malt, yeast, sweetness, some of the Trappist beers from Belgium dial it up more. This is still an absolute top tier offering and an absolute must-try for anyone who likes Belgian beers or tripels no matter how you prefer the style.",4.18
La Fin Du Monde,"Deep orangish-yellow, white head, decent retention and lace
Pear eau de vie, pepper, cloves, green banana, green peach, vanilla aromas
Pretty much tastes like it smells, minus the vanilla, peppery finish
Light bodied with appropriate carbonation
Forgot how good this is",4.76
La Fin Du Monde,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $6.00. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a dark & hazy goldenrod with a two-finger pale white head. Lacing is excellent; great legs.
S - Coriander, stone fruit, yeasty breads. Lemongrass, and nutmeg. A bit of white grape, as well.
T - Taste follows nose. Also getting a bit of raw sugarcane, clove, and citron. Finish is surprisingly dry, and peppery. Fairly sweet until the finish, but well-balanced flavor-wise.
F - Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and scarily easy-to-drink - I didn't even realize it was 9% ABV until halfway through the glass and I looked closer at the bottle!
O - Easily one of the best beers I've had; a must-try for everyone. From the color to the flavor, this brew sets the bar for non-Trappist tripels. Spicy, complex, and extremely satisfying. A bit on the sweet side, but the flavor complexity makes up for it. I do intend to purchase this one again, and would highly encourage one to buy it if they see it - even if the price seems a little high for a 12oz bottle.",4.83
La Fin Du Monde,"Nose: citrus fruits, apricots, mild grape, minor malt and alcohol smell. Easily one of the most appetizing beers I have experienced.

In the Glass: Beautiful medium/ dark amber. Pour with a good head as a Tripel should be enjoyed.

Palate: beautiful rich aromas become sweet and complex, FULL bodied, for a 9% alcohol Tripel there is no bite or harshness to La Fin Du Monde. I cannot stress the how full of citrus and sweet fruit this beer is, it is unbelievable that a beer could be this complex. Sweetness mixes well with the malt body. What a great experience

Finish: In the throat the sweetness leaves and moves into a smooth and somewhat more sharp finish. Once again I would never have guessed this is a 9% abv ale.

While this Tripel is extremely pricy in Ontario Canada, I urge all those who are into beers whether it be Belgian ales, wheat beers or IPAs, this is truly a great experience.
This is the only beer or beverage (I review a lot of single malt scotch whiskies) I would give a perfect rating.",5.0
Lagunitas Sucks,"Some scrappy notes from 2018. 6 pack of 12 ounce bottles.
This beer pours a deep gold color and is crisp and bright tasting. It is sweet and slightly resinous and is extremely easy drinking for it's 8% ABV. I hope they continue to make it as it is one of my favorites from this brewery. Excellent!",4.46
Lagunitas Sucks,"355 ml bottle, at a breakfast joint in Petaluma. Deep golden to orange colour, large off-white head. Aroma and flavour of citrus, pine, caramel and sweet malts. Maybe a bit too far out on the sweet side for me, but still a fairly nice beer. Some alcohol in the finish. Anyway, I wouldn’t say that it sucks.",3.42
Lagunitas Sucks,"The name sounds like its referring to the brewery, with a bit of self-deprecation, but it's really about 2020. But this beer is the opposite of 2020. It's a dry-hopped DIPA with an abundance of complex flavors stemming from the multitude of grains used in its brewing. Lagunitas really hit the right combination. For a dry-hopped brew, it is a nice crisp bitterness. Checks all the boxes of a solid DIPA with big flavor.",4.18
Lagunitas Sucks,"Pours a gold color with a creamy white head. A little chill haze. It has a medicine taste, maybe because of the ABV? It's very hop forward but not my pint of beer. I like the regular IPA better. It does taste a little like the year 2020, so there's that.",3.39
Lagunitas Sucks,"Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass an off white 1F head is formed. Beer is 95% transparent and mid gold in color with tons of fine particulate. Really interesting!

On the nose I get some mild onion, pine, salt, malt grapefruit pith and rind. The aroma is intoxicating!

On the palate, WOW, orange, malt, salt water effervescence that is thirst quenching and makes me want more. It is a bit candylike and sticky thick but I want more. The malty stickiness is balanced with relatively mild hops that are grapefruit and pine. The finish is astringent and cloying but I like it because it is mellowed by the malt.

Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, cloying and tasty. Some dryness to cut the malt on the end.

I was not expecting this. I was expecting a hugely dank and super bitter beer with astringent roof peeling dryness. Not even close. Sweet candylike malt and restrained interesting hops make this a beer I will have again. A big tasty malty balanced hop bomb.",4.46
Lagunitas Sucks,"12oz bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Picked up a single from Total Wine for $1.99. I've heard a lot about this bottle for the past decade I've been a beer geek but this is the first time I've seen it in the wild. No discernable date on the bottle but some cryptic numbers printed on the neck.

Appearance - Very hazy. Even with backlight can only barely make out the hazy silhouette of my hand. Small one finger white head. Irregular going from fine to pancake batter with variable bubble size. Good retention, decent lacing and stick. 4.25

Smell - Grassy, sweet, lactic. Even a little floral. Interesting. Fairly weak for an Imperial though. 4.25

Taste - Ho ho ho. Good kick in the mouth. Yet still soft and cushiony. Somehow has a strong, bold up front pretense but with no harshness or off tones or over-bitterness. Impressive in that regard. I appreciate it. Very unique. 5

Mouthfeel - No harshness. Yet bold. 5

Drinkability - Extremely drinkable. Very sessionable for any beer let alone one at this ABV. World class easily, master crafted. No off tones whatsoever. No hiding flaws under strength. 5",4.78
Lagunitas Sucks,"12 oz bottle dated 260 (9/16/20) poured into a Teku on 12/24/20.

Pours a 2"" fluffy white head. Golden orange and semi-transparent. Intense sticky lacing.

Dank, spicy, herbal, and musky hop aromas. Sweet malty booze with a subtle peppery scent.

Strong dank herbal flavor. Increasingly bitter finish with a musky quality. Sweet, but not balanced. Much more bitter.

Sticky, oily, resinous mouthfeel. Moderately carbonated. Smooth and easy-drinking apart from the drying and bitterness.

Complex and predominantly hoppy in the weedy, dank direction. The alcohol isn't hidden, but it doesn't overpower. A very well-made dank DIPA.",4.75
Lagunitas Sucks,"12oz bottle. No dating but the verbiage around the label talks about going to a brighter and wiser 2021.
Brilliantly clear, deep gold colored body. Not much of a head upon pouring but a partial white cap covers the surface. Each sip leaves behind a tiny spot sheen of lacing. Quite the enticement to rotate the glass while drinking in order to get full glass coverage.
Aroma at a chilled temperature is hidden but bready malts and resinous hops come through.
Taste is full. Slightly sweet but well balanced with citrus, pine, and resin. The suggestion of bitterness is swirled and tempered by the floral sweetness. Leaves a buzz in the mouth, and the aftertaste continues the back and forth, with a resin high note.
Medium mouth feel. The stickiness of the resin also expresses in the mouth. Excellent carbonation.
As mentioned on the label, this is an excellent palate cleanser brew. Very expressive but without excess. Enjoyable.",4.29
Lagunitas Sucks,"I'm not usually in the mood for an IPA, but when I am I usually look for one that is really well balanced. Some IPAs just bludgeon you with hops and bitterness. I like hops, I like bitterness, but I like them in measured amounts. Lagunitas Sucks nails it. This is GOOD BEER. Dark amber, almost caramel in color with a thick white head. Not much on the nose, a little floral, piney. Taste is spectacular. Hoppy, malty, botanicals and pine. Lightly sweet, and a nice light bitter finish. Medium high carbonation. Lighter body, but not wimpy by any means. I'll definitely grab this again the next time I'm in the mood for an IPA. I'm pretty blown away that this is 8% abv. It is so smooth and drinkable. This is truly a quality beer.",3.91

Ten FIDY,"Reviewed near blind... all I know whilst making these notes is it's American and high ABV%.
L- Pours jet black, with an impressive 3Cm notably very dark tan head. The head lingers for 10mins (as I was then distracted), now down to about 3mm + heavy lacing which is a heck of an achievement for this ABV% of beer where the surface-tension usually zaps the head super quickly.
S- Whiskey, treacle + timber barrel.
T- Molasses/black treacle, super deeply intense/pungent, notable whiskey, then up it comes a solid ABV% zing - bam!
F- Rich but not outright sweet. It's super-pungently flavoured, so much so it's a reeeal slow-sipping beer, just waaay too intense to sup as usual. Be aware if drinking on a hot night that the beer might materially warm in the glass before you can enjoy it all.
O- I'm often in a quandry to know how to rate beers like this. No doubt it's BIG, but subtlety and balance are harder to achieve IME and a nobler achievement, and a high ABV% CAN achieve that. It has a *very* shouty ABV%; and 12.5% isn't even that high (try visiting Iceland for properly high ABV% beer hehe) ... usually not considered good brewing if the ABV% is whacking your palate, albeit from a liquor barrel aged beer. Would I drink it again, no thanks it's way too big a shouty statement; I've had far higher ABV% beers than this that have achieved subtlety and balance.

Ten FIDY,"L - Poured from a can into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass. Huge frothy two and a half finger chocolate head on aggressive pour. Lots of lacing. Dark opaque color

S - Scent was a chocolate, malt, roast, and caramel. So many great smell. Sweet. A little boozy.

T - Taste follows scent. Dark Chocolate and bitter chocolate. Roasty. Sweetness in there as well. Some dark fruits as you drink. Toward the end, the coffee notes are more present, which I don't prefer.

F - Great carbonation and frothiness. Enjoyable mouthfeel.

O - Overall this is a great beer, but as with other beers with coffee flavors, I’m not a fan, since I don’t like coffee. Despite that fact, this was still a good beer for me. I’m glad I tried it, and I would definitely recommend it to any coffee fans.",4.2
Ten FIDY,"Look: Jet black on the pour and in the glass and even my delicate pour prompts a huge light brown head to explode and pillow up, eventually relenting some and leaving awesome lacing behind
Aroma: Roast, dark chocolate, ethanol, roasted barley, bready notes, earthy hops, and blackstrap molasses
Taste: Brown bread, baking cocoa, and roast jump out and tailed by wafts of alcohol heat which all hold for a second before earthy and slightly spicy hops come out to play. A little molasses and light brown sugar wafts are noticed in the background and closes with roast, chocolate, and booze along with a big bite
Mouthfeel: Full, somewhat silky, medium-high carbonation, and a very dry and robust finish
Overall: I dig it. This beer is big and means business and you can tell both of those things right away. I hadn’t had this in years and it was like I remembered in that it’s a hoppy and big Imperial Stout that flexes its muscle throughout and is a well-made and good one as well. A must-try for Imperial Stout/Russian Imperial Stout fans and I’m glad that its cold outside as this one is definitely a belly warmer.",4.27
Ten FIDY,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack. Canned 9/25/21, so this beer is almost 4 months old. I had this in the fridge and allowed it to come up to room temperature before I cracked it open.

Look: Pours out a very dark almost black color. There was a thick, rocky brown/dark tan colored head that slowly reduced to a thin layer, leaving behind some nice looking lacing.

Smell: Smells nice. Intense dark chocolate, coffee, sweet notes of marzipan and vanilla and some booze. There are also secondary notes of dark fruits. It has a nice roasty aroma.

Taste: Interesting. Up front, it is very dark and roasty and there are also some sweet pastry type notes (think brownies and chocolate cake). The finish lingers long and is more bitter than I expected - lots of roasted malt and there is a strong charcoal flavor on the finish. I think that there is a lot of bitterness and some oiliness from hops that is coming out in the finish. This beer definitely does not taste like it's 10.5% ABV, although I do get some warming in my chest as I consume more of it.

Feel: The mouthfeel is medium bodied, and has a very interesting finish. I would say that it is a bit thin for what I was hoping for.

Overall: I haven't had this beer in years. My old roommate and I used to split cases of this beer. It's definitely one of the quintessential American imperial stouts, and its availability has stood the test of time. I guess that my main criticism is that it doesn't taste as complex as some other great imperial stouts that I have had. Perhaps it would benefit from aging?",4.29

An incredibly firm and deep stout. It is boozy, firm tannins, very dark with a dark tan head, roasty toasty, dark bitter chocolate and molasses. It has a lot of staying power on the palate and is staining. It's great flavors are bold and powerful overall and is quite excellent tasting. Amazing beer in a can.",4.43
Ten FIDY,"Guess I'm too stoned or something lmao, I've had a solid share of imperial stouts now and this sucks to me. I taste sweet booze and nothing else. Maybe it's somehow still cold but I'll stick to breakfast stout, KBS, Expedition, Narwhal, idk dude this is somehow one of the worst I've had.",3.04
Ten FIDY,"One sip propelled this Imperial Stout into my top 3! I didn’t have to evaluate it. That’s a good sign. Seeing how dark it was, I expected it to be thick-n-chewy, sweet, and have a lot of alcohol burn.
Holy shit!…It had more balance than an olympic gymnast and an exceptional roasted malt complexity which carried throughout the finish. I avoid canned beer at all costs, but I really wanted to try this one so I took a chance on it. Poured into a stout glass and cooled just long enough, I indulged. I expected the typical regret of a curiosity purchase, but instead I was thrilled at the discovery of a new favorite! Although I was amused by the name of this beer, it actually detracts from this seriously well crafted Imperial Stout.",4.77

Appearance - Pours a dark jet black with two fingers of frothy mocha tan head.

Smell - earthy, leafy, and floral hops, coffee bean, roasted malts, dark fruits (raisin and fig), cocoa, and earthy yeast.

Taste - earthy, leafy, and floral hops upfront. Then quickly goes into the bold coffee bean, cocoa, roasted malts, and dark fruits (raisin and fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes velvety smooth with the bold coffee bean and cocoa with a nice lingering alcohol warmth.

Overall - A stellar imperial stout that has been on my radar for quite some time. If you come across this don't leave your local liquor store without a can or two. A pleasant sipper.",4.49
Ten FIDY,"This shouldn't take more than a twelve ounce can poured out and into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. It's expresso black-brown with a tidy tan head that is lasting. There's a strong aroma of roasted malt which is influenced noticeably by oak tannins. The taste is incredibly rich and complex. There's roasted malt, tannins, hops, alcohol and even some chocolate. The body is amazingly rich and smooth, especially considering all that it's delivering. There is sufficient glass lacing to bear witness to the quality of this brew's body. This may be a little too much for those that like a less whiskey influenced ale, even though the tannins are pretty well balanced by the other tastes. The ABV is high and somewhat noticeable, so that may also put off some. Overall, this is an obviously great example of brewing craftsmanship. But when you go this boldly, not all will follow.",4.47
Ten FIDY,"Pours opaque jet black with a thin but persistent tan rim.

Heady nose of malt, molasses, pumpernickel and black figs.

Palate is massive. First taste is a big bitter hit.beer swiftly envoloped by roasted malt, dark chocolate, espresso, caramel, with fruity fig and plum notes. Some sweetness but the bitterness lingers right through the long finish.

Very full bodied with minimal carbonation, unctuous mouthfeel, lovely lingering bitterness, lot of warm alchohol. Beautiful savoury beer.

This beer ages really well. Mellows some of the alchohol heat and the flavor marry wonderfully.",4.7
Ten FIDY,"It smells sweet with malts and a lot of bourbon. That's really all that I'm getting.

The taste is like bready bourbon up front and then you get a rich coffee bitterness.  The stout coffee flavor and the sweet woody bourbon complement each other beautifully and provide for a balanced taste.

This beer is full bodied and smooth with just a subtle carbonation that gives it an even thicker feel. The finish is clean with alcohol and coffee.

Overall this one is pretty damn fantastic. So balanced and the mouthfeel is great. I'm giving it a 5.8 out of 6... so good!",4.71

Smell is simply luxury - sweet and inviting, warm Holiday spices, sourdough bread, dark fruit.

Overall, fresh, fulfilling, rich, nice in the head.,. one of the finest beers in the World.",4.6

Abt 12,"BBE 6/8/25. 33cl bottle to wine glass.

Look: Pours a dark, murky brown with a lightly brownish/beige fluffy head that lasts quite long and leaves just a bit of lacing.

Taste: Malty and sweet. Some roasty notes, some bitterness. Caramelized, almost burnt brown sugar. Dried plum and red apple.

Feel: Full mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation.

Overall: Prime example of the style. Very complex. Not too alcoholic despite its high ABV. Should be drank at the recommended temperature since it unfolds its full potential as it warms. Fantastic beer.",4.6
Abt 12,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a deep mahogany/brown color with about three fingers worth of fluffy head that slowly recedes leaving behind lots of chunky lacing.

Aroma pleasant, but a bit less robust than I expected. Bready with notes of raisins, plums, dates and a faint yeastiness that rounds out the beer.

Taste follows the nose closely, dark/brown bread, dark fruits, a mild spiciness, and a mild banana-esque yeast flavor. Medium bodied, slick on the tongue, and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is quite a pleasant beer that I look forward to revisiting.",4.32
Abt 12,Yah this one’s legit. Was happy to find at Rock&Brews Orlando. Smooth and trippel notes but so much more. Lovely feel. Very balanced without being too malty or too hoppy.,4.57
Abt 12,"Poured from a 75cL corked bottle into the biggest glass I have, a spieglau American wheat beer glass and It barely fit. A dark murky brown red letting almost no light through. On the pour I got a 2 finger head that started overflowing. After a little while it disappeared to nothing. Not all that carbonated looking.

Smell is very yeast forward with fruit notes and some malts coming through. Very similar to a dry wine with grainy notes very heavy smell. Some alcohol.

Flavor is quite similar to the nose but malts are much more present. Still some acidity and fruit notes mixing with the roast to make it a bit winey. Very dark and fruity beer at the same time. Some alcohol is detected but it seems to compliment the beer at warmer Temps (20 minutes out the fridge). Very nuanced beer.

Feel is a bit thinner than I would've expected. I thought it would be thicker from all the grain that went into it. But its still very nice and almost easy to put down if it wasn't so extremely flavorful.

Overall, its a very interesting beer with lots of flavors to explore. This beer is pretty extreme to the point of giving me winey vibes, but still at its core it is beer. This is my first experience with a real belgian ale other than an old bottle of duvel a long time ago so I don't know all that much about the style. However I enjoyed this beer",4.24
Abt 12,"Some fluffy, beaten egg white foam forms over a deep copper, almost brown body. There's some sediment floating about, but not as much as anticipated considering I can't remember how long ago I purchased this bottle. Been meaning to pop the cork for awhile now. Smells super bready and yeasty, but not in the way you generally find typical of Belgians. This is its own thing, at least to my nostrils. Lots of sweet, dark fruit; figs and such. Also some fruity notes you wouldn't necessarily expect with raspberries standing out to me. Smells fookin' great. Tastes it as well. Not as good as implied by the nose, but very tasty all the same. Yeasty up front with a fruity middle and a bready finish. Nowhere near as boozy as I'd assumed with something of this octane. Low carbonation suits this beer very well. Complex yet easy drinking beer = big thumbs up from me.",4.18
Abt 12,"L - Poured from. 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 60 degrees. One finger tan frothy head. Dark opaque brown color. Frothy lacing just stays on the glass walls

S - dark fruits like cherry, raisins, etc. and sweet bread malt scents.

T - taste follows scent with sweet bread and dark fruits. Some alcohol comes through at 10% ABV, but it’s more balanced and easy to drink than you would expect. The lightest of a floral hop bitterness in the taste. A little smoky/toasty cola comes through on some tastes as it warms up. Agitating it half way through brings back the sweet flavors. The complexity is great.

F - frothy and great thick mouthfeel. Solid carbonation.

O - This is a great beer. Obviously at 10% ABV this is a one drink and done. But the scent and flavors are excellent. Nice complexity with each taste and smell. I really enjoyed the fact that agitating/swirling partway through brought back the initial flavor and scent profiles. All in all, even at the higher ABV, I drank this one pretty fast as I kept going back for different tastes. Highly recommended as I add this to my annual rotation.",4.68
Abt 12,"Pours a deep ruby, two inch off tan head that fades after two minutes

Rum soaked deserts, malt, bread, raisin on the nose.

The look is strong, aromas fairly decent, but the drink is where the beer is, as described, formidable. Tastes of sugared bread, dried fruits such as raisins and even dried candied melon and cherry. Powerful malt backbone that lasts for days

General alcohol warmth to the sip. Assertive mouthfeel with good carbonation. My beer hid the bitterness quite well, with the sweet malt notes winning every time. Might be due to this bottle being a little older (likely).

As it warms the beer opens up quite a bit. The malty, bready notes are even more prominent if that’s even possible. Once again that rum raisin alcohol warmness presents itself. What is harder to describe is the melding of multiple flavours and tastes that’s hard for me to pick out. I’d love to come back to this beer eventually.

Complex, and even more so as it warms. One of those beers that deserves a revisit every year. I wish I could give this a better review; I chose this beer as its strong as we just receive news Russia has invaded Ukraine. A beer, a moment in time, I don’t think I’ll ever forget and will likely become a home for me and my memories in the future.",4.33
Abt 12,"Beautiful look and scent to this classic. Big tan head, wonderful lacing.

Taste of biscuits and prunes. Quite sweet, although that tapers as it warms. Heavy, with some alcohol warming. Big mouthfeel, malt that lingers for days. Excellent balance for such robust flavors.

Formidable brew",4.53
Abt 12,"Overall: a triumphant beer that definitely stands out when you want a heavy beer but not a stout. It reminds me of old/stock ales but with less hops and bitterness. Tastes of raisin, rum, bread, and a slight pucker from prunes.

Great right ahead or right after the coldes of months, or when you need something to sip all night and a stout would be too much.

I do think there may be better quads, but as of yet I haven't found one that tops Abt 12.

Look: a dark mahogany brown that looks almost deep purple if not under light. Beautiful lacing with the a thick head that dissipates into a nice creamy top coating of bubbles.

Smell:right up in your nose, this one carries a pervasive aroma though it's not heavy. I catch the smell of Belgian yeast (sharp/sour) and it's lovely.

Taste: don't tackle this one when it's too cold, I enjoyed it after 40+ mins out of the fridge. Bold flavors that are balanced between raisins, prunes, rum, and dark bread. Loved that I can't taste any rock sugar, a common issue with me and high ABV Belgian beers.

Feel: top of the mouth silkiness and a long lasting presence on the top of the mouth/cheeks.",4.13

Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Brief review from when I had this at a restaurant

Big frothy head that quickly dissipates, it has a very lovely, crystal clear amber colour.

Noble hops present in the body of the beer, pleasant bitterness backed by a predominantly caramel malt backbone. Very crisp, light-medium bodied. Loved the bitter ring on the finish, with the malty vanilla grain notes gently riding out as well.

One of the best macro offerings for sure. Had a lot of craft that was even as good as this.",3.68
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Beautiful medium amber color with thin off-white head. The smell is average, with a hint of malt. The first sip is malty and bready, that turns into toffee. I am a big fan of carbonation and wouldn’t mind a little more in this brew- but it is an adequate amount which allows you to experience the transition of flavors. I typically don’t notice this much flavor movement in macro beers, but this one is prevalent and welcomed. The finish is semi-dry with nearly no bitterness. It is like drinking a full bodied beer without the full bodied fullness. I had one once before, but I was already pretty drunk and didn’t appreciate it for what it is. It’s no Coors Banquet, but it definitely is worth revisiting if you haven’t become a total beer snob! (Haha) …and who doesn’t love their commercials?! I give this a solid 4 in my humble opinion and I would not turn this down if offered. When it comes to complexity of taste- this is truly the King of the macros.",3.96
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"L - Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass. One and a quarter finger off-white head on an aggressive pour that fades down to a bubble film that stays throughout the drink. Medium amber brown color. Clear with no haziness. Medium lacing on the glass.

S - Malts up front with a bread or cracker scent. Some mild toastiness. Some mild earthy tones as well.

T - Caramel Malts are front and center. Light toastiness on the back end. Some sweetness in there. Minimal hop flavors with almost no bitterness.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some frothiness. Medium carbonation.

O - Overall, this is a solid malt-forward beer. Sam Adams Boston Lager has been a standard beer for me for many years. It’s one of the better all-around beers for someone who is not a hop-head. Great smooth malt flavors. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to all.",3.69
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Look - color is somewhat copper and pretty clear. Head was about 1 finger size and dissipated quickly.

Smell - A little malty with hints of toffee and vanilla.

Taste - The taste surprised me because the hops are more present than I expected based on the smell. It was a nice surprise and gave good depth to the beer.

Feel - Good, standard lager with moderate carbonation.

Overall--a good, but not fancy beer. It seems like a pretty safe choice and should appeal to a lot of people, but doesn't have the complexity of so many of the craft beers out there. Still, probably my favorite macro lager that is available most places.",3.77
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"A nice looking crystal clear, cooper body with a thick head. Not very intense but pleasant aroma, fragrant grain & floral hops. Very mild hop bitterness with a dry finish. Crisp, clean taste: malty goodness with bread & spice. Average viscosity for a lager. Nothing special but still very good.",3.62
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"My favorite, because it allow me drink a great beer everywhere. I have tried others as good but all are locals this one is in all US. Best comercial beer so far.",4.87
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Pours a translucent copper/burnt orange color, with a fast receding foamy whit head. Smell mild hints of toffee and vanilla. Taste is bready,malty and nicely hopped. This is a tasty beer.Feels almost thin bodied,finishes semi dry. Overall this in my opinion is a different brew than 35 years ago when they were trying to make a name for themselves. This was my go to beer and if I moved to another State that did not stock it , I would tell the owners how fantastic this beer was. ( I may as well have worked for them) it was the best beer, (also Anchor Steam) at the time in the US market- This seems like a cheapened version on every level of ingredients. It was a beer I would have rated a 4.5. This on the other hand shows what mass production can do to quality of ingredients. Last time I drank this ,SAM Adams was trying to impress, now they are a small conglomerate who makes mediocre beer. Sad that success destroys the product-",3.46
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,Only pick this beer up when it's very fresh. I wouldn't even recommend picking this up if it still has 2 months left on it's freshness labeling. Big fluffy head that lasts throughout the beer. Well balanced malt and hop flavors. I swear this beer used to be under 5%. Either way it's miles ahead of the majority of craft attempts.,4.16
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"This is a beer that I could drink over an hour or 45mins. It has a nice color to it, and a crisp flavor that hits your tongue right away. Had a dry feel to it with some bitterness at the sides of your mouth. You can definitely taste the hops, leaving it more honestly bitter than I expected and some spice notes with that. The IBU rating will deceive you. It taste like an inoffensive beer with a strong hop flavor. Was excited to try this and it disappointed. Not bad.",3.38
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (beers for cheers)
The look is a nice solid to light amber with average carbonation. Head on the pour isnt spectacular, but what does form sticks around for a while. Crystal clear

Hops are very present on the nose, but almost all bittering hops. Very classic hop scent blending very well into the malt backbone. Very pleasant scent. Herbal earthy and malty.

Taste almost resembles a pale ale. Hops largely overpower any lager characteristic, much unlike their winter lager. Still easy to put down and inoffensive but much more bitter than most lagers I've had despite the claim of 30 IBU on the bottle. Wish the malt was stronger on the taste. It does come through in the after taste though.

Feel is like most lagers easy to put down not too heavy and pretty refreshing the strong hops detract from refreshing as much but that's not a huge deal it came in a winter pack.

Overall a pretty good hoppy lager. Choppier than a traditional pils, but nothing crazy. Flavors are all ones you've had before, but maybe not in a lager. Pretty good definitely better than most macros flavor wise but maybe not refreshing wise.",3.66
Samuel Adams Boston Lager,"Dark copper colored with a quarter inch of beige head on top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark, bready malt and a touch of grassy hops. I’m tasting caramel and marzipan with a touch of grassy hops in the fade. The mouth is crisp and refreshing.",3.77
IPA,"This is a 12oz. can with an aggressive pour into the 20oz. weizen glass. For starters I have a three fingers of thick foam that is not quite pure white. The ale has an orange tint, the brew is clear with a steady stream of carbonation. The head has settled to one finger, with thick lacing left behind.
The aroma is the IPA pine and sweet citrus., not overly strong but the scent is noticeable from a distance.
The flavor is sweet grapefruit, then a bit dry, with some light hop bitterness. This is a great blend, not too sweet and not too tart.
The feel is somewhat light, this ale is very refreshing and a great nightcap after cutting several trees up on this late August evening. I know I will revisit this IPA! I think if I was an IPA guy, this would be the one!!!",4.29
IPA,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass at Shrimp Shack in beautiful Fort Myers, FL.
Another of what I like to call ‘complimentary’ beers.
It ‘goes with’ … dot dot dot.
Taken on its own, it’s probably ‘just a common IPA’. But put it next to, say, a shrimp po’ boy, and it takes on a life of its own and makes the entire experience palpable.
And that makes this an OK sud.

IPA,"Look...a clear copper with a thin off white head.
Smell...A hop floral spice dank. hints of caramel malt.
Taste...A sweet resinous grapefruit with pine, a bitter resin caramel with a segway of fruit to a
dry finish.
Feel...An ample mouth full that makes this beer taste bigger than it is. slick and lip smacker
Overall...A beer I have yet to try in so many years and all of the other beers I have had from Lagunitas. A good and solid beer I would have again and hope it to be fresher than 2 months old. I feel this beer woudl be a little better fresh just like most IPAs. Anyways very solid",3.65

IPA,"Notes of grapefruit. Deep gold color. Very hoppy flavor. Overall a good IPA for less than $2/bottle, and it's available at most gas stations. Hard to be upset with this beer.",3.81
IPA,"Pours a nice golden color with a 1” white head. Lacing is very nice. Drinking my 2nd one of these for the night…the 2nd is even better than the first. I’m a huge fan of Lagunitas and love several of their IPA offerings but never had tried their original IPA; I figured it was time to. The head and smell of this brew is so delightfully refreshing and tantalizing. This is definitely the most balanced IPA I’ve ever drank. It’s not hop loaded nor malt loaded…it’s just a very balanced, mild IPA, with an overall nectarine/peach flavor to it. Definitely a wonderful session IPA that I will drink again.",5.0
IPA,"Pours a clear, coppery-yellow colour. A one finger head bubbles down into a spotty yet creamy cap.

Incredibly unique aroma that I have not encountered in the 73 beers I’ve reviewed so far. Earthy, grassy, floral and a bit savoury. I’m thinking this is due to the crazy amount of hop and malt mix in here. Hoping there is a nice mix in the palate rather than a haphazard one. Biscuity malts and straw, pine needles and dried fruit leaves.

Pleasant malt biscuitiness on the front of the tongue and a light pleasant bitterness on the back end that is mildly piney and just a bit citrusy. Grapefruit mostly. Pleasant mix of both and the malt and bready flavours shine out quite well.

Lightly bitter body that is pleasant with a bready aftertaste, this leans towards a lighter body with medium carbonation that is pretty classic.

43 hops and 60+ malts, wow. I’d say this leans to a more homogenized taste but it’s still nice and subtle and varied. Definitely not homicidally hopped, maybe at one point when it first came out. But it’s great to have it to remember what benchmark, typical IPAs tasted like, both years ago and historically. They were nowhere near as hopped as they are now, and this provides a great benchmark for what IPAs, and even APAs in reference to IPAs should/used to taste like.

It’s great and classic, very enjoyable. Our taste buds might be scorched by modern beers these days, sort of like how hardcore smokers with tarred up palates would drink the most peated, explosively fiery scotches and claim they barely taste it! It’s still very classic and enjoyable, much more than the average beer.",3.78
IPA,"Pours a semi-clear amber color with off white head and good lacing. Smells of biscuit, malt, dried fruit, very fresh with no skunkiness. Tastes of malt, biscuit, hops, and dried apricots with a hint of sweetness. Mouthfeel to me is very luxurious, with some carbonation and hops that lightly covers the tongue. This is a really good beer!",3.56
IPA,"This is the IPA that turned me onto IPAs. Before Lagunitas, Sierra Nevada Pale was my ""IPA."" I liked Lagunitas so much, that's pretty much all I drank and scarcely ever touched Sierra ever again... I tried everything from Lagunitas, Little Sumpin, Maximzizer, etc. and their seasonal selections. I drank it all until I literally couldn't anymore. I started to hate beer. I couldn't go back to Pale or Lager or anything. If it was beer, I literally couldn't drink anything but Lagunitas. So I switched to whiskey and it was perfect and I lost like 30 pounds from not drinking beer and I didn't look back for a long, long time, maybe 2 years. By the time I came back around to beer drinking, there was this whole new world of craft IPAs that were almost all better than Lagunitas. Lagunitas had become the ""IPA"" of Budweiser. I still enjoy it once and awhile and appreciate it--but much like I can hardly ever drink a Sam Adams ever again, I will be the same with Lagunitas now. It opened me up to a entirely new world of beers, but at the same time, I think the industrialization of it ruined it forever...",4.0
IPA,"This signature lagunitas IPA defined IPA for me and I absolutely love it!

Look: Beautiful clear amber-golden appearance with a medium off white head and leaves some lacing.

Smell: Light malty-ness and bready-ness with the classic piney hop presence.

Overall a very pleasant beer with 6.2% ABV and 51.5 IBU",4.38
IPA,"No discernible dating. Might be old, might not be. *shrug* - It's what's out there. (& why I haven't had this til now)

Short version : basic old-school WCIPA, well-done. Nothing special, ""just"" good.

The usual orangey-amber, with one finger or so of off-white head. Smells & tastes of pine and bitter citrus, with moderate, moderately-sharp carbonation bite , and medium feel.",3.77
IPA,It’s a stellar ipa. Taste and feel are there. Look is good enough. Smell is meh but who cares. As far as hip heavy IPAs go this is a home run. I came in a skeptic left a believer. Good stuff at Lagunitas. I wouldn’t call it homicidally hoppy bc I didn’t puke from the overly bitter taste covering up a poor product. Instead this quality brew made me laugh. Drink this and laugh.,4.34
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"This is a 120z. can given an aggressive pour into the 20oz. weizen glass. The ale has an orange tint with a thick three finger head. It has settled a little leaving some thick lacing behind. The carbonation is plentiful, offering a pleasant show in this beer.
The aroma is a tart citrus, noticeable instantly upon opening the can. There is a subtle wheat fragrance also.
The taste offers tart citrus with a navel sweetness. The finish is crisp, somewhat bitter, with plenty of sweetness also.
There is something rather smooth feeling here, but the hops hide that a little with the bitterness.
This is a refreshing, complex ale, true to Lagunitas review. For me it was very enjoyable to sample this IPA.",3.79
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"Bottle from American Vape & Craft Beer PHX , temp 50 degrees F, ABV 7.5%, IBU 64, nonic glass

A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"I had this one a long while back but finally trying again after experiencing a great (too?) many IPAs..

Very clear gold with a thin head... very subdued carbonation. Subdued aroma too but get some pine, grapefruit, banana?

I sipped with some hesitation because i remember this one biting me many years before (and i have a mildly difficult time with wheat beers). There is the undeniable ""Lagunitas backbone"" that i detect in all of their beers -- not sure if it's the malt, the water, or what. But it is interesting - the wheat beer side definitely melds well with the IPA side and makes this quite drinkable. I just find it rather unremarkable. Good beer - but it's a one and done for me and I won't go out of my way to find it.",3.78
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"Been wanting to try this one for a long time, finally broke down and bought some. Poured from can into pint glass a bright gold tone with medium white head that dissipated quickly. Aroma is so so, medium citrus note. Taste is balanced with a toasted wheat sense. Feels very smooth with a nice weight in the mouth. Finishes nice and dry. I appreciate most brews from Lagunitas, and I agree that this is some of their best.",4.29
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,I think Lagunitas describes it best: Way smooth and silky with a nice wheatly-esque-ish-ness. A truly unique style featuring a strong hop finish on a silky body. A hoppy pale wheat ale that is great for IPA fans but so smooth that the hefeweizen fans dig it too.,4.01
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,Poured a golden honey looking color with a white head. The smell was of tropical fruits and hops. The taste was pretty smooth with a hint of lemon and/or lime. A very good tasting beer that I've been happy to finally get.,4.23
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"L: A deep golden yellow with 1/2 inch white lace.
S: Hint of citrus
T: Well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the underlying the experience.
F: think with a nice bite at the end.
O: smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters.",3.81
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"I'm not a hoppy guy, but this I can actually drink on occasion. Piney but not as obnoxious (to me) as most, and with a bit of grapefruit flavor, it takes two things I don't like and seemingly cancels them out.Thicker than you expect, and oddly refreshing.",3.56
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,Tastes somewhere between a hazy IPA and a west coast IPA. Like the sweetness of the wheat but I feel like it's missing something. Ended up feeling torn on this one and ended up feeling a bit indifferent. Probably need to go through another six pack to form strong opinion. Would recommend if you like hazy's but want something more bitter than your traditional sweeter hazy.,3.58
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"Pours slightly cloudy with one-inch head. Smell oranges, biscuit. Taste is the same; the beer is a bit sweet but satisfying. At $9.99 a six-pack it is great value for a good beer.",4.12
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"L: A bit darker yellow but all the fizz and bubbles of an average beer. Little head and lace. A bit cloudy.
S: Orange and Grapefruit. Not strong.
M: Chewy and thick with quite a bit of bitter at the side and remainder.
T: Out of the park? If this is a ""wheat based"" IPA, I'm now a fan? I was impressed by how much balance yet how bitter this was. The primary fruitiness flavor doesn't have the ""Juicy Fruit"" of lots of the other similar beers. Like the scent, it is well rounded and subtle and lets the bitter handle the overall experience.
O: It's a great IPA that maybe might be too bitter for some, yet, smooth and full flavored is the backbone that matters.",4.42

A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"Nice golden color with a nice white head.

Nice smell, a mix of pines, hops. Taste is very rich, according to the smell pines, hops, citrics.

A nice rounded beer, will have more of it. Recomended",4.77
A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale,"Look: Nearly clear orange in color with a frothy white head that builds and holds as a lid, slowly receding and leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Pine, oranges, sweetened strawberries, ruby-red grapefruit, wafts of blueberries, sweet bready malt, and gooseberries
Taste: A huge mixed berry blend comes together and starts it off, soon followed by a sweet orange-led citrus hit. Pine and fresh baked bread weave in and out of the picture throughout and closes with berries, malt sweetness, and a light bite
Mouthfeel: Full, quite smooth throughout, medium-high carbonation, and fairly soft on the finish
Overall: I dig it. This is, and has been for years, my favorite of these folks’ offerings and unlike in my past, probably one of the only ones I still buy on occasion. When this beer is fresh, like this one is, it’s a winner with lots of nice hop flavor/aroma and the wheat malt component gives it a silky mouthfeel that rounds it out and keeps it from being sharp at all. A tasty hoppy pale wheat ale and one of the best, IMO",4.24
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Another classic. Actually quite enjoyable. I went to college in Boulder and don’t fully understand why this became so popular everywhere, but it it helped usher in the craft revolution and is a whole lot better than bud light.",3.9
Fat Tire Amber Ale,poured from a 12oz bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a light amber with a finger of off-white foam head. toasted malts on the nose with the taste following. it’s got decent mouthfeel. a little bland but it’s readily available and it’s no terrible.,4.13
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Nice amber color, fairly clear and pulls a alright head, not amazing but its something. Smells alright, nice hit of toasted malt, caramel and floral/citrusy hops. A tad bit of the yeast comes through on the nose. Taste is pretty good. Its very crisp and refreshing. The toasty malt hits you first, then you the hops, but not alot of bitterness. The finish is good, crisp and you dont get any alcohol. Overall great mainstream beer.",3.87
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"This review is mostly from memory from last night, couldn’t review it properly but not a big deal as this beer is pretty much just a straightforward, inoffensive amber.

No appreciable head on the pour but it is a gorgeous crystal clear, darker orange-amber colour. Genuinely amber. Very nice. Aromas of grassy but most flora hops, lightly toasty caramel malts. And the taste is identical on the palate. Not much else to say. I didn’t notice any ashy or burnt qualities personally, which for my palate might’ve actually been a nice spin (though burnt malt notes get you a little out of amber territory)

Light bodied with moderate carbonation, slightly prickly on the tongue, very crisp

It’s an average amber, better than any macro, underwhelming by modern craft beer drinker standards",3.53
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Pours spot-on amber. Amber amber. Tiny bit hazy. The head recedes quickly and leaves spotty lacing for whatever that's worth. Smells quite decent, orchard fruit, maybe apple, not too far off what you'd expect from a British amber ale. There's also a very subtle toasty aroma. Unfortunately it smells better than it tastes. The flavours are understated. More of that orchard fruit, but unfortunately none of that quintessentially British marmalade flavour. There is some gently bittering hops to balance it out. There is also a strange ashy flavour. Other reviewers described this beer as very biscuity, but I don't find that. It tastes somehow slightly burt and, well, ashy. That is subtle but not very pleasant, and the more you focus on it the more it irks. The mouthfeel is all right, no complaints. Overall it's not a bad beer but I'd only consider it one or two steps up from the average American macro swill. At least this has a bit of character.",3.52
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by April 10th yikes a little old but I'll adjust scores.

On the pour a white 2 finger head forms that quickly recedes back down to a 2mm head. Color is about as spot onto amber as you can get and there's a decently lively carbonation. No haze. Light lacing.

Smell is a bit old, but beyond the light skunkiness it reminds me of what I can only describe as belgian light beer. All I can really detect is the old hops and yeast not a lot of malt character here.

Taste is quite similar to the nose. There is some sweetness coming from the malt but it is mostly covered by the yeast character which is quite bright and belgian tasting, but not as strong as traditional belgian beer. Some malt aftertaste as would be expected from an amber. Not a bad flavor but slightly boring.

Feel is a bit light for the style. Definitely can see that it was competing with macros back in the day it's slightly heavier than a lager but it clears the palate fast and has a slight drying effect.

Overall this beer is better than I remember it but the flavors are quite subtle. Apart from the aged hops there's nothing off or offensive about this and it's very easy to drink but only a step or two up from traditional American macros. In Colorado this almost feels like a local macro. I wouldn't seek it out but I'd choose it over a few beers for sure",3.52
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Look: Nearly clear reddish amber with a creamy looking head that retains well and eventually settles, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Freshly baked bread, light toffee notes, wafts of dough, caramel, lightly toasted grains, and some malt sweetness
Taste: Caramel-dipped bread and tons of it starts things off as some doughy notes and toffee filter in behind. These components continue to develop and deepen along with some toasted grains and closes how it started
Mouthfeel: Full, pretty smooth, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and smooth finish
Overall: I dig it. A classic in its own right and a tasty and well-made Amber ale to boot. Probably not too exciting for some but it’s a great no-nonsense, easy-drinking, malty beer that is nice to have readily available pretty much anywhere and inexpensive to enjoy",4.0
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Sam Adams Perfect Glass at roughly 50 - 55 degrees. One and a half finger light tan head on an aggressive pour. Clear amber-brown color. Some lacing that fades.

S - Sweet malt up front. Creamy/buttery scent. Some light bread as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet buttery caramel malts. Light Biscuit. No bitterness, all straightforward flavor. A bit of toastiness as it warms up.

F - Good buttery medium mouthfeel. Good carbonation.

O - This is a good straightforward beer. The flavors are a basic caramel/biscuit malt, and there is no bitterness. This is a very pleasing beer that I would always choose ahead of the American mass market beers. In fact, I would classify this as one of my standard beers. Definitely in my regular rotation and would recommend to everyone.",3.97
Fat Tire Amber Ale,"Color is a dark amber that is translucent. Pour was nice with a small head that dissipated really quickly, leaving little bits of disconnected lace on the glass. I noticed the aroma instantly while pouring with the phenolic aroma characteristic of a Belgian style ale. Taste is very crisp, and notably well balanced in terms of sweetness, bitterness, and yeasty flavors. For a bBelgian style ale, it is somewhat muted, but in a way I think works very well for an easily drinkable rendition of this style. Overall, a very solid beer, I think the only reason I haven't rated it higher is because the style in general is not one of my favorites.",3.72
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"World's oldest brewery? Really? I'm sure I have had the world's oldest brewery beer before, and it wasn't this...

I used to love weissbier when I was about 20...but recently I haven't really liked it so much, anyway let's give this a go. I used to have an Erdinger glass at home.

Very typical bananaey aroma...heavy...sweet like a desert...not really inviting to me. Very smooth head and deep orange colour, looks great in the glass.

Taste is unique for sure. Very different to other weissbiers I have tried, such as Erdinger (my favourite beer around 20 years old). This is much lighter and ever so smooth. And not as sweet as the aroma makes you believe...but for me it's a bit too smooth, and a bit too unexciting...there is no complex mouth feel or bitter hop aftertaste of a Radeberger, West Coast IPA or Belgian tripel. Or the mystical smoothness of a Chimay Bleu. This is kind of simple, pleasant...and easy to like. I'm definitely not a fan of wheat beer, though I kind of understand why people would like this, though...in the same way people like ice cream. It's just not for me.",2.04

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Beer poured from tap.

The body pours an orange gold with a nice fluffy head. Good retention and lacing. A handsome beer especially in the right glassware.

Nose is the banana-bubble gum aroma for which the style is famous. Hit-or-miss for some folks, but a big hit for me. Add the familiar clove and I was a happy guy.

Taste substantially follows nose with the clove stepping up a bit. A bit sweet but a modest hop flavor is present helping balance the beer.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: 6301
Consumed on: 2022-july-26
Glass: 0.5L Weizen Vase
Pouring Temp:


Look:
Cloudy and opaque golden yellow. I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass when I hold it up to a light. 3-finger pillowy and creamy off-white head slowly dissolves to a 1-finger consistent and creamy cover. When I opened the beer, it slowly started pushing up out of its bottle. Some yeast looks to have remained on the bottom of the bottle, indicating that this sample will not be as opaque as 'normal'.

Smell:
All kinds of banana along with some sweet fruit that has been lightly sugared. Balancing this is a nice clove note. Wonderful nose.

Taste:
Similar to the nose but with the addition of wheat notes that come across as very slightly bready or perhaps doughy. There is also a mineral note. Everything is very nicely balanced. The finish is lightly sweet and clovey.

Feel:
Smooth, soft, and creamy. The body is not quite medium.

Overall:
A great Hefeweizen from a top-notch brewery. Quaffable, balanced, and refreshing. This is the benchmark for the style and has been so for decades. One of my favorite Hefeweizens, along with those from Andechs, Ayinger, and Schneider.",4.29

Banana, caramel & mild clove notes in the nose.

Creamy, medium mouthfeel.

Banana & mild caramel flavors up front; mild clove notes on the finish.

An exemplary take on the style; I'd have another! And another!",4.42
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Had 16oz on tap at RiNo Beer Garden

On the pour a 1.5 finger fine head just over the glass that slowly receded and became rocky and creamy looking. Color is a dark gold with standard hefe haze. Carbonation is light enough that it's hard to see through the haze. Some lacing forms if you drink it fast enough but not the best lacing ever.

Aroma is full of banana esters and a bit of acetaldehyde but not anymore than is expected of the style. Aroma is relatively light and not a lot of the malts come through this is all yeast on the nose.

Flavor is similar to the aroma with a certain lightness to it followed by a nice hit of traditional hefe flavors, once again a little tarter than I'd prefer, but nothing overwhelming or out of character for the style. There is a definite minerality to the flavorfollowed by some light bitterness and grassiness from a light dose of noble hops. Followed up by all that a sweet wheat maltiness does creep in making for a nice finish with a bit of sweetness after yeasty slightly bitter flavors.

The feel is once again a bit light and astringent, but the head retention on this makes for a relatively balanced light feeling making it not watery. The finish is relatively long for how light it is and in the chest you can feel the alcohol warming sensation a little bit.

Overall this is a good example of a traditional hefeweisen and a bit drier than the hofbrau hefe but without the citrus notes of an americanized hefe or traditional American wheat.",3.88

OVERALL: This is, to me, a perfect beer. It’s insane. It’s refreshing with just enough body to it to be rewarding without feeling bloated afterwards. The tastes are lovely and perfectly balanced, and there’s a variation in flavors between the glass and the bottle that are both wonderful in their own way. The best part about it is that it’s not even expensive, either. It’s like $11 for a 6pk at my local liquor store. That’s only $2 more than a 6pk of Heineken for THIS.",5.0
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured golden amber, not transparent but not cloudy either. Unfiltered?
The head was nearly white and fleeting but that may be due to the age of the beer.
The aroma was mostly cloves and, oddly, banana. At least the impression of banana.
The taste, wow. Cloves are prominent but not overwhelming, banana is more an essence than flavor, and the malts are balanced, tasty and rewarding. So good, I think I need more of this one for the summer.
The feel was smooth as the carbonation was slow and sparse, but present. Didn’t detract from the experience at all.
Not sure why I waited so long to try this, it’s really good!",4.59
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Wow. Poured at ~43 degrees F into a pint glass. Cloudy golden nectar with very fine bubbles in the finger of head that reduces to a film and a ring around the glass. If there was a banana Wheaties, this could be the mascot. Smell is, of course, banana, clove, nutmeg, as is taste, but more importantly, this beer does not include any of the previously stated foods as actual ingredients. This beer is brewed under the Purity Law of 1516, meaning it uses only malt, hops, water, and yeast. This philosophy of brewing has led to a masterpiece that lingers on the palette like you've just had a bowl of Cream of Wheat. Mouth feel is velvety creaminess; CO2 level perfectly present and fulfilling. Alcohol is hardly noticeable. Very smooth going down with a a slightly less than medium mouthfeel. Super easy drinker even on a hot Texas day. Easily the best wheat brew I've ever tried.",5.0
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"A: cloves, nutmeg, yeasty, malt aroma
L: hazy golden, good head retention, creamy foam, medium lacing
T: banana clove heavy, medium to heavy bodied, crisp carbonation
O: very smooth, drinkable, essence of hefeweizen",4.52
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from 330 ml bottle into pint glass. Thick pillowy white head, mild lacing, hazy golden orange color. Aroma of banana, spices, yeast rolls. Mouthfeel is light to medium. Flavors of clove, cinnamon, banana, bread, herbal hops. Overall: excellent in the style.",4.62
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier,"Poured from a 500mL glass bottle to my Weihenstephaner hefe glass, just about a finger and a half of dense foamy, uneven head appears. Cloudy orange with a tinge of yellow.

Strong bubblegum aroma hits me first, followed by banana. Gentle spices, of which clove is the most noticeable. Wheaty and gentle yeast ester smell, maybe the palest or grassy funk.

Of all the hefe’s, I have always found Weihenstephaner to be strongest on the bubblegum and banana, which it does not disappoint on the palate here. Of the sweet malt it is crackery like wheat dominated, rather than the doughy malt of Belgians. Great cereal grain taste on the finish. Cloves and mild white peppery like spices wane in and out. A bit of mint was apparent as well.

Light-medium bodied, medium carbonation of the effervescent kind, tight small bubbles create a mild prickliness on the top of your tongue and a semi foamy sip. A gentle finish, not dry nor wet, which leaves an essence of banana bread and grains on the tongue.

Two things here: firstly, I don’t think my bottle was the freshest. I am going to revisit this review down the line and do a side by side comparison. Secondly, Weihenstephaner is and always will be the first beer that got me into drinking good beer, foreign beer, and craft. Once I had it, I never looked back. It was not my gold standard for Hefeweizens, but beer in general. As stated, I have my own Weihenstephaner glass I drink all my wheat beers out of.

That said… I think in the years that have passed, I can’t really rank it as a 98 like it is on BA. It’s legendary with a strong backing, but in modern times I’ve had too many wheat beers that were so complex and just as good, I think the beer coasts just a little off of its legendary reputation. Keeping in mind, I do believe the beer is the standard bearer/gold standard of the style. It’s the absolute most classic, straight up example of the excellency of wheat beers. For most of its existence it might as well have been Zeus compared to all other beers. In modern times, however, many others have climbed Mt Olympus and taken their place beside it. I say all this despite unending nostalgia for the beer and being it’s biggest lover for well over a decade and a half. This is still a phenomenal beer, best of the old guard. I look forward to revisiting the review with the freshest bottle I can find!",4.17
Jai Alai IPA,"This is one of the best IPA's I ever had, ranks close to Pliny the Elder. Extremely crisp taste with hints of grapefruit and other citrus flavors. Great after a 10K run.",4.75
Jai Alai IPA,"330ml can served in a pint glass.

A: Pours a clear orange color forming a big and bubbled and fluffy beige head. Great retention and tons of lingering lacings formed and left in the glass

S: Crispy and biscuity upfront. Strong notes of caramel malts. Delicious hops profile: Citric, grassy and piney. Fruity too, with strong notes of grapefruit and passion fruit. Bit boozy and earthy finish

T: Caramel upfront followed by a crispy, dry and biscuity sensation. Caramel malts. Fruity notes: grapefruit, melon and passion fruit, mainly. Lingering grassy bitterness. Great bittersweet balance. Good bitterness retention.

M: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Bitter afertaste: Biscuity and piney

O: Very drinkable. Masterpiece IPA",4.46
Jai Alai IPA,"To my sophisticated palate, this IPA, out of all of them, plays the balance between ""east coast"" and ""west coast"" styles perfectly. It's got that citrus, tropical juiciness of the east yet all of the piney, resinous character of the left coast. I especially enjoy it in the 19.2 oz taller boy can.",4.25
Jai Alai IPA,"Available almost everywhere in the US, this take on a classic American IPA is just Great. Pair it up with whatever you’re doing, whatever you’re eating. Dress it up or slosh it down.
Balanced, little bitta, hoppy, good head retention, it’s a happy IPA that’s priced right.
We have a Winner, Folks!",4.4
Jai Alai IPA,"As most have stated, this is the standard for juicy IPAs. They just hit the nail on the head with the balance of juice, pine, bite. Beautiful golden copper color. Strong but not overwhelming ABV. One of my top 4 IPAs (Space Dust, Scofflaw Basement, Wicked Weed Freak of Nature).",4.61
Jai Alai IPA,"When poured from tap. A 1/4 inch head.
Amber color Slight hop aroma.
Smooth over the taste buds with a slight hop after taste.
A very good summer beer !!",4.92
Jai Alai IPA,"I have nothing to add to the hundreds of other glowing reviews already posted. This is a consistently excellent IPA, and furthermore it's always one of the least expensive in any beer store cooler. Well done on all counts. A solid ""A"".",4.62
Jai Alai IPA,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours orange red with a fluffy slightly off white head. Smells of citrus and piney hops. Tastes of citrus and piney hops, nice and full. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",4.12
Jai Alai IPA,"Jai Alai is one of my go to beers. It's easy to find down here in Florida & I really appreciate that. Wonderful tropical smell.
Taste is citrus, orange, nice hop kick, pine spice and sweet caramel malt to balance it out. Great brew!",4.4
Jai Alai IPA,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Slightly hazy pale amber color with a foamy white head that receded to a thin film but left some rings of lace. Strong citrus and hop resin aroma. Taste follows, a citrus smorgasbord with some smooth malt to round it out in a very flavorful but not overwhelming IPA. Medium-full bodied and very drinkable despite the 7.5% ABV. An excellent IPA.",4.22
Jai Alai IPA,"L: Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pint glass. Two fingers of smooth ivory head that slowly dissipates to a thin cap. Lots of soapy lacing on the glass while sipping. The beer itself is a medium amber.

S: the aroma is a mix of tropical fruit an resins darkness.

T: The flavor is redolent with tropical citrus with a solid caramel malt backbone. No particular flavor dominates the palate, but it's all there.

T: Smooth on the tongue, with velvety creaminess. No alcohol burn.

O: This is a fine IPA with excellent flavor and body, well made and worth a couple more cans.",4.21
Jai Alai IPA,"As a native Floridian, don’t let my bias skew anyone from how fantastic this easy drinking IPA is in the summer sun. Combined with how widely available it is on tap throughout central Florida, this Jai Lai is hard to top.",4.3
Centennial IPA,"Looks hazy copperish in color. Smells hoppy with a mix of other scents including, blueberry, lemon, evergreen/pine, raspberry, and dill. Something in the smell reminds me of deli style dill pickles. Taste is lemon and grapefruit, hops and pine. While not over bitter, the bitterness does have a long finish. A fine beer.",3.18
Centennial IPA,"Poured from a 12oz bottle (bottled 3/30/22), into a pint glass. A hazy copper color with a 2 finger high off white head with visible carbonation that left lots of lacing. A strong hop presence to the nose with an earthy maltiness below. Bitterness in flavor from start to finish with the malts also well represented, very well balanced. Mouth is a wee bit syrupy and medium to full bodied. A fine go to when undecided about what to have.",4.23
Centennial IPA,"I think this is my favorite IPA out of dozens of others that I've tried. I absolutely love the piney smell and taste of centennial hops. This IPA has a perfect malt balance to the ABV percentage and leaves a slight stickiness on your lips. There is nothing wrong with this beer and I've only had this beer out of a 19.2 fluid ounce can and is only sold as singles in only one liquor store out of the 3 we have here in Uvalde, Tx. and all 3 of them suck bad compared to liquor stores in much larger cities but I sure would like to try this beer out of a bottle. Cans tend to effect the flavor of any beverage. Anyway that's my take on this IPA because in my book it's a masterpiece and hats off to the brewers that put it together and made it happen. I read a few really negative reviews that I don't understand but it's possible they picked up some that have gotten hot and then cooled off no telling how many times. I think they should give it a second chance and change their reviews accordingly to their 2nd experience with it. It deserves a higher overall rating than it does for a beer with it's amount of character. I hope this beer never disappears. Hope my review helps others that are looking to try something new and enjoyable in the IPA realm of the craft beer world because this one might just make you cream in your jeans. Be careful!",4.99
Centennial IPA,From a tallboy can. Amber color with an inch or so of fluffy beige head. Smells of pine. Medium body and sticky feel. Roasted malt and piney hops. Nicely balanced.,4.17
Centennial IPA,"Another back of the cooler find at the local beer store. Parts of the labels are torn and smudged but the price was right at one dollar. Took a chance and I think I lucked out.

Poured into a clear glass and it produced a reddish-brown color with a tan-like head. The smell was of hops and possibly a pine. The taste is a pleasant hop bitterness. All in all, it was a good decision.",3.92
Centennial IPA,"Bought a 15-apck cans $15.99 Target
82 days old
Smell of citrus, pine
Hazy reddish-amber color
Medium mouthfeel
Medium carbonation
Taste of malt, grapefruit, oranges, some bitterness, alcohol aftertaste. Seems a little thin in the middle.
Overall ok. Not bad for the price.",3.55
Centennial IPA,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a stemmed glass. Light copper in color, slightly cloudy, and one-finger head with moderate lacing.

Smell - a healthy balance of grassy hops and malts, with some honey-like sweet undertones.

Taste - malty sweetness to start, then a rush of floral/grassy hoppy notes accompanied by light to moderate bitterness. the balance is delicate: nothing particularly stands out, but nothing is subdued. finish is slightly sweet with just a tad bit of warmness.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderately boozy at 7.2% ABV.

Overall - an old school American IPA, with excellent balance between malts and hops that gets the best of both worlds.",3.92
Centennial IPA,"My favorite beer! Have always enjoyed bitter, and this beer has it in spades (65 IBU), but it's not too much. Has replaced Saranac Legacy, another very good IPA, as my favorite; Founder's Centennial is now my go to. Has a strong level of alcohol (7.2%) without being too strong. Beautiful copper color, great head, smell, taste, and feel. Also, readily available in my area (upstate NY) at reasonable prices. What's not to love?",4.58
Centennial IPA,"Very full flavored ipa. Rich Ale flavors. Not sure how to describe it other than a warm flavor, which is excellent. It’s extremely refreshing and has top tier flavor.",4.55
Centennial IPA,"Mix between a two hearted ale and an all day ipa. Starts with a floral malty sweetness with a hint of pine, malty mellow middle, finishes with a floral piney bittersweet finish. Excellent and I’m not usually big on IPAs.",4.39
Centennial IPA,Liked it overall but this beer fizzes out every time when I open the can no matter what the temperature of the beer. Have to put the mug in the sink and open it over it. Still manage to lost beer as it basically explodes into the glass. No wonder it came in a 15 pack because by the time I’m done it will have really only been a 12er due to the foamed up lost beer.,4.26
Centennial IPA,"Featuring one of my favorite hops varietals, this rich amber drink offers a crisp, slightly sour bite at the front, that settles into an earthy straw-like exhale...the later more pronounced as it warms. Just enough bread on the bottom to balance this act with magnificence. A King's drink, indeed.",4.5
Centennial IPA,"I love this beer. i play the field, but always come home to this. A lovely clear copper color, fruity but not overwhelming smell, a bit of the oily texture that an IPA should have, and a perfect balance between malt and hops. And it certainly doesn't hurt that it's widely available in my area and quite inexpensive (15 12-ounce cans for about $18).",4.84
Centennial IPA,"This beer looks nice and smells nice when pouring, but has a bitter taste on first sip and the aftertaste is even more bitter. It is one of the least enjoyable IPA's I've had. The taste is what I describe as a ""burnt"" hop taste. Old and bitter and sour. If you really enjoy a bitter and sour IPA, this one is for you. Not for me.",3.41
Centennial IPA,"Pours a hazy copper with an eggshell colored head that leaves gobs of lacing behind. Huge aroma of pine, grapefruit and citrus. Flavors follow, with smome malty sweetness, medium bodied, great carbonation. This is a beer I always keep in the fridge.",4.38
Backwoods Bastard,"Haven't had this in a while - and never rated it.

Very beautiful pour - nice brown caramel color and a bit of head.
No noticeable smell.
Very delicious. Creamy. Smooth mouthfeel. Not too much sweetness.

Excellent beer.",4.38
Backwoods Bastard,"12 oz bottle into a Founders snifter. Top popped and everything seemed to leap out!
Immediate Scotch aroma fills the space. Lively fizz that lays down quickly.
Taste is Scotch & soda, caramel sweetness, barrel dryness, quick finish.
Feel is old ale heft, low to medium carb.
Overall, supurb sipper.,.",4.24
Backwoods Bastard,"Pours a dark brownish color with a small tan colored head that didn't last long. The smell was of malt, caramel and a strong alcohol. The taste was that of malt with some caramel and the influence of the scotch barrels for a warm alcohol finish. A really good beer.",4.41
Backwoods Bastard,"Super hardcore and outrageous scotch and oak barrels combine nicely with the base scotch ale. It’s oaky, a bit roasty, with caramel sweetness, some tobacco and dark fruit. Bombastic but nice.",4.25
Backwoods Bastard,"Poured from 12oz bottle into Chimay goblet.

L - Dark brown pour, with a light cream colored foam.

S - Vanilla, caramel, barrel.

T - Caramel, malt, vanilla, peat, black coffee. Starts sweet and works its way into a nice smooth bitterness.

F - Not heavy, but has a nice weight on the tongue. Creamy and dry at the same time.

The barrel cures the weak points of the original Dirty Bastard and turns it into an outstanding Wee Heavy.",4.36
Backwoods Bastard,"I tried this brew a couple of years ago and remembered that I really liked. Today is the first time I have seen it back in stock at my local beer store so of course I had to try it again. I'm a fan of dark bourbon beers and this one ranks right up at the top. The initial pour unveils a dark amber ale with a short lived frothy head. The smell is sweet with an obvious bourbon scent. The first taste is remarkably smooth and rich, sweetness on the tongue with a mild pleasant bitterness arriving at the end which left me craving for my next sip. Ahhhhh, so yummy! This is a first class sipping beer that you should keep on hand for your favorite house guests...if your the generous type.",4.97
Backwoods Bastard,"Bottled on 09.27.21 - 2nd try on this one, which drives this very review - found the barrel taste too strong & fresh-coopered first time, but impressions seem to be diminished this round...)

Pour into 5oz snifter leaves an appealing bubbly tan head reducing to cloudy mists on the surface with a bubbly creamy little ring surrounding the fill line. Color such a lovely translucent deep burgundy. Nose is barrel woods, sweet molasses, perhaps a nuance of tangy fruitiness in there too. Taste is a lovely bittersweet, a little tang & fizz on the tongue. Swallow is bittersweet, not overly sticky.

I can see why appreciators like aging this one. It's a sweet lil' treat.",4.48
Backwoods Bastard,"Fairly dark body, browinish burnt copper color with a decent light tan head. Very pretty aroma: caramel, vanilla & bourbon. Sweet with just of hint of bitter. Very tasty: caramel, brown sugar, spices, bourbon, scotch, ripe dark fruit, vanilla & oak barrel flavors. Medium feel, good carbonation & a fair amount of alcohol heat in the mouth & stomach. Excellent scotch ale.",4.49
Backwoods Bastard,"This sample was bottled 9/28/12. Poured into a 16oz nonic, a tan off white head forms and quickly dissipates leaving a light cap of foam on top. The color is a slightly translucent reddish brown. The smell is of boozy roasted malts, bourbon and candied dried fruit. The taste is slightly sweet, boozy malt, with notes of dried fruit and bourbon. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly slick. Given the age of my sample I assume the carbonation has toned down from the original packaging, the mouthfeel is smooth. Overall, this is an excellent beer that I would definitely buy again.",4.51
Backwoods Bastard,"When compared to KBS it is a step lower. BUT - that does not make it undesirable. If you are a connoisseur of ales you will love it. If not - the pilsner people and BudNiks will notice the bloaty feeling and over-handed sweetness and put it down around a stale Oh Henry. Newbies will be hypnotized - the Seasoned will say ""meh.""",4.23
Backwoods Bastard,"This is a fantastic dark beer, especially considering you don't have to go to a boutique micro-brew in order to get it. It's available at my local grocery store! The flavors are complex without feeling artificial or over-powering. The bourbon barrel aging is evident. It forms a very nice, almost nitro-style head. IMHO, this is the best offering Founders puts out...which is saying a lot since they make some outstanding beers.",4.65
Backwoods Bastard,"11/7/21 from a 12 oz bottle 4 pack.... Birthday present from DW.

T: oak, bourbon, smoke, nuts, dried up fruit, figs, raisins, pectin, fruit cake, pecan pie. Not too sweet.
F: medium bodied and kind of sticky. Balanced and fairly smooth.
O: Deep, full flavored barrel beer with a hearty soul. There is light alcohol. It is excellent.",4.28
Nugget Nectar,Wow! Drank this one ice cold and right out of the can. When I opened it the beer was filled right up to the top and sort of just overflowed a bit. The smell was hops and hops and exactly what I like. The taste was definitely of a hoppy nature and the ABV just adds to the enjoyment. I will positively be looking for more when I can.,4.41
Nugget Nectar,"Finally had several of these sent from some NJ family so I can try this top-notch-hyped imperial red. I could never catch it available when visiting. Pours a deep and clear golden color with a modest head.
Nose is like sweet cakey/ candies malts and hops all together, makes me want to taste.
The flavor goes there, it’s so much flavor up front with sweet caramel and tasty hops, just a well-balanced impeccable red IPA. Resin/ earthiness is a defining characteristic, and it’s tasty. Tingly fresh hop bitterness lives in this beer. It ends superbly. Amazing balance.
Feels perfect. Smooth and smooth, then smooth. Slight stickiness, vanishes superbly and I’m ready for more.
I can see why this gets the love.
It’s like a Hop Wallop meets a red ale, masterfully and silky.",4.5
Nugget Nectar,"Pours a nearly clear mahogany color with a small foamy white head and a moderate amount of lacing.

Smells of piney, grassy hops and malt.

Tastes of mildly bitter, peppery hops throughout with smaller tastes malt, caramel and pineapple.

Medium body with light carbonation. Smooth dry mouthfeel.

This beer is an enjoyable mash up of a Wee Heavy and a West Coast IPA. Scotch IPA?",4.25
Nugget Nectar,"One of those beers I drink plenty of and then surprised that I haven't rated it yet. So anyway, an attractive appearance; clear copper, nice size head, good lacing. Aroma is equally appealing, earthy and herbal with subtle notes of citrus. Resinous quality on the palate along with the herbal influence. Finishes a bit spicy. Bitterness adds depth and balance. Best by date of 5/11/22",4.35
Nugget Nectar,Beautiful pour with one finger foam. Smell is pine and malt. The taste is very much on the edge of IPA…..almost too close. I don’t have much experience with this style but if you told me it was an IPA I wouldn’t bat an eye. Keep that in mind before you try …. This is hoppier than your average Red.,3.69
Nugget Nectar,"Poured a very pleasing amber color with active carbonation and a manila folder (Google it if you've never seen one) colored head that left plenty of lacing.
Aroma, even to my chemical damaged nose, was very nice. Obvious malts and hops play parts in the dance; I can't say I got the ""pine, resin and mango"" that the can states are prominent but it is very pleasant.
The taste, found it hard not to think of this as an IPA, it's just on that cusp. Likely the hoppiest red ale I've ever had, but that's not a bad thing at all; it's delicious!
The feel falters only in that it's way to drinkable for it's ABV. I could quaff this down by the liter if given the opportunity.
OA, Seriously good beer, all the way around. The denizens of Hershey, PA are fortunate to have this on tap.",4.44
Nugget Nectar,"Clear and bright body, medium amber colored; excellent carbonation, fine bubbles and gently rising; huge, white head, sculpted and densely creamy. Strong scent of pine resin offset with gentle caramel notes. Outstanding taste, well-balanced and complex; light malt base with a moderate to bold hop bitterness; some peppery spiciness. Medium-heavy body; softly abrasive; light sweetness countered with a moderate overall dryness.

A most extraordinary ale, well-crafted and bursting with balance, flavor, and immensely pleasurable appearance.

Pouring temperature: 45 °F; canning data: FRESHEST BY 05/11/2022",4.29

Hard to stop pouring this beer and at 7.5 …. My current fav!",4.83
Nugget Nectar,"Can into pint glass; freshest by 4/28/2022.

L: Orangey-copper, crystal clear, with a substantial head and good retention/lacing. I hate to drink it because it looks so nice.
S: Mostly hop bitterness, a few citrus notes.
T: Just nailed-on balance between the malt and hops, slightly resinous finish
F: Very smooth, a little sticky.
O: Worth the hype, the highlight of the Tröegs lineup for me. Almost by itself makes PA winter tolerable.",4.27
Nugget Nectar,"I suppose I'll contradict myself and say that I'm not overly enthusiastic about beers with ramped up ABV scores. Too often, I find that the pleasure of the mouthfeel is compromised when the main thing you taste is the octane. With that said, I'm always impressed by beers that are a little stronger but bring the complex flavor into the foreground. Seems like that's the kind of thing ""craft"" is all about. I do love the Tröegs company and their creativity and sensibility, but I don't love all their beers (which is no knock on them at all). But for my money, Nugget Nectar is some of their finest work. It's such a pleasurable beer to drink; flavorful with a kind of well-earned sweetness, beautiful balance of the different hop notes and malt, and a stunning color in the glass. Over the years, I've cycled through a number of Tröegs beers, giving many a try, but I'm finally prepared to say that this is my favorite of all I've tried. This is the one I wait for every year and buy whenever it comes to my beer store.",4.31
Nugget Nectar,"L: Copper brown very slightly hazy, good 2-3 finger head

S: Malt but balances with the hops, slightly sweet

T: I get some pretty good hops for an ale, malt, and slightly sour resiny taste

F: Medium-bodied, easy going down, clean finish, moderate mouthfeel

O: A very solid, delicious beer. If would have tasted this blind I would have called it an IPA and while I have not had a lot of red ales this one is excellent. Available only 1x per year around the holidays, lucky I live only about an hour away from the brewery. Troegs hit this one on the head.",4.24
Nugget Nectar,"Nugget Nectar is pretty much everything I want....sweet, malty, fruity, bitey, and hoppy. It is hands down, one of my favorite beers. Delish, every time. Troegs knows what's up.",4.5
Nugget Nectar,"L: Pours a clear copper with a 2 finger white head. Good retention.

S: Balanced with piney hops and sweet malt

T: Caramel malt, honey, piney hops, resin. Very balanced.

F: Medium bodied, easy to drink, clean finish

O: This is a solid beer. Not a style I’m super familiar with but no detectable faults.",4.19
Nugget Nectar,This beer is really good. Although I would not suggest it for those who just started craft beer drinking. It has nothing in it that would wow a non craft beer drinker. But It has everything a craft beer lover would love in a beer. However the appearance isn’t anything to write about. But I guess that’s ok.,4.94
Nugget Nectar,"12 oz. can, freshest by 4/19/2022. Cream colored foam on a reddish copper body. The aroma is bit weak on this batch but what is there is indicative of the flavor, which is florid, hoppy, and mildly bitter. The red ale aspect is evident in the creamy feel of the body. A wonderful beer for these cold winter nights.",4.23
Nugget Nectar,"Nugget Nectar Ale has a thick, spongy, ivory head and a clear, bubbly orange appearance, with heavy lacing. The aroma is of dark bread crust and hop resins. It has a similar flavor, with building bitterness. Nugget Nectar Ale has a medium body and a dry finish.

RJT",4.75
Nugget Nectar,"Really solid beer. Drinks enough like an IPA to please a hop head, smooth enough to please most pils lovers, and diverse in profile enough to please most sour seekers. I think it's just a really well-crafted beer. A lot of love was put into making this gem.",4.33
120 Minute IPA,"This review is for the 2022 release.

Best beer I have tried in a long, long time. Absolutely fantastic.

So much flavor but not overpowering, wonderfully balanced. Hard to believe it's over 16%",5.0

120 Minute IPA,"Been wanting to try this beer out for a long time now and finally came across it at a local liquor store that sells a wide range of craft beers from all over. The store owner said that he was sent two cases of it. So anyway, I pay $40 (!) for a 4-pack and rush home to put a bottle in the freezer… First off, it looks fantastic. Pours a deep copper color with good lacing on the glass. The smell was a little surprising though; seemed very malt-forward, like a good beer that had sat in an unconditioned garage for a couple of years and the hops had been burned out of it (yes, I’m familiar with such scenarios; when you have wildly varying temperature changes of 20 degrees in the winter and 110 in the summer, that ugliness can play havoc on an unprotected beer. Welcome to NW Florida). The taste was unexpected as well. I thought some serious hop action was on the way but said hops seemed nonexistent. I typically don’t care for hop heavy beers but hey, a balance would be nice. And strong? Yeah, you could say that. You can almost feel the alcoholic vapor rising up out of your chest. I couldn’t find an ABV anywhere, although BA says it’s in the 18-20% range and that seems about right. So bottom line, this is a serious beer that demands attention. Is it all that I expected? Not so much. A good barley wine maybe. Don’t get me wrong, I like this brew, but I guess the hype just left me wanting a little bit more. Still, I feel comfortable giving it a solid 4 out of 5.",3.7
120 Minute IPA,"My father in law gave me a $50 bill to spend on some fancy beer, so this is what I chose. I saw the 4 pack sitting on the shelf for $42 and knew right away that's how I'd spend the money. I've had the 60 minute and 90 minute as everyday drinkers at my local bars on Saturday nights out, but never thought too much about them. But I knew given this beer's reputation I had to try it eventually. Poured out pure gold, richly golden, glowing with a copper luminescence, but it's murky and dense, and cannot be seen through. A beautiful white head formed that dissipated into a mess of mismatched bubbles around the rim of the glass. The smell is all orange and lemon zest, perhaps some grapefruit in there too. No alcohol on the nose. The taste is richly citrus and a full strong wash of hops, bittering and balancing the sweetness of the fruits. Hints of grass and wheat, and a golden touch of honey complete the sphere of flavor. The beer bounces around in my mouth in a lively brew of bubbles, and is quite thin and watery that goes down quickly and easily. I cannot detect the astoundingly high ABV that is present in this beer. This tastes rich and full, but not any more strong than what i remember the 90 minute to be. Overall, this is quite refreshing and lively, thirst quenching and smile inducing. It's not particularly unique, but i don't think it has to be to earn higher marks from me. I'm in Florida and in this heat this is the perfect summertime brew and I'm glad I'm drinking it on vacation. I noticed several reviewers are comparing this to a barleywine, and I would agree on that point. Two thumbs up.",4.57
120 Minute IPA,"This is the most satisfying, delicious, and outstanding DIPA I have ever had the pleasure of consuming! Words are unable to describe the blast of flavor. Clocking in at 16% ABV and 120 IBU, the absolute highest, this brew will not disappoint!",5.0
120 Minute IPA,"Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA, 15-20% ABV. Pours clear copper with a two-finger off-white head that left prolific lacing. Nose is sweet toffee/caramel. Taste follows, more sweet than bitter, and boozy. Decent mouthfeel, lightly dry, decent carbonation. Overall outstanding. This will knock you on your ass.",4.4
120 Minute IPA,"Beautiful copper hue, clear and an attempt at a head.settle for a bubble ring
Notes of caramel and burnt sugar,
Butterscotch and caramel, like some cognac qualities hop bitterness as well.
Medium feel, liqueur booziness feel.

120 Minute IPA,"Better categorized as a Barleywine - this potent potable is strong, sweet and bold. Not for a casual drink, the 15-20% abv asserts itself more quickly than this guy is used to experiencing. Tastes sweet, with an excellent mouth feel.",4.44
120 Minute IPA,"2022 Bottle poured into a Founders Brewing Co snifter

A: Pours golden copper amber with a frothy cream white head that settles to a light layer and leaves a little thin lacing.

S: Sweet bready malt, big honey, citrus, floral notes, dark and stone fruit, some spice, resinous pine, and a bit of alcohol that gets stronger as it warms.

T: Candied citrus, orange marmalade, lemon, and grapefruit, resinous pine, spice, underlying fruity notes, apricot, peach, fig, white grape, and golden raisin, bready malt, brown sugar and honey sweetness, and a little alcohol.

M: Full body, moderate carbonation, slightly syrupy, definitely a little alcohol warmth, though it's pretty well managed and never really gets unpleasant or overwhelming.

O: Another beer I know I've had before, but never logged, so here we go with a fresh bottle to establish a baseline before cracking into a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it's an absolute behemoth. The 2022 edition sits at 16.6%, so not the full 18-20% of old, but still plenty big. There is a hop presence so there's no denying it's an IPA, but there's also a ton of sweet malt there as is required to hit that ABV. Well made and fun to try fresh to say you've had it (Go for a short pour or share a bottle with a buddy), but if you're after a big and hoppy experience, stick to DIPAs and TIPAs. (4.04)",4.04
120 Minute IPA,"2019 bottle.

Pours a cloudy, semi-opaque dark brown color. Thin off-white head forms and dissipates quickly leaving just a thin layer of foam.

Aroma has notes of old piney hops, light maple sugar notes, some rich malty notes and some mild raisin or date fruit notes.

Taste follows the nose with a blast of rich malts, strong piney hops, with some notes of raisins, dates, caramel, molasses, maple syrup, Even at 4 years old - this is still extremely hot. it warms up the pit of your stomach as you sip on it.

Feel is thick, syrupy, warming and smooth. Moderate carbonation. Semi-dry, trending dry on the finish.

Overall this is a unique beer that is a must try, even if it is not one to drink often. To me, its essentially an American Barleywine - but a really well done one.",4.17
120 Minute IPA,"Drank way too much of this when on tap locally, outstanding compared to any bottled version previously. This is no light beer by any stretch. Impressively concocted, but there's just a ton of both malt and hop. Fun to try.",4.18
120 Minute IPA,"Tell you a story.,. I used to have keg parties in my backyard long ago and far away. Live music, BBQ, tackle basketball, etc.
It would get to about 10 PM and everybody was feeling right. Then my friend Daniel would show up with a jug of Wild Turkey and everything went to shit.
So nowadays, I be sitting with my beer buds (or beer and buds as it were, having lain down liquor 16 years ago) and long about 10:00, I’ll whip out a couple of 120’s and split ‘em up in tasters, pass ‘em around. Cheers!
Everybody gets goosebumps, cheeks turn red, and they make ‘that face’. (I truly mean that in the most complimentary way.)

120 Minute IPA is an Extreme Novelty that always satisfies. Sweet and hoppy, boozy and offputting, lowbrow and dispicable - yet the most underrated beer in America.
It’s a nipple pinch - whether you like it or not, you know you got pinched.
Can you dig that?",4.56
Guinness Draught,From tap at irish pub in Nördlingen in Germany. Smells like Caramel Coffee. Perfectly balanced taste. Drinks like water. Carbonation makes for a very creamy amazing mouthfeel. From tap is significantly better than Guinness from a can.,4.34

Guinness Draught,"The legendary Guinness Draught; What a fantastic debut beer review.

Third beer of the day; one Belgian white and a Guinness. I will never review a beer if it's the first of the day.

Cool 16oz glass. I cracked the burnished gold tab and let the nitrogen/co2 slowly hiss out.

After pouring, there's a bit of fireworks in the glass, let them play it up. 100% fantastic head, moist as the freshest bread. Surface tension keeps it from bubbling over the glass edge, even as it rises above. The perfect pour every time.

Time for the first sip; Not my first rodeo with Guinness, I dive right in. Caramelly toast waft as this signature black beer cuts through the soft foamy head. Great mouthfeel as the cold rush of stout emulsifies with the head. Sweet chocolate and bitter malt on the tongue. As smooth as nice whisky. The first sip of Guinness is one of the best, 5/5.

Midway there's a bit of Irish bog to traverse, as while this isn't the thickest stout it's vast and muddy nonetheless. But the nice chocolaty bread really shines through even as it warms.

The last few sips are a bitter-tooth brew eater's paradise. As I finish the beer, residual head and newly sloshed foam splatter the glass artfully. The taste of malt on the last sip radiates out to fill your nose up playfully. Even with its mild 4.2% ABV, the bitterness gives me a bit of a woozy headspace.

As I grab another Guinness to fill my empty glass, I note the almost cakelike foam at the bottom. Scrumptiously bitter, yet may negate that aforementioned surface tension. Gotta get a fresh glass!",4.56
Imperial Russian Stout,"2014 Vintage
22oz bottle poured into a snifter

A- pours jet black in color with a one-finger creamy khaki colored head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind

S- smoky charred malt, black licorice, dark chocolate, figs, raisins, molasses, coffee and caramel

T- intense charred malt up front gives notes of anise, burnt toast and dark roast coffee. Mid-palate gives some dark fruit notes of raisin, fig and prune, along with dark chocolate. The finish gives more charred malt

M- medium/heavy body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety, slightly warming finish

O- a standard bearer of the style, and one that ages with the best of them",4.38
Imperial Russian Stout,"2014 Vintage dated opened in 2021. It pours a stygian dark brown with a modest light brown head that soon diminishes to nothing.

Imperial Russian Stout,Pitch black. A small amount of head appeared. Sweet smell of dates/ fruity. Can taste molasses. Notice the strong alcohol taste. Not a very sticky feel.,3.43
Imperial Russian Stout,"This is a 22oz bottle of the '2014 RELEASE'. Label displays 11%ABV.
Nearly opaque black colored body, with the thinnest of bottom edge showing dark brown back lit highlights. Two finger tan creamy head, which recedes to thin cap and ring. Leaves behind some rings of lacing.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, black licorice, and dark fruits.
Taste is dark roasted malts, which express dark chocolate and dark roast coffee. The dark fruit shows up close to the end. The black licorice is a minor note throughout.
Full mouth feel, super creamy. Good carbonation.
The alcohol is there but not super strong. This beer is good for sipping but is really quaffable for such a higher ABV%. Excellent overall and great that it needs no adjuncts to bring forth complex smells and flavors. It's a loss that this is no longer brewed.

Bottle Notes:
Brewed in the authentic, historical style of an imperial Russian stout, this beer is massive. Intensely aromatic (notes of anise, black currants, coffee, roastiness and alcohol) and heavy on the palate, this brew goes where few can - and fewer dare even try. The style originated from Czarist Russia's demand for ever-thicker English stouts. Expect our version of this mysterious brew to pour like Siberian crude and taste even heavier!",4.43
Imperial Russian Stout,"Bottled in March 2016. Black in color. Poured with a moderate, creamy, espresso tan foam with medium low retention. Rich, dark roasted and grainy malt aromas with dark chocolate and earthy, tobacco-like notes and light booziness. Rich and full bodied with medium light carbonation and a velvety smooth feel. Pleasant boozy warmth from the middle to the end. Roasted malt flavors up front with notes of dark chocolate and charred grainy malt. Medium earthy hop bitterness through the middle followed by chocolate and dark malt flavors. Bitterness transitions to warming booziness to the end. Finished semi-dryly with bitter dark chocolate and roasted maltiness with a light boozy heat. Great aromas and rich flavors with a fabulous feel and pleasant warmth.",4.24
Imperial Russian Stout,"2015 version - bottled 03/05/15, so just short of 4 years. Pours a thick black with brown head, reddish highlights. Smell is sweet roasty coffee, bit of dark fruits, licorice, and faintly chocolate. Tastes more of the dark chocolate but still with coffee, hints of the licorice, a bit oaky. Smooth rich mouthfeel - notes of the booze - but a bit of that lingering coffee bitterness at the finish. Warm and inviting of another sip.",4.17
Duvel,"L - Poured from a standard bottle into a large wine glass. Huge head on mild pour. Light golden clear color. Head slowly dissipates to thick suds with mild lacing, and then to a healthy film that stays through the beer.

S - Light fruit and sweet scents up front. Some apple and possible citrus. A pleasant sweet yeast scent appears part way through drinking. Some more earthy tones are noticed as well.

T - Taste follows scent with sweet fruits like apple, pear, and mild citrus., but adds some spice in there. Some muted floral notes appear as you drink. Not bitter though. More of a sweet yeast flavor as you drink. And then some more earthy flavors come out as well as it warms up. Agitation brings back the sweet fruit characteristics, but definite sweet yeast as the main flavor. Somewhat boozy toward the end.

F - What a smooth mouthfeel at first. A healthy amount of carbonation stays as you drink it. Top notch.

O - Overall, this was a fantastic and enjoyable beer. I had casually avoided Duvel assuming it was a generic European macrobrew. I was wrong and this beer is a treat. I will definitely add it to my regular rotation.",4.56
Duvel,"Gifted from a friend and couldnt wait to indulge but took about 10 minutes to pour, so I waited. Beautiful look pillowy head, golden color, slight aroma, bready, taste of clove, banana spice, prickly mouthfeel, hoppy but balanced - worth the wait, good beer",4.51
Duvel,"Great beer and a reliable go-to for so many situations. Light golden pour with great carbonation and a huge, lasting white head. Spice, bread, and fruit, with a mix of white grape, apple, and pear. Very effervescent and a nice, dry finish. Fantastic. Never disappoints.",4.89
Duvel,"Pours a beautiful, clear pale golden-straw colour. Three finger thick white creamy head slowly compacts into a one finger, dense foam that lasts the rest of the beer.

Interesting and subtly complex aroma, slightly sour aromas of gentle funkiness. Earthy, more like damp leaves and wood than a horse barn kind of funk. Yeasty esters play around with a slight bitter, floral and grassy hop smell. Subtle banana and cloves, typical of most Belgians. I might have an older bottle, but I swear there is a vinous, grapey smell as well on a deep inhale. A tiny bit of bready, toasty malt, but I find it takes a backseat to the sour viney damp smells.

Taste is very subtly complex as well, very pale and gentle sourness on the tip. Earthy and moist like wheaty aromas. Some subtle yeast notes with the malt. There is a savouriness as well here. I’ll mention again I think my bottle is older, which has brought out some nifty aromas and I think tempered the flavours a bit and evened them out. Some bitter citrus peel is noticeable as well, and a pleasant bitterness on the finish that is semi-sweet, a bit viney, with a white grape like taste.

I didn’t notice the alcohol as much as others. This is a light-medium bodied beer with good, medium level carbonation. Nice bittersweet, grapey and bready finish that is mostly dry.

Pleasant, complex, and easy drinking. I’d love to try a bottle that is super fresh just to compare. I’ll leave the review like this for now and hopefully come back soon!",4.17
Duvel,"Pours a translucent lemon yellow with a healthy white head creamy/foamy. Smell is (wow) first impression is lemon, decaying autumn leaves, clove,almost a pine like scent,very earthy. Taste is spicy herbs,(clove) , hint of banana,some malty goodness. Feel is well carbonated,(think champagne) finishes dry and juicy, Overall this is not like any other Belgian beer. I had this many years ago in Brussels and it still tastes just as good. Really good-",4.55
Duvel,"Smells like a citrus and bread, maybe even a small bit of grassiness that is also in the flavor. Lots of carbonation. Taste has some bitterness in it but not bad, some small fruit smell and flavors along with malt and barley and breads. The alcohol is noticeable but not too noticeable, to me this is the perfect higher ABV taste, with bold flavors but not a whiskey taste. As you continue drinking it gets more and more enjoyable. Great beer. Not a note-able aftertaste. The feel is semi-heavy.",4.18
Duvel,"Smells sweet like honey as soon as I opened the bottle. A little banana as well. Tastes of banana and bubble gum. This beer is very carbonated and I feel it overpowered the taste. It is a good beer, glad I tried it but doubt I will ever buy it again due to price. I would love to try it on tap someday to see if it is less carbonated.",4.35
Duvel,"As a someone who was introduced to Belgian ales from Unibroue's interpretations, I was excited to find one of the staples in my local liquor store. I had a great experience with the Chimay range and was looking forward to this one.

Nose: Mild, semi sweet malt

In the Glass: Well foamed or formed head, rises quickly to show it's pale golden shine. Great looking beer.

Palate, Crisp, orange citrus, sharp bitterness that fades into a full body of well malted barley. Crisp and sharp but not bitter.

Finish: That sharp citrusy body fades into a mellow alcohol and malt flavour.
Overall I can see why people covet this Ale. Unlike Chimay and Unibroue's offerings you do taste the High ABV with this one, hence the 4/5 rating. Not perfect but a fantastic ale.",4.0
Bleue (Blue),"Just bought in a bottle from my new local supermarket in Paris, never had before, not sure what to expect...

Bottle looks pretty cheap. Not expecting much...

Dark, deep, lingering foam...more even more beautiful than Guinness.

Aroma is natural, deep and inviting. Though a little too carbon dioxidey (in case you are foreign, that is not a word, I just created it...)

Very flavoursome, smooth and highly drinkable, for 9%. Reminds me of Christmas, even though it is August. Bitter, citrussy, loving it. Most stouts and dark beers are much too choclatey and heavy...this is still light, despite the high alcohol content. Definitely going to be drinking more of this. Unfortunately not tonight as my supermarket closes in 8 minutes and I live on the 7th floor with no lift, typical hardcore parisian style.

In Paris I remember I went to a bar opposite my apartment, ordered one of these...drank it in about 5 minutes...ordered another and drank it in 5 minutes. And then ordered another. The bitch French (Senegalese) bar maid told me that I had already had 2 and that now I can only have water. WTF!? So I went to a different bar. In England you could order 10 in 1 hour and they would love you for it.

Very good feel, it really zings in your mouth and the bubbles themselves have flavour. But not as amazing feel as some West Coast IPA's from America. However because of the smoothness and high alcohol content...and I guess premium ingredients...the high from drinking a few of these is amazing. Dark beers always keep you in control, unlike lagers, pilsners and IPA's. I have no idea why this is, maybe it's chromatics.

This beer is pretty cheap in Paris, and the best I have had so far that they sell locally. Will have to be careful as it probably will not mix too well with my current 7th floor no lift parisian style.

I would add that this beer is variable in my experience...

Although for me many West Coast IPA's are better than this overall, if I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life, I would probably choose this one.",4.4
Bleue (Blue),"I'm reviewing a bottle from 2021. At the sight it shows a dark brown color. As soon as it is poured into the glass, a very compact and balanced foam is formed. The nose is not particularly articulated, perhaps notes of cherry and spices as well as a strong hint of alcohol stand out.
At the first sip all the sweet character of banana and chocolate comes out, which was a little covered on the nose and now is released. Overall, I was particularly struck by the strong and balanced flavor of this beer that I would approach very well with a tasting of cured meats and cheeses.
Overall rating 4.5.",4.31

F: Smooth, like velvet, with a slight alcohol burn. Full bodied, and strong.

O: A marvelous, and timeless classic. I need to get more and age it. It rank it with Trappiste Rochfort 10 and Samichlaus Classic. Top tier.",4.19
Bleue (Blue),"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Half finger tan head. Dark cola color. Minor lacing. Some alcohol legs.

S - Malty and boozy. Some dark fruits like an after dinner wine. Sweetness in there as well.

T - Sweet with some spices in there. The spices were unexpected, but a great extra taste. Bready / Biscuity Malt. No bitterness. Some booziness, but not over-alcohol tasting at 9% ABV. Each taste changes a bit. Keeps you coming back for more.

F - Good carbonation. Medium thickness on mouthfeel. Almost creamy with agitation to bring back the head.

O - I really like this. Drank it at the beginning of Spring, but would be a great Winter / Fall beer. I loved the surprising sweet and spicy taste. Will definitely add this to the annual rotation.",4.37
Bleue (Blue),This beer is a beautiful thing - a beautiful large head sitting atop a rich dark ale . With such a strong alcohol content it will certainly knock you out a bit but you wouldn't know it from the taste. Great fruity and caramel flavours - you can taste the history here. Not an every day drink but certainly good for a colder day of the week - especially if you have one of the wide Chimay glasses at home..,4.77
Bleue (Blue),"Pours an opaque, deep dark brown with a slightly off white head that slowly grows to be over five inches thick. Over the course of a few minutes it slowly recedes to a creamy looking millimetre cap on top. Lovely looking beer.

I honestly thought I smelled aromas before I unbottled it. Lots of the typical notes are here, doughy and yeasty malt flavours, backed by a general sweetness and mild booziness, rum raisin cake, a deliciously deep and sweet savoury note, maybe dark chocolate covered dried dark fruits? Spices abound, hard to pick them apart, but you can always expect cloves and just a hint of liquorice. It’s really something else

The taste? It absolutely follows the nose, but the way it does it is what makes this such an experience to drink. Aside from what you get on the aromas, I’ll point out the most notable flavours. Bubbly, creamy, and boozy up front. You get hints of rum soaked, moist raisin cake. Spices hit you soon after and meld seamlessly, cloves nutmeg and liquorice are notable here. Deliciously yeasty and toasty caramel malts can be tasted throughout the sip and become quite notable at the end, augmented by the spices and sweetness, sort of tastes like you just had toasted bread with butter and cinnamon. Some dark cherry notes here and caramelized banana. Likely due to the high abv% mixing with the fruity esters and the caramel malt flavour, but it makes for some unique and tasty flavours. Perhaps just the slightest hint of general hop bitterness throughout.

Long and complex finish, which is mostly dry and fairly sweet. I didn’t pick up much bitterness myself. More lively carbonation than you might expect, but the carbonation is quite fine. Creates a creamy sip on the way down and prickles at your tongue. ABV% is slightly more noticeable than some other high alcohol beers, but it’s still masked well and the way you feel it with the flavours/it adds to your taste perception is a plus, honestly.

Phenomenal beer, honestly. Mine was a few months old, would love to try an aged one. I think it helped bring the effervescence down slightly judging by how carbonated some other reviewers said theirs were. I only have one more in my cellar, and this is a beer I would love to try at all life stages. Super fresh, a few months old, year or two old, and a super old cellared grandpa! Or maybe it’s just indicative that I want to drink a lot of this. Highly recommend this for anyone who loves any Belgian, or European beers. Or honestly, anyone who likes beers at all. It’s a must try!",4.56
Bleue (Blue),"Received this cellared version in a trade with @Providence - Date code is L11-545 So bottled in 2011? No idea, but he said it was old.
Poured rather darker than expected for an Ale; almost cola brown. The manila colored head lasted a very brief time before retreating just to the circumference of the glass.
The aroma was potent! Lots of dark fruit (Think figs and/or prunes) and a surprising amount of spice - almost akin to a Christmas ale - curious as I wasn't expecting that at all.
The flavor follows, the malts lead the party but the spices (cinnamon, nutmeg?) want to play too. It may be my imagination but it seems they didn't want to get along. Didn't matter to me, I enjoyed it anyway.
The feel was better than expected if this is indeed an 11 year old bottle. I would not have guessed that at all; but now I kick myself for not grabbing a fresher one for a side by side.
Really good beer, but then, that seems to be the consensus.",4.56
Bleue (Blue),"This one is prototypical of the style for me, a classic for good reason. I've had it many times, but not recently, and never reviewed til now.
Bottled 2021, date/batch code L21-561.
Strong aromas and flavors of deep caramel, spiced figs, cherries and roast malts. Lively carbonation and bright yeast esters, good sweetness at the front with a dry finish.
Outstanding beer.",4.6
Bleue (Blue),"Pour is a light cola colored, but once in the glass it's a much deeper, darker brown. While the pour was fairly aggressive, there was more head than I anticipated, although it only last a couple minutes before receding to a thin spotty cap. Aroma is loads of rich malts, caramel & figs. Taste more or less follows the nose, with some bready notes joining the party. Well balanced, deceptively complex, and super easy drinking in a way that belies its ABV. Very good.",4.25

Smell...light hint of citrus and hops. Soft smell of malt
Taste...Sweet malt with dark fruit , taste of sugar. banana and yeast.
Feel...Definitely a lightness not expected and light lacing presence on the beer.
Overall...a decent beer just not my cup of tea. Don't get the excitement of this style so my score definitely reflects that. i am glad it was a gift because the price on these suckers are exorbitant.",3.37
Dirty Bastard,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, bottled on 7/21/22

On the pour a fine khaki 2 finger head formed then slowly receded and became rocky, as well as clinging to the glass. The body is a nice amber to red with light carbonation. Beautiful lacing.

Aroma is big sweet caramel toffee malts with just the right amount of lightly fruity british ale yeast. Not as big smelling as I expected.

Taste is huge. At first it's all the malt and the yeast notes, before a big wave of bitter hops come to balance the almost candy like malts. A decent bit of alcohol can be tasted as well but it works with everything else going on. The finish is almost holiday spicey, with a bit of sweetness. It would pair well with whiskey, although it's not quite as spirit adjacent as a barrel aged beer nor as smoky as a Rauchbier. Honestly a nice change of pace withing my preferred category of malty beers without the change just being to add American hops.

Feel is very mouthcoating with a light to medium carbonation, but this beer has quite a body to it. On the lips it feels thicker than water, and it almost slides down the throat, but it's very smooth. At the same time there is a bit of a warming sensation from the alcohol which definitely slows me down a bit, but this type of beer is meant to be savored, not to refresh.

Overall this was a very enjoyable wee heavy scotch ale. A bit more hoppy than most are, but they aren't fruity, just big bitter, and I think European as well. Big malts shine and are sweet but nicely balanced, and a great beer to kick off the fall season here.",4.15
Dirty Bastard,"Milk chocolate brown, reddish shine, large tan head retains well and leaves decent lacing. Smell reminds me a little of some wheat beers I don’t really like.

Dirty Bastard,"12 ounce bottle poured into a snifter at fridge temp. Rich foam, good retention. Sweet on the nose, toffee, medium roastiness. Taste is classic wee heavy with a nice hop note. Perfect carbonation, smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a tasty treat that’s on the button and not overpowering.",4.0
Dirty Bastard,"Dirty Bastard dumped into a 20oz. glass out of a 12oz. bottle. Picture perfect dark brew slight amber shade when held up to a light. There was a solid three finger dark, thick, tan head. The foam retention is excellent! This is clear enough that when held up to the light I can observe a high amount of carbonation.
The aroma is a pleasant sweet roasted malts, and caramel notes.
The flavor is sweet caramel but dry, with a light bitter finish.
The feel is medium, dry as I said, the carbonation is not prevalent on the tongue, after several sips and the brew warms I can pick up a bit of ABV heat, but it does not take away from the enjoyment of the flavor or session.
This is a very good Scotch Ale, one that I will revisit.",4.32
Dirty Bastard,First time trying this beer and I have to say it's pretty darn good. As soon as I saw the color I was thinking Guinness but taste completely different than how it looks. Smooth going down especially on a hot summer day. Definitely going to have to get this around to friends to try,4.78
Dirty Bastard,"Look - poured from a 12 oz bottle into a standard pint glass. dark copper in color, lightly hazy with some suspended particles. one finger head with excellent lacing retention.

Smell - caramel, toffee, and lots of malty sweetness. some booze detectable. warm spices and yeast also detectable.

Taste - an explosion of malt flavor and some syrupy sweetness, though also balanced with bitterness. not much smokiness, contrary to what is advertised on the bottle. finish is warm. heavy, but not overwhelmingly so.

Feel - medium-full bodied, low carbonation, and on the heavier side at 8.5% ABV. alcohol is not masked but is not harsh. in fact, the warmness gives this beer an extra layer of added complexity.

Overall - a very complex and very tasty malt-heavy beer that showcases a wide range of flavor while remaining surprisingly drinkable.",4.09
Dirty Bastard,"April 30, 2022 - Dark copper, crystal clear, so dark you must hold it up to a light to see through it. Fluffy, lacy tan head, recedes slowly; I like the aroma, faint as it is to my invalid sniffer; Fully robust in flavor, a little tangy; Not a particularly robust mouthfeel, mild carbonation, but not bad. I like this beer. I expect I'll get it again.",4.01
Dirty Bastard,"Appearance: Pours a very very dark ruby red color, verging on brown. Tan colored head disappeared in a flash.

Smell: Brown sugar, Coca-Cola, oatmeal cookies.

Taste: Brown sugar and dark bread up front. The sweetness and bitterness duke each other out half way through. Towards the finish I get a bit of charred coffee grounds and a sweet toasted caramel note. Nutty and dry finish. Balanced.

Overall: Great beer.",4.15
Dirty Bastard,"I’ve heard so much hype surrounding Founders that I decided I’d finally give them a try, I would have sooner if it weren’t for the price. The Dirty Bastard seemed the most likely to be up my alley. After arriving home to pour into a glass and take my first sip, I immediately realize what I’ve been missing. This beer hit me on the first sip with such rich and delightful flavor, something that you kind of take for granted in beer when you’re not used to it. Instead of trying to explain the soul of this ale, I just want to say that this was a perfect first try from this brewery and really enjoyed the experience the beer brought me.",4.41
Dirty Bastard,"Purchased as a single bottle from Ingles for $1.50. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Pours a pitch black, but copper when held to the light. One-finger tan head with fantastic lacing.
S - Brown sugar, oak smoke, and Cohiba Red Dots. A broad sense of earthiness, but I can't be really specific.
T - Deep dark caramels, brown bread, and molasses. Darkened toast comes through the most, though. Bitter, but not overbearingly so; it goes well with this brew. Ethanol comes through towards the end of the glass.
F - Warms your body like nothing else! Smooth. Full-bodied with medium carbonation. Very heavy.
O - A fantastic ale, well-worth trying out. This would be perfect as a bonfire-with-friends-beer. Go out and try it!",4.13

Cloudy copper-brown with golden highlights. Two fingers variegated tan head. Spotty lacing with a full ring and large continents on the surface.
Malty molasses, tobacco, brown sugar, oak, berry aromas.
Char and peat in the taste, along with black bread, oak, toffee, floral hops, light mineral flavors.
Good carbonation, noticeable alcohol heat, bitter aftertaste, medium bodied.
Good depth of flavors which richer with warming. This bottle is a year old and shows no ill effects.",4.05
Dirty Bastard,"Bottled 11/23/21. Poured at 57°. Deep amber/ruby brown body with excellent clarity; three fingers of khaki mixed bubbles foam; looong cap retention; heavy minus lacing and heavy ring; medium legs on swirl. Caramel malt and floral hops nose; light smokiness as beer warms. Bitter hops on entry, with caramel sweetness right behind; mild nuttiness; dry finish. Silky plus feel; medium plus body; moderate minus carbonation; no warmth from 8.5% abv.

O: great try it",4.27

Samuel Adams Octoberfest,Pours a solid golden amber color with finger or two foamy head. Smells of a toasty caramel scented malt. Tastes the same with smoothness similar to a Irish red but slightly different. An absolute fall classic and is loved by most. There is a reason this is a common draft amongst establishments in the fall. Boston does it well with this Sam Adams seasonal.,4.48
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a pint shaker and had to pour in stages as the head was so aggressive. The color was beautiful copper with the manilla colored head, looks enticing.
The aroma was ideal for a Märzen style, the malts and caramel and touch of spice, oh, this smelled good.
The taste was okay, a letdown after the hard sell- the aforementioned malts were there but rather undefined. It was curious after the aroma was so spot on and the taste just dropped off. Weird.
The feel was excellent, no worries there.
Smooth and so easy to drink.
OA, very strange, parts of this excel but somehow the flavors can’t back the rest up.",3.68
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Did I just get a bad batch or do I need a tastebud transplant?

It doesn't even smell or taste like beer. I can't even tell you how it tastes as I can't find the words to do so.

I was drinking Bell's Octoberfest last week. Enjoyed it very much.

Thought I would save a few dollars this week, but ending up throwing away $12.99 for Samuel Adams.

Ugh.",1.18
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"I returned to SA Octoberfest after about 10 years away, and I can't say that the time has done it any favors. I remember a good quality Marzen with a nice flavor profile that, yes, sometimes had its off years, but on the whole was a steady performer in the American O-fest scene.

The only constant from the beer I remember is the great look, a beautiful dark amber. The rest just seems muddled. For me, the taste is a bit off, with a flat malt expression that doesn't have much character or depth, and too much bitterness on the finish. Maybe they've increased the hop bill to meet current tastes? Well it doesn't suite my palate. While nicely medium bodied, it has an unfortunate tendency to syrup-coat your mouth after the swallow.

Would I choose this over a lot of other standard party/bbq offerings? Absolutely. But with so many great, small craft options these days, it might be another 10 years before I buy SA Octoberfest again.",3.14
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Had on tap (alledgedly tapped yesterday) at Hoffbrau Bar and Grill in Westminster, CO

On arrival a fine one finger head was present that relatively quickly dissipated to a ring around the rim and very light covering. Carbonation is lazy and fine in a reddish brown amber body. No lacing.

Aroma has some nice lightly estery Germans tyle lager yeast with a very low hopping rate. A nice nutty roasted malt is peeking its head through pretty aggressively.

Taste is similar to the aroma with a low hopping rate, and a surprisingly flavorful but pleasant German style lager yeast that plays a big role here. Once the fermentation character passes a big wave of nutty roasted malts takes over.

Feel is insanely drinkable with a medium body for easy drinking but a bit more body for that oktoberfest. Very soft and smooth. Not the sweetest but the malts are mouthcoating. On the medium finish it starts drying out a bit.

Overall this is a very nice malty oktoberfest. Flavorful and it tastes German. Very light hops as per style, but it doesn't go great with hoppy amber lagers as I just found out.",3.79
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Created an account just to say that I agree with the review posted by ABeingWhoDrinksBeer in Dec 2021.

Overly malty and enough sweetness to ruin the brew. I also get a hint of chocolate, which doesn't work for me in a beer.

Looks good, but that's about it.

Unfortunately, the Pacific Northwest is awash in IPAs, which makes it hard for someone like me who's not a huge IPA fan to find a decent craft beer that isn't an IPA. I spotted this in Costco and figured, ""I like Sam Adams, how bad could this be?"" and proceeded to buy a case of 36 (!) bottles.

I sure hope one of my buddies like this... I can't bring myself to dump it down the drain.",1.52
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"An ok entry level Oktoberfest style beer.
It's missing the malt complexity of a true German beer of this style, but overall it's not bad. There's better by far.",3.93
Samuel Adams Octoberfest,"Bought pint of draft at a minor league ball game, so I paid way too much for a beer. Rich golden, reddish, tan color with off white foam that diminished after a few minutes.

West Coast IPA,"Only photos could describe the foamy white mess that rises above the top of a clear glass liter mug. It’s that pathetic. Really, no beer pour, especially an IPA should ever have this much stark white starchy foam pretending to be a head. This is the consequence of trying to fit two twelve ounce cans' contents into the vessel. With patience, the foam recedes and there becomes almost a true beer head. Obviously, there are concerns, as big white foamy and starchy heads often lead to taste and mouthfeel disappointments. The aroma is of OK piney hoppiness; but, so far, it's looks over aroma and looks have a big negative lead. The color isn't the problem. It's a rich and bright dark amber that's close to being translucent. Actually, it's a pretty good looking brew once the head recedes. Much as expected, this is a nicely West Coast hopped rendition, without much of a malt inclusion to carry it via its body, nor to give it a counterbalance so necessary for a great IPA. The ratings here may be inconsistent, but that sums up the brew. There's good color, but bad lacing. There's a nice sharp piney hop bite, but no malt balance, nor backbone. This isn't bad and the tastes of those that want hoppiness, even at the expense of a malty presence, will like this. To taste, it's a nicely dry hopped ale. To anyone that loves a traditional IPA, the lack of barley malt in the mix will spoil this.",4.02
West Coast IPA,"Slightly hazy, rich amber appearance with a generous, fine bubbled head that left rings of good lacing. Big time piney, resinous hop aroma, some citrus, with an initial hit of sweetness that fades after a few moments. Medium bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. The profuse amount of hops engage the palate from the start well into the lingering, long lasting finish",4.18
West Coast IPA,"From a 12oz can dated 12/13/21 into a pint glass.

Pours a translucent brownish orange with about a half finger of with head (gentle pour). Ok retention and lacing.

Smells of fresh cut grass and pint. Also got a hint of marijuana.

Piney, resiny, bitter taste. 95 IBUs in their glory-Right in the wheelhouse for a WCIPA. Some malts in there as well-bit of caramel.

Very sticky mouthfeel-full bodied. Strong bitter aftertaste. Medium carbonation.

This is a WCIPA. Hit the mark squarely. And stinking enjoyable too.",4.3
West Coast IPA,"Haven’t had this in almost 10 years so here go: pours a deep, dark gold with decent head. Smells of grapefruit and herbal hops. Tastes like grapefruit rind, melon, orange, strawberry, it’s bitter, and a little herbal with a string malt base. A little dry, also, and very drinkable and balanced. Whether this is close to the beer I had back in 2012 is hard to say, and I’m way more tolerant of hops now than then, but this is good and I’ll buy it again, cheers!",4.15
West Coast IPA,"An outstanding example of the style, West Coast IPA. Pours an inviting amber/orange with 1 finger of foamy off white head. Nose is full of pine needles and citrus.

West Coast IPA,"Pours a crystal clear dark gold with a creamy white head.

Smells like sweet biscuit maltiness with pine and tangerine.

Sweet biscuity malt on the palate, finishing with a nice drying pine bitterness and a hint of grapefruit.

Overall, a solid, textbook example of the style. It will scratch the itch if WCIPA is the itch that you have.",3.75
West Coast IPA,Clear amber body with a dirty beige head that crashes in on itself before too long. Piney scent combines the alcohol and hops in a spicy to near astringent aroma.

Dead Guy Ale,"Delicious for an American maibock. Was not a fan of rogue beer, but this one is delicious, I recommend it, 6.8 and bitterness around 30. Smooth and doesn’t get yoy drunk !!",5.0
Dead Guy Ale,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle
Glass: 0.5L Pokal
Pouring Temp: 50.6 F


Look:
Deep and slightly hazy copper with an initial 2-finger creamy light beige head. The head dissipates to a thin but consistent cover with excellent soapy lacing down the glass.

Smell:
Tons of sweet bready malts laced with honey and either toffee or caramel. There is also a subtle earthy note along with hints of floral hops.

Taste:
Starts with bready malts and toffee then a strong earthiness asserts itself and dominates the taste. A light bitterness also appears alongside the earthiness and grows throughout the sip.

Feel:
Smooth feel. Body is medium with a slight lean towards the lighter side.

Overall:
A nice beer full of strong but balanced flavors. It reminds me of an ESB more than a Maibock, but regardless, it is a solid brew.

My ratings reflect how the beer smells/tastes/etc as a Maibock.
If this was categorized as an ESB my ratings would be more akin to the following (give or take):

S: gingerbread malts, a little alcohol bite, sweetness, and dark fruits.

T: follows nose, feels very Christmasy. There some pineapple in there too but it’s so well blended it’s hard to tell. Something just stands out I’m not sure what it is.

F: medium- full body. Not heavy, just says hello.

O: felt more like a winter beer than a spring one, but happy to try and enjoy it. This is a local brew and the style isn’t represented enough where I live otherwise I would have tried the style years ago. This nails what I imagine a classic winter/spring hearty food ol beer would taste like.",4.45
Dead Guy Ale,"Canned 3 months ago on 10/19/21
Poured into a shaker, small head that thinned out quickly. Minimal lacing, glass might not have been beer-clean. As seen in at least one other review, honey-colored is the best color descriptor. Rising effervescence.
Smell is malt, floral and apple
Taste is semi-malty with slight grapefruit bite
Feel is okay. Nothing spectacular and nothing off-putting. Bitterness balances the taste and feel.

Hard to rate this one. I wish the ""Overall"" rating carried more weight here. Each individual attribute is better than mediocre, but the sum of its parts is much better than one might think if considering each aspect individually. It's a good, solid, well-rounded tasty beer. I wouldn't necessarily seek it out, but if I was at the store and on the fence about what to buy and saw it, I'd remember, ""Hey, that was a good one""",3.89

Dead Guy Ale,"Everyone keeps saying that this is heavy on the malt. I was expecting a nice malty flavor but was greeted with something a little more akin to an IPA due to the heavy addition of bitter hops. Beautiful honey color and a sweet smell on the pour. I am not an IPA fan, so this wasn’t for me- however, I liked this better than other hoppy beers.",3.36
Dead Guy Ale,"Pours a beautiful murky caramel. A few fingers of tan bubbly, foam rises and recedes to an off white ring leaving soapy lacing. Nose is green apple, honey, and sweet malt. Taste is honey, oak, roasted malt, biscuit, grass, and lemon. All melding together perfectly to create a truly delightful masterpiece. Feel is silky smooth and very full. Love this and will buy more.",4.16
Dead Guy Ale,This is an interesting Octoberfest type beer. Smell is of spices and orange peel. Has a full bodied feel. Taste is a bit all over the place. I don't know if this beer wants to be a marzen or a pale ale. You get a bit of honey along with a nice Bock hop taste. Some citrus with coriander. Interesting beer and can't say I've had one quite like this.,3.87
Dead Guy Ale,"Dark amber small white head, not much retention. Way to dark for the style.
Smells of caramel, brown bread, for the most part it smells good.
Tastes initially sweet but a huge hit of bittering hops hits you straight away. The hops completely drown out the malts. A Maibock should be malt forward with the hops way in the background. I can’t say this is a bad beer it’s just not anything like a maibock.",3.57

Imperial Stout,"12oz bottle. This thing has been aged in the mini-fridge for 5+ years (!) and now is the time to crack this sucker (review from notes)

5 years and it still has a decent amount of carbonation and a nice little ring of foam. It was meant to age, this is telling me. Smells like coffee, alcohol, chocolate, and hops. Prominent alcohol flavor, even at chilled temps and with the age on it. This was a bad boy back in the day, I bet. Tons of cocoa powder and a honey malt backing that compliments and stands up to the choco malt and alcohol flavors that come close to dominating

Overall: A really drinkable IPA here. Nice citrus and some slight stonefruit notes. Then a clean and moderately bitter finish. Incredibly clean for 7.5%. This one would sneak up on you. Drinks pretty to style for a West-coast IPA. I don't know that there's anything here that makes this one special. Somewhat surprised by the 93 Rating on BeerAdvocate. Surely it's historical. Maybe my expectations were too high. Nonetheless, a good IPA and dangerously drinkable. (Rating: 3.91)",3.91

Malty, citrusy, and bitter, the way an IPA should be. Since then I bought a not-so-fresh six pack, and it wasn’t great. I believe this partially explains the high variance of scores on this site.

GLASSWARE : Maudite snifter... this pours a beautiful, glowing orange amber body alive with effervescence... its two-finger head is white and staunch, settling to a lacy ring... robust resin and pine, pineapple, lime and mango... hard fruits mix with thick malts to produce an aromatic balance to the hops--an aggressive yet controlled offering... a bit boozy too, but not at all intrusive or off-putting... active, lively at its introduction, strong in its presence and lasting in its finish... its citrus and resin shine here, bright and thick, puckerish and chewy... the grapefruit especially resounds in each sip, thick and appreciable... big, bold fruits make this worth returning to, a classic that is accessible, both in stores and in profile...",4.31
Racer 5,"From a bottle at the Sixteen Mile House in Millbrae. Pours a cloudy amber. They claim to have launched the hops competition, and I believe it. Piney and grapefruit. The hops lingers, so I take a while between sips.",4.04
Racer 5,"Two words can describe this IPA - juicy and hoppy...

This was a huge hop-punch to my mouth - very juicy, and enough booze to pull it all together in a nice looking beer. I was also impressed with the full-bodied mouthfeel.

On the bottle it claims it helped start the on-going hop craze. After having this, I have to agree...",4.13
Racer 5,"Reviewed from 22 oz. bomber. No visible date on bottle. This is one I used to drink a lot in the early days of exploring craft beer. It's a local staple at bars in the bay area. I always remember it being a brightly flavored IPA. Let's dive into this glass. Beautiful amber color with a rich creamy head. Beautiful lacing all over the glass. Moderate carbonation. Aroma of pine, orange marmalade, lemon zest and candied malts. I have a feeling this isn't the freshest it could be but it seems approachable enough. The malts give off a slight bready smell. Good taste. Bright fruit flavors and a decent amount of bitterness backed up by a strong malt foundation. Slightly refreshing and the alcohol isn't discernible at 7.5%. This beer can be dangerous if you put too many back without thinking because it's that drinkable. I go back for a second chug and it is just as refreshing as the first. A very well balanced moderately hopped example of a west coast IPA. In a time before double IPA's and triple IPA's this was the go to strong ale along with Mendocino brewery's Eye of the Hawk.",4.19
Porter,"Totally opaque, color of black coffee, huge tan head dies fairly quickly, lots of sparkly lacing. Nose is quite muted, malt present. Flavor is great, relatively light with malty and chocolatey notes. Average feel and finish. Would drink occasionally.",4.19
Porter,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp for ~20 min, before pouring into round-bottomed stein

Look: Dark espresso, with brown highlights and a 3-finger, dense, tight, brown head. As it drinks, thick lacings trace the glass

Smell: Sweet malt, bready yeast, espresso, and coca predominate

Taste: Cold-brew espresso at the front, with nutty and chocolatey notes, giving way to an herbal, medicinal note in the middle, before finishing with a sweet, mocha taste. Lingering aftertaste reminiscent of that of a cup of hot cocoa.

Mouthfeel: Bready, thick, lightened by a significant amount of fine carbonation on the tongue, giving way to a syrupy thickness going down. Coats the mouth well, perpetuating that post-cocoa aftertaste, mentioned above

Overall: ""At least out loud I won't say I'm in love""

In all seriousness, though, this is a terrific beer. Perhaps a tad bit sweet at the end, but not cloyingly so, and balanced well by the rest of the flavor notes. Also, it's not so boozy I won't remember it, either",4.43
Porter,"Founders Porter-dark, rich, and sexy! This 12oz. bottle was given an aggressive pour into a 20oz. weizen glass. Three fingers of creamy tan foam that lasts. As it slowly recedes there is some thick lacing left behind. This porter is very dark, there is no chance of observing carbonation.
The aroma is fantastic, sweet chocolate, caramel, malty, and a pinch of coffee!
The flavor is sweet but quickly gives way to the coffee flavors, with a dry, bitter finish.
The feel is medium, very smooth, maybe because of the light carbonation, with the dry finish I was talking about.
This looks great, smells wonderful, and each sip begs me to come back for more. Tonight this is a liquid dessert nightcap.",4.43
Porter,"If there is a better Porter I would like to have a pour. Like drinking a flour less chocolate caramel cake with an espresso dumped on top. Delicious aperitif. A world class beer, indeed.",4.96
Porter,"Poured pitch black with a mocha color 1 finger head that slowly dissipated and left no lacing. But just looking at it made me really want to drink it, looks wonderful.
The aroma was toasted coffee and baker’s cocoa with some caramel around the edges.
The taste followed- with the addition of what seemed to be hops. A distinct bitterness closed out the sips with an almost stout like malt flavor leading the charge.
The feel, well, made for sipping, it’s ideal for that!
I have had this on tap and should have rated it then, but better now (from 12 oz bottle) than never. It’s very good, but I think I prefer Baltic Porters.",4.24
Porter,"Look - 12 oz bottle poured into a standard pint glass. Dark brown in color, approaching black. small tan-colored head with moderate lacing retention.

Smell - dark chocolate with subtle malty notes, along with some light smokiness. contrary to the bottle and other reviews, I don't detect a lot of hops in the smell alone. the smell is well balanced and very pleasant.

Taste - light black malty bitterness hits the palate first, which builds. this is then complemented by hoppy bitterness that is very much apparent (unlike in the smell), which creates an interesting contrast. other characteristics from the smell, including the dark chocolate and smoky notes all displayed prominently in the taste profile. finish is long, with some lingering bitterness.

Feel - medium bodied, above average carbonation, and on the higher end in ABV for the style at 6.5%.

Overall - I think one of the reasons this beer gets such high marks is how clearly it fits the definition of a robust porter and how clearly it delineates from a stout (or a lighter porter). it does check off nearly every box for the style, and is an excellent textbook representation.",4.08
Porter,"Not very excited about this one. It began when I paid $15 for a six pack. It was labeled incorrectly on the shelf. There were ten people in line behind me and one clerk so, grumbling, I paid and left. Probably for the last time.
Refrigerated for 24 hours and then left to sit 30 minutes or so at room temperature. It’s 71 Fahrenheit today actually.
Poured into a wine stem. No surprises. Opaque, black beer with brownish foam.
First impression on the nose is pure hops. For me, never a good sign. Beneath that, some pretty standard chocolate and light coffee-caramel action. If you know the style, it’s textbook and uninspired.
Taste repeats the nose. Nothing special here at all, which they attempt to hide with the hops. Just lazy.
Finishes better than it begins but it’s a low bar. Pretty heavy and thick. I would have thought the ABV higher.
I have enjoyed a few Founders brews but this is not one. The high score is bewildering to me but, hey, enjoy it if you can. Cheers!",3.34
Porter,"This is a beer I have enjoyed for many years and was surprised to realize I had yet to review it. While irrelevant to the review, I love the label art.

A big, two-inch head glistens with dark, chestnut hues. A pancake batter forms over the opaque blackness within a Harp nonic. The batter ever so slowly retreats, leaving dense patches of lace in its wake. The head never fully dissipates, rather, it forms a quarter inch of dense cream to be penetrated with each sip.

Dark roasted Bakers chocolate yields to rich, roasted coffee beans. Later, malted chocolate mixes with caramel and light hints of floral and mint notes from the hops.

The flavor follows the nose, while the roasted nuances are subdued. Bitterness edges out sweetness and both are well controlled. The hops are more like pine straw than the floral or mint observed in the aroma. This could be a savory dessert with its light umami dancing in the long, mild finish.

The light to medium body is low for the style. A smooth, fluffy texture envisions dense fur. Soft carbonation lifts the light dryness, while residual sugar builds on the lips.

This goes well with a cigar, however, it is so good on its own, that one should reserve most of it for the pure drinking experience. It elevates a ribeye. Today, I enjoyed it while reading as my wife played the harp, on a cold, wet, November, Sunday afternoon.",4.34
Porter,"Pours a deep, dark mocha-brown, giving it a brown-black hue rather than ruby. A thin, half finger tan head appears and quickly recedes.

Gorgeous aromas here, there are three stars: chocolate and rich cocoa, roasted and toasty caramel malts, and smoky coffee beans.

Taste follows the nose to a T. The chocolate is smoother here, more sweet with toffee and caramelized sugar notes than cocoa. The smoky notes are tones down, and the roasted malty, toasted bread flavours are a little more subtle. Some lighter coffee bean tastes, but it’s in the background and well integrated, which is nice and gives this a balanced flavour profile. No major appearance of hop flavours aside from a very light bitterness on the finish. The bitterness feels like it comes from the roasted malts rather than typical hoppy notes, which is enjoyable in a Porter/stout.

Semi-dry finish, with a medium body that leans to the lighter side. Lower carbonation, which results in a very smooth sip, the very very gentle bubbles roll over the tongue and lightly froth at the end creating a creamy sensation. Gentle finish, lightly bitter with nice malty and chocolate notes.

After a lot of (sadly local) poor stouts and porters, when I cracked this open and poured it and got a whiff of delicious aromas just from opening it, I got very excited! That being said, I will temper that a bit by saying I don’t think I can rate this as high as it is on BA. I definitely enjoy stouts and porters with huge, bold flavours. That said, Founders Porter doesn’t necessarily need to be powerful, holding its own by dialing up a few key flavours and melding then together in complex and subtle ways.

The line between porters and stouts is very blurry, and between a ‘robust’ porter and stout (or imperial stout), well, it gets quite confusing. Some would say (and they have!) that these porters are meant to be more subtle and complex than stouts. Since the line is so blurred I just try to take it on my personal tastes. Regardless of all of that, this is still an excellent beer. My next aim is to try this on tap (unlikely for now as I live in Canada) and trying to get a super fresh bottle. Mine was four months out of bottling so some of the flavours might have mellowed",4.07
Porter,"Look: Dark black pour with very little foam risen to the surface.
Smell: Reminds me of a stout kind of chocolate with high malts. On the bottle it says there's a caramel smell to it - didn't catch that in my pour.
Taste: Immediate taste of malts, chocolate, slight caramel taste as well towards the end with a bitter finish. Well done! This is a really good porter - probably the best I've tried so far. (I've only tried 6 porters - more of a stout guy).
Feel: Medium to full bodied - light carbonation.
Overall: The reason I bought this beer was because I've heard about it before, and in some way it reminded me of a stout. This beer is a very good beer, definitely would buy again in the future.",4.46
Porter,"Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good-looking Porter.

Smell: Fairly moderate roasted malts and mild brown sugar notes.

Taste: The taste profile features subdued roasted malt note, some dark chocolate notes, and mild coffee notes, with some bitter hop notes at the end. The finish is fairly dry ending on the roast malt notes and bittering hop notes.

Mouth-feel: on the light side of medium bodied with a fairly generous level of carbonation.

Overall: A good non bal-aged porter. The flavor profile nicely integrates all the different elements present.",3.97
Porter,"Bought a case of this about mid-2021, tasted like the label described, smooth, etc. Bought another case the other day, bottled December 2021, tastes like a campfire. Never liked that in a stout, let alone a Porter, and certainly wouldn't have repurchased if the previous batch tasted like it. Anyone want 23 bottles of burnt Porter?",2.22
Porter,"This is a nice contrast to all the coffee-centric stout porters on the market. I want to think that this is a larger fermented porter based on it's character. Either way, larger or ale, the mouth feel is crispy, tingled froth. Nose is edge of smokey roasted, with a base of yeastyness. Appearance is strong, and fades to respectable porter carbonation. Flavor is burnt ends, charred wood, and hop balance. Dark chocolate akaline finish. Overall, a powerful player in the porter game to put balance in the force.",4.26
Porter,"Drinking this at The Parsons Pub in downtown Murphy NC.
Poured from a twelve ounce bottle into a pint glass.
Looks dark brown almost black with a nice tannish foamy head that dropped quickly to a thin cap.
Smells malty, sweet, chocolate and coffee.
Taste follows the nose nicely, lots of chocolate coffee and caramel.
Mouth feel is medium for the style with a nice creamy finish.
Overall a very nice example of a Porter that I would definitely order again.
Cheers!",4.33
Porter,"Bottle to pint glass. Bottled 12/1/21.

L: Deep dark brown (not quite black); coffee-colored. Light brown head that fades slowly.
S: Chocolate, just a little bit boozy. Caramel sweetness too.
T: Lots more chocolate, a little coffee flavor mixed in. A little bitterness but not as much as expected from other reviews.
F: Smooth but heavy enough for a porter.
O: A great example of the style, though not as on the mark as Edmund Fitzgerald.",4.16
Porter,"Poured from a 12oz bottle dated 10-20-2021 into a 12oz Tulip glass

This is my first ever review. Here goes. Simply outstanding.

L: Black , opaque . Can’t see through the liquid black gold. Using a flashlight on my phone from the other side no light passes through. A nice fluffy tan , creamy-looking head that dissipates after a couple minutes into a nice thick ring that leaves silky lacing on the glass as it goes.

S: plenty of toasty coffee , and chocolate on the nose, some type of dark fruit maybe ? Malty. And caramel .

T: Non sweet chocolate and malt up front , and tons of toasted coffee and hops on the finish that blend perfectly . Not too bitter, but sweet actually. Roasted coffee beans linger on the finish, and the aftertaste. Simply fantastic.

F: Mildly carbonated , between medium to full-bodied on the mouthfeel. Mild carbonation on the finish that bodes well with the aftertaste . Not as silky as some stouts. Not as full bodied as some stouts. This is a porter. A fantastic example of a Porter.

Overall I give this beer a 4.75 , give or take. Fantastic example of the style . One of the , if not the absolute best Porter I’ve ever had .",4.78
Porter,"This is a good Porter. In fact, though I don’t drink porter much, this is the top of the list. It is thick, flavorful, and smooth. It is nutty, chocolate, and coffee infused. Very tasteful and hardly any aftertaste. Thumbs up!",4.61
All Day IPA,"Pours a golden color with a decent white head.
The smell is of hops and some citrus.
Taste is of citrus and hops.
Overall, this is a good IPA to have in your refrigerator.",3.92
All Day IPA,"An above average light beer. Lots of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er. Hard to rate, because there isn't anything ""wrong"" with it, but it's not special in any regard. Piney bitter, little (to no) sweetness. Again, there's a noticeable amount of flavor and smell for a 4.7%-er.",3.33
All Day IPA,"There’s a ‘little bit’ of everything a session IPA should have, but not a damn thing that distinguishes it from the rest of the pack.
Session beers? Drink Local!",3.65
All Day IPA,"Everyone else has it pretty much covered. For what I’ll say, there’s quite a lot of additions here to bolster up the smell, taste, and mouthfeel. Flaked corn, wheat, barley, oats. Definitely comes through in the body and finish, body is thicker than any beer at 4.7% should be, crisp finish. Excellent malty, grainy, aftertaste with the weight of a medium bodied beer, despite the beer being a little more sessionable than a full medium-heavy bodied beer . Not particularly bitter, though my tastebuds might be hop fried these days. Founders knows what they’re doing. It’s not unbelievably complex and yet, for a session beer, it also kind of is. Very pleasant stuff.",3.93
All Day IPA,"Yields a slightly clouded golden amber color with a huge, spongy head.

Smells of ripe oranges, papaya and spicy garden herbs among lighter blueberries and fresh cut limes.

Has an utmost refreshing and light mouthfeel to it, due to its well balanced body and fitting, prominent effervescence.

Tastes of malty, slightly resinous caramel among headstrong, bitter hops, leading with unpretentious limes, as well as more subtle exotic fruits. Offers a pleasant bready middle part, with even more pronounced bitter limes, creating an intriguing, yet easy to comprehend and well working interplay. Finishes with a bit more luscious oranges and papaya among rustic bread rind, a note of resin and long lasting, finish defining bitter limes.

This is great! Such a refreshing, perfectly balanced low abv beer with a satisfying complexity is hard to find.",4.37
All Day IPA,"You’ve read the reviews. You’ve read the tasting and smelling notes. All you need to know, is that this should be your go to session beer. Happy 4th!",3.54
All Day IPA,"Clear light amber color with a moderate ivory head that sticks around fairly well and produces some nice lacing.
The aroma is light sweet malt with citrus and a touch of pine.
The taste is likewise grapefruit, tangerine, light malt with a dry lingering grapefruit pulp and pine resin finish.
The body is medium, fairly smooth, good carbonation, very drinkable.
Altogether this brew is, as advertised, an excellent session brew, especially during warm weather, light and refreshing, enjoy.",3.93
All Day IPA,"OMG, why have I waited so long to try this beer. Its been out for several years now and it's still the best sessionable IPA I've ever had. Mouth feel is crisp, refreshing, and carbonated. Taste is that of an old school WC IPA, hoppy, malty, with a little pine. This beer is great for day drinking. I'll be keeping my fridge stocked with these guys this summer.",4.5

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not sure what happened to the review I already did but at the end of it I said that this was my favorite session IPA. Let's see if that stands the test of time. It's poured a lightly hazy deep gold body beneath a full head of slightly off-white foam. The aroma is citrusy and piney over a delicate and lightly bready malt base. On to the taste... it's basically the same. The malt is lightly sweet, bready, grainy, and biscuity. The hops deliver notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and pine. There's a light touch of hop resin to it as well. The bitterness clocks in at 42 IBUs balancing it and bringing it to a dry, bitter finish with some citrus pith and pine lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and crisp. The head held up pretty well and it's left some nice lacing about the glass. In my opinion this is very much a pale ale with extra hops and that's fine with me. It's 4.7% ABV which is .3% below Budweiser (at least in the U.S.), and 140 calories. I've had multiple servings of this over the course of a day (COVID lockdown!) and I can truly say that it continues to deliver. Now, are there pale ales out there that could do the same thing? Of course there are, but this is an easy go to. If you haven't had it I suggest you try it.

D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking beer overall",3.88
All Day IPA,"It’s not exciting, but it doesn’t need to be. It’s fresh, bright, crisp, refreshing, low alcohol, everything it should be. I gave the look a 5 not necessarily for the beer, but the art work on the can. One of my favorite beers of all time.",4.65
All Day IPA,"Look - poured into a 5 oz tasting glass. dark golden in color, slightly hazy, with not much head but moderate lacing.

Smell - a balance of citrus (both orange and grapefruit) and pine on the nose, along with a bit of sweet malty fragrance.

Taste - light on the palate. moderately hopped with a robust malty backbone that balances well. citrusy hops are detectable on the tongue, but focus is more on flavor rather than bitterness. finish is smooth with lingering hoppy fragrances.

Feel - light bodied, average carbonation, and low ABV at 4.7%.

Overall - this beer is everything as advertised: a sessionable, good tasting IPA that is easy to drink and easily enjoyable by anyone.",3.84
All Day IPA,"Poured from a 12 oz. can into a glass.
The All Day IPA has a nice golden amber color with a good head.
Citrusy aroma, including orange and tangerine with a touch of grapefruit.
The grapefruit and orange flavors come through nicely, but after each sip you're left with an astringent dryness on your tongue.
Light to medium body, perfect for a session beer
It's drinkable, but after one or two the astringency definitely has me wanting to switch to something else.",3.95

L: Clear, copper colored, moderate head with good lacing.

F: Dry, a little resiny.
O: Nothing extraordinary but a good beer for sessioning at the bar or in the backyard.",3.56
All Day IPA,"Sweet floral and citrus on the pour, medium sharp tang on the tongue that settles into a slightly-bitter pinewood taste. Subtle malt flavor in the background. A nice step up from an APA for the recent hops voyagers out there, and a decent ""all day"" for the rest of us.",3.81
Pumking,"Slightly hazy, translucent amber color with a creamy white head. Good retention and a little lacing.

Smells like a pumpkin pie scented candle. Sweet, buttery, biscuity, heavy vanilla notes, cinnamon and other spices.

The taste follows the nose. Sweet, heavy on vanilla cream and toasted bread/pie crust; cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice, and ginger tie it all together, and the spices balance out the rich vanilla and pie crust brown sugar sweetness.

The mouthfee is slick but not syrupy, medium-plus bodied, well carbonated, shockingly drinkable for its abv and sweetness.

I've never been a big fan of pumpkin ales, but this is still the best I've ever tried. Bravo. Liquid pumpkin pie.",4.64
Pumking,"The bottle is a bit boring.
The smell is explicitly pumpkin. Which is a good thing because that’s why I bought it.
The taste is also very pumpkin, but there’s a smooth butteriness in the aftertaste which is super nice.

T---Pumpkin pie spices as in the nose, but also noteable pumpkin. This is what I want.

F---Medium/full bodied. Mild carbonation.

O---An excellent pumpkin beer.",4.12
Pumking,"Tasted artificial I didn't enjoy the after taste.
Normally I love a pumpkin beer but this one did not hit the right spice notes for me. probably would not buy again",3.26
Pumking,"One of the beers I look forward to the most during this season. The look of the beer is what you would typically expect from the style. The nose on this beer is one of the best in pumpkin beer. It's vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin pie and an earthy maltiness. The flavors just explode as you drink it. The higher abv really helps bring out these flavors. If you haven't had this one, get it. You won't regret it.",4.68
Pumking,"This is reaching close to the max of what a pumpkin beer can achieve. The pumpkin taste is deep and natural. The mulling spices are quite nice. So if what you want is a pumpkin beer, then have a Pumking. It doesn’t surprise me at all that this is the most rated pumpkin beer on the site. If you don’t want a pumpkin beer why are you drinking it and giving this a low rating? For the style it’s great.",4.0
Pumking,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium orange color with a mild creamy white head. A strongly bubbling body. SRM of 11. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate and rich bready aromas upfront. There's bread, some smooth orange, and more bread malt. Some sweet potato and pumpkin with a slight pumpkin spice like a pumpkin candle on the finish.

Flavor: Strong bready flavors upfront. There's a pumpkin and sweet orange flavor in the middle, that turns into the pumpkin spice flavor. Finishes with a fall/autumn spice, and slightly bitter finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is smooth, bready, and a small bitter bite on the finish.

Overall: A pretty good and very drinkable pumpkin beer. I haven't had too many pumpkin spiced or pumpkin flavored beers, but this one was the best I've had. Sort of feels like an imperial hefeweizen, but instead of banana bread is flavored with pumpkin. The breadiness is there. There's canned pumpkin and orange. Also some pumpkin and fall spice. Well rounded and drinks well. (Final Rating: 3.91)",3.91
Pumking,"TW////: I drank this in Mona from Genshin Impact cosplay

Look: Nice amber yellow with an orangey tint! Like if you ate a lot of carrots and then you peed! Foamy head dissipates fast but a thin layer remains.

Smell: Like fucking pumpkin pie bitch. Clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, and everything like a pumpkin spice candle, some apple pie smell, some how it smells like toasted crust too! really amazing.

Taste: It tastes like pumpkin pie spit in beer and yeah kinda disappointing. Good malty beer with some cinnamon and clove flavor, and maybe nutmeg?? very little alcohol taste. The smell was amazing and complex, and the beer itself, at least to me, doesn't really have much ""pumpkin"" flavor. I wouldn't be able to tell you it was pumpkin beer if I didn't know beforehand. Its not BAD, its just not pumpkin enough.

Feel: smooth, carbonated little bubbles, doesnt leave your mouth or throat dry.

Overall: This experience is not unlike being invited to a costume party and you work hard on a costume to wear to it, and turns out, you're the only one wearing a costume. Excited to go leading up to drinking it, but once I took a sip, was left kinda disappointed and ashamed. I STREAMED THIS! HOW DARE YOU EMBARASS ME INFRONT OF MY VIEWERS!

Well, you win some. You lose some. And right here I’m becoming ambivalent as it warms. Wait…

Yeah, not much. Still a big dollop of syrup in the aroma, but it has died down a bit in taste. Still nothing to call your mama about.",3.23
Bigfoot,"This beer is not meant as a session ale. I buy it once a year as a treat, and this year in 2022 it is exceptional!

I’d recommend this one for connoisseurs.",4.16
Bigfoot,"2016 bottle from the cellar - not going to lie - not sure I drank any of the 2016 fresh....
Pours a clear garnet, dark ruby colour with tawny beige head. A bit of sediment left in bottle.
Aroma of caramel malt, bread, date but despite age a strong hop burst is there - piney, resin, candied grapefruit peel.
Malty sweetness on the palate - burnt toffee, caramel, date and bread - quickly overcome by a barrage of hop flavours - resinous pine, candied citrus peel, grapefruit with a sticky bitterness coating the palate.
Full sticky mouthfeel, decent carbonation despite aged state with a lingering powerful bittersweetness.

Got my bitterness on, along with Old Rasputin, how I survived (last year) ,... this year? This is not THAT review ...

This year? This beer fucking stinks, on rye, like one reviewer noted, recently, Yes, I finished my one sixer, and just to be sure, wasted the $2.50 on one more single last night ... way too harsh, and plastic, fake, tasting. No balance and this will only got worse over time And while, the other legend Celebration Ale, was very good, it does NOT belong in cans. loses aroma.",1.52
Bigfoot,"2022 bottle poured into a Sierra Nevada Brewing Co tulip glass

A: Pours gorgeous ruby copper amber with a frothy khaki head that settles to a firm layer that hangs around for a bit and leaves plenty of nice lacing.

S: Rich toasty bready malt, toffee, dark and stone fruit, all countered with a strong hit of resinous pine and citrus rind.

T: Hops hit first, citrus, grapefruit and orange, resinous pine, followed by a mix of fruity notes, plum, fig, apricot, peach, cherry, and raisin, toasty bready malt, and toffee sweetness.

M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, just a hint of alcohol.

O: Didn't realize I hadn't logged this one until recently, even though I've had plenty of it before, so I figured I might a well grab a fresh bottle and enter in a baseline, then revisit with a vintage bottle.

Fresh, it drinks kinda like a mix of TIPA and hoppy American Strong Ale, in a good way. English Barleywines get the majority of the attention, but there's a reason this American style one has stayed around so long. (4.28)",4.28
Bigfoot,"Purchased as a single bottle from The Blue Door for $4. 2022 vintage. Poured into a cognac snifter.

L - A fantastic clear ruby, with a two-finger khaki head that doesn't die out. Lacing is excellent.
S - Super floral. Getting rosehip, grapefruit peel, pine tar, and red apple. A hint of ethanol on the nose.
T - Toffee, stone fruit, and pine resin. Juicy grapefruit, followed by a heavy black bread note. Finish is intense and pine-heavy. You really pick up the ABV on the latter half of the glass...
F - Full-bodied, with minimal carbonation. Filling. Warm. Heavy.
O - The king of Sierra Nevada's brews. Like the weathered father of an immature imperial IPA. Dense, intense, and titillating every sense, this one is for the fans. Highly recommend, and I'll be getting another bottle to age.",4.57

Bigfoot,My 2nd foray into a gnarly wine style beer after Lagunitas Brown Shugga. Definitely catch the malts sweetness on the nose but it's the intense malt/hop hit on the 1st sip that is impressive. The booziness definitely becomes apparent as you sip this brew along with the hops as it warms. Overall I love this style and looking forward to cellaring a few of these for a few years.,4.48

Grapefruit, floral, and piney hops over a deep caramel malt aroma with hints of dried fruit

An American classic for a reason",4.64
Bigfoot,"2021 version. Poured 12 oz bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a deep caramel color with an off white head that falls to a cap. Very active carbonation rising up. Aroma is caramel and earthy hops mixed with a combination of dark fruit and citrus fruit. Taste is caramel, malty sweetness, resinous/earthy hops, and alcohol. Feel is thick and chewy with a nice carbonation bite. In the end there's a bit of dryness that sneaks in. There's a definite alcohol warmth with this. Overall, I don't have a lot of experience with barleywines, but I do like this and would buy again.",4.22
Bigfoot,"I first started drinking Bigfoot exactly 10 years ago, and every year, I buy several 6 packs and drink them periodically throughout the year. Today, I'm drinking the 2022 release on 2/5/22. It is outstanding, as usual. There was a ton of hop residue in the bottom of the bottle already, and I like my Bigfoot on the hoppy side, so I swished the last little bit around in the bottom of the bottle before I finished the pour. Pours a beautiful (and slightly hazy) dark cherry to copper hue with a beige head that falls down to an island with a ring around the rim of the glass. Smell is actually slightly mute this time around, but I can detect a slight caramel sweetness that blends well with a general, but faint, hop presence. The taste is definitely hop-forward, as I did swish the residue out of the bottle into my glass, but for me, that makes it perfectly balanced with its absolutely booming malt character. I believe that several hop varieties are used in the brewing of this beer, and the bitter aftertaste is absolutely there, but the malt flavor is so huge that it's hard to pinpoint any one flavor that stands out; it is amazingly well blended. Bitter-sweet medium-thick mouthfeel that finishes quite dry... the alcohol presence is very well hidden... Overall one of the best Bigfoot releases I've had yet!",4.77
Bigfoot,"Long-time Bigfoot enthusiast. Generally you can expect a somewhat-sweet, quite malty version of an IPA, like an IPA that has had 40% of the water evaporated out of it. Generally, delicious!

2022's is harsher, as KT3418 has mentioned (although ""barleywine style"" is just a legal term for all barleywines...not an indication that it's not a real barleywine). The usual heat is just not balanced this year by enough syrupy sweetness. Disappointing but it's still one of the more awesome brews on the shelves.",4.22
Bigfoot,"Minimal head on a deep copper body. The aroma doesn't prepare for the taste, which is intense. A wonderfully bitter hop bite on a robust malt base, with a full mouthfeel. This will be great for cellaring!",4.44
Bigfoot,"I poured a 12 oz. Sierra Nevada Bigfoot into a pint glass. A cream colored head emerged above a beautiful red amber body that was impressively carbonated. Profuse lacing rose above a head that receded but never entirely disappeared. I have never been more impressed by a beers' look! The magic faded on the nose, however. Nice raspberry and bread notes were offset by a pungent hops note, which overrode the more pleasant components. The taste was a bit more amenable to enjoyment... the sweetness expected from a barleywine is there, and lingers a bit, but after a minute without a sip, the hops reasserts and again controls your senses. There is a sense of quality to this brew... the taste, look and feel of it are assertive, and if you are a true hophead, you might be enchanted with Sierra Nevada Bigfoot. I prefer to enjoy a barleywine that celerates its' fruited and grain characteristics. This is not that beer. The mouthfeel is quite good, I anguished a bit, that perhaps it deserved a 4.5. Overall, the taste and smell kill it for me, but I like dark, sweet beers. There are simply too many hops in the mix here for me, but I do believe it is a quality brew that will be cherished by hops lovers.",3.91
Bigfoot,"The 2022 edition is absolutely awful fresh. Tastes like an extremely malt-forward IPA. None of us could stand this. Hope it's better next time or with age. Did not taste like a barleywine, can't help but notice they just say barleywine style. Maybe I need to wait 10 years before opening one.",3.01
Bigfoot,"Opaque amber with orange reflections, the foam is compact and fine ocher in color. Scent of caramel, biscuit, date, citric hops but mainly resinous. Sweet, softly and sweetly malty entry, generously bitter finish on resinous and fresh paths despite two years from bottling. Medium and round body with fine low intensity carbonation. Few elements elegantly linked together. Delight.",4.35
Bigfoot,"Beginning in 2005 I've enjoyed each year of this release. It is perfectly rich, sweet and hoppy with deeply caramelized malts, firm and creamy. It has the signature SN central axis of taste that illuminates throughout their beers. Now 2021, I can finally cellar some bottles to enjoy and age for a few years. A beautiful American Barleywine that is world-class in it's style.
UPDATE as of April 7, 2022:
2021 release 12oz bottle pkg dated 12/10/2020 into a pint glass.
L: Pours a slightly clouded ruby burnished copper w/a thin creamy khaki head that dissipates to creamy edge foam. No visible carbonation. No lacing.
S: Roasted malt, caramelized malts, light earthy hops, a hind of biscuit. Moderate alcohol as the beer warms.
T: Gentle sharp hop bitterness, roasted malts followed by dates, citrus rind, sweet/tart hops, caramelized malts again then deep pine resin that goes fairly broad on the tongue. It's firm & lengthy hop bitterness results in a long resinous linger.
F: Lightly crisp, bold, firm, medium bodied mouth feel w/a drying long lingering finish.
O: This annual American Barleywine release I have is 16 months cellared and has a radiant taste of sweet malts and pine resin hops. It's toastiness & bitterness are expertly blended and it is outstanding and or world-class in it's style.
*The 2022 release has a bit more of a head, the body is clear burnished copper, aroma has berries and is a bit more citrusy, the taste is quite similar though bitterness is at the front rather than in the finish, it's feel is slightly slick. Overall it is fantastic.",4.6
Bigfoot,"12 oz bottles poured into snifters. Side by side tasting of the 2011 and 2014 vintages:
L - both are caramel colored with nice hazelnut heads that lingered. 2011 may be a shade darker, but really no noticeable difference
S - same, very slight scent, caramel and bread
T - caramel, sweet nuttiness. both are very nice, with both malt and hop flavors. 2014 is a bit silkier and more full bodied, 2011 seems to have more hop bitterness
F - thick mouthfeel, 2011 has a tad more carbonation feel to it
O - both are very nice, initially I prefer the 2014 vintage, it's a bit smoother and silkier",4.41

O - A solid pale ale. Not too hoppy, and well-balanced. A fantastic afternoon ale.",3.88
Dale's Pale Ale,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 5/26/22, into my spiegelau IPA glass.

On the pour a fluffy 2 finger head forms woth a good amount of fine carbonation rising from a light amber body with no haze. Very nice head retention on this one with just a half finger of head loss over the 5 minutes since I've poured. Head does become rocky but sticks around very nicely.

Aroma is more balanced than I remember with less hops jumping out at me than expected. The hops are surprisingly fruity with some tropical bright notes balanced by a nice sweet bready maltiness. Some slight fermentation sweetness is present on the nose but it's still quite a clean fermentation. Good but lighter aroma than expected.

Flavor carries some similar notes to the aroma, but loses a lot of the tropical vibes for a more traditional bittering hop flavor but there is a floral sweetness that merges very nicely with the very nice malty sweetness that this beer brings. The bitterness in this one comes after a the sweet hit on the front subsides but it remains a very balanced and quite sweet beer with some nice and present bitterness on the back.

The feel is easy drinking and refreshing while still letting you know it's there big body from the head retention and the malts even have a bready soft mouthfeel it seems. It's very balanced in this aspect as well.

Overall this beer honestly surprised me with how much I enjoyed it. The malty notes stood out while still maintaining a nice balanced hop presence. Quite a sweet beer which was honestly a bit of a surprise considering how similar this beer was to other IPAs it felt while drinking it in the past, but this is honestly an easy drinking beer that brings big but balanced flavor that I personally quite enjoy.",4.17
Dale's Pale Ale,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can I to a standard pint glass. Huge frothy “coke float” head on aggressive pour. Golden/light-amber clear color. Head dissipates slowly. Lacing is decent and a 1/4th finger head stays through half the drink before finishing with a film of bubbles.

S - Sweet malty scents. Some citrus scents as well. Light pine hops.

T - taste is more along the citrus and pine note. Slightly floral as well. Medium bitterness from the hops. Taste smooths out as you drink it and the malt characteristics return. It’s nice that some tastes are more hoppy while others are more malty.

F - Good frothy mouthfeel with decent carbonation.

O - This is a very solid everyday drinking beer. I’m not a hophead and prefer more malt-forward beers, so this carries a little more bitterness than I like, but it’s still a really good beer. The fact that the tastes go back and forth between malt and hop is an enjoyable experience. Would recommend.",3.77
Dale's Pale Ale,"This is a 12oz. can dumped into the Oskar Blues pint glass. This ale is a beautiful amber, very clear, with light but steady carbonation. one finger of white foam that hung around a lengthy time leaving thick lacing behind.
The aroma is maty from a distance, very noticeable, with the nose at the glass I get the pine aromas. Exactly what I hope for from a pale ale.
This ale is very pleasant, caramel, pine, and citrus. Sweet up front with a tangy, crisp finish.
The feel is smooth, light, and a bit fizzy.
This is an easy one to sample, but at 6.5% ABV it may sneak up on you after a few.",4.34
Dale's Pale Ale,"12oz can traded across the Pacific Ocean. Considering its journey, it's held up really well.

It's a burnished copper beer sitting in the glass with a thick, bright head that lingers throughout the glass.

Aroma is malty with strong, dank, piney hops. Very enticing!

Flavour is strongly bitter and caramel malty, with a citrus and piney hop body shining through. Finishes sweet, tangy and a little dry.

Mouthfeel is well carbonated and the tongue knows it's there, even after the swallow as the carbonic prickle lingers well after the swallow.

This is a great beer. I can imagine it would be awesome fresh at the source.

Cheers!",4.44

Feel: Decent mouthfeel, not too heavy and a good amount of carbonation, coats the mouth well
Overall: This is true to its style. Maybe a bit bitter for chugging on a hot day, but for sipping or mixing with foods that play off its fruitiness it would be ideal.
Pair with spicy foods, hard-wood grilled foods, BBQ sauce and aromatic cheeses like Stilton.",4.19
Dale's Pale Ale,19.2 oz can. Pours rich amber with a nice off white head and lots of small bubbles. On the nose you get the hops more than malt. The malt is hidden by the pale ale for the IPA crowd.

Dale's Pale Ale,"I had never tried Dale's Pale Ale until I moved to North Carolina only 14 miles from the Brevard brewery. I've seen it before, but the plain label made me think it was a generic pale ale. Boy, was I wrong. It's a 'hoppier' pale ale than I'm used to and, for me, is perfect as an everyday-anytime alternative to the heavier IPAs that I still love.

It's crisper than an average IPA and lighter.",4.64
Dale's Pale Ale,"So this was the last one of the IPA 16oz i tried from the local beer distributor. Why? Because of the plain label. I thought if they didn't put much time into the label, how good could it be. Well, it is actually better than alot of the others i tried. A little darker than the others, it is clean and crisp with a medium hop taste. Don't be fooled by the label like i was, worth trying.",4.09

It's okay. It's a beer. Not bad at all. Easy on the way down. A little lacking in all its flavors. I find myself wishing for something more.
I buy it because it's everywhere, literally everywhere, usually inexpensive, and because for all it lacks as a drinking beer, it is more than adequate for deglazing caramelized onions (5s across the board to caramelized onions). And then, when I'm done making caramelized onions, I still have 5 bottles of Blue Moon left, and I drink them between my usual picks (which are not as good for caramelizing onions), and I don't complain about them. Decent beer. Drinkable.",2.46

Blue Moon Belgian White,"Nice color and head as well as a good aroma for a Belgian white. The flavor, however, leaves more to be desired. Softly malty with just the slightest touch of clove and orange. Very summery and a decent introduction to the style, but I wish it were a bit more robust.",3.18
Blue Moon Belgian White,"Anyone who buys beer for social events knows that there are two choices: dirt cheap light beers that you drink not to enjoy, but to ""crush"", and higher quality inexpensive beers that still might not taste good, but leave your guests with the impression that you give at least half a damn about them. Blue Moon and its derivatives fall into the second category. This one, being the flagship beer of Blue Moon (read: Coors+), can be found in anywhere there is running water and electricity. I admit I've never smelled it because I don't want to be the guy at the party who freakin' smells a beer. The taste is mild wheat with a touch of sweetness. If I close my eyes and use my imagination I can make some citrus and spice appear. Not much besides breadiness, but it is a good breadiness. There is no industrial quality to it that you typically get from mass-produced beers. No complaints about the carbonation or mouthfeel. I might even say that I enjoyed it (a bit). Of all the wheat beers I've had, this is certainly one of them. It's hard to feel enthusiasm for a common wheat beer (it would be like getting excited over sliced bread), but for what it's worth, this is one of the better macrobrews.",3.5

Blue Moon Belgian White,"L - Poured from a 12 ounce can into a pilsner glass at around 55 degrees. Huge head on aggressive pour. Head slowly dissipates. No lacing to speak of. Hazy light golden color.

S - Citrus scent is font and center. I get a juicy scent as well. A little light grain malt. Sweetness on the back end.

T - Taste is much more subdued and less in-your-face citrus. The citrus scent is balanced out with the light hop flavors. Mild grain malts.

F - Mouthfeel is very good. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

O - Overall this is an enjoyable beer. It’s no wonder Blue Moon is so popular. To me this is one of the better beers for enjoying outdoors. Very refreshing, but has more to it than other macrobrews. I’ve somehow avoided this one for years, but I think this will be added to my summer and camping beer rotation.",3.45

Incredible value here if you can find it on sale. I paid less than a dollar-a-can, and for an impressive ~10% IPA that's no common feat. It drinks pretty good, just like budweiser, milluh, and what somma these otha' beers we got? But for real, it's smooth, overly hopped, pine and bitter and no taste of alcohol (just the burn in your gut) - or balance. Nothing outstanding here, just exceptionally well-done, solid, etc, insert your adjective here. Clear look, head that sticks around, doesn't smell like much besides hop pellets... Just buy this beer, it's worth it

Dangerously drinkable, indeed",3.49
Double Jack,"There was a time the quality of a brew with the Firestone Walker label went unchallenged. Recently, there have been rumors heard that may no longer be true. This investigation begins by pouring two 12 oz. cans into a clear glass liter mug. A pretty pour it is. The color is a bright and nearly translucent copper. Well carbonated, a small enduring head is joined by good glass lacing and noticed. Not pungent, there is a soft aroma of malt and hops around the glass. Wonderfully drinkable, this does everything a great DIPA should. It's malt forward is velvety, slightly sweet, perfectly carbonated and earthy the way only barley can deliver. At the finish, the hops rule the taste. Nicely complex, they are a little fruity and mostly piney at the finish. There is a taste contribution from the alcohol that isn't distracting and belongs within a good American Double IPA. So much for rumors.",4.44
Double Jack,"Appearance: Clear and golden-hued, slim, off-white head, long-lasting.

Aroma: Dank and pungent. Wide open and fuming with fruity and floral aromatics, crackling with hop bitterness. Citric fruits aplenty, with tropical, as well. Stone fruit, too. Orange and lemon meet mango and apricot. Lovely stuff.

Let's drink! That cornucopia of the aroma is plump on the palate, with hop bitterness hanging in close on the side. Just about perfect. Several ounces in, and the booze rises up. It sits happily in the mouth, and causes no fuss, just the general happy feelings we associate it with. Ah, yes. And, yum, yum.

Beautiful fruit, beautiful booze, beautiful bitterness. Mmm, yes. Soft mouthfeel, brilliant hoppy texture, long finish. How many ways do I love this wonderful beer? How many ways are there?",4.21

Aroma: Crushed pine needles, grapefruit rind, orange, sweetened strawberries, a little Cannabis, lemon, and malty notes that while present, hide quite well
Taste: Pine, citrus, berries, and dank come out swinging and all over top of a much more present sweet malt base, though make no mistake, hops are the standout frontrunner here. Near the finish, pine and citrus are again in the spotlight and closes with a great hop bite along with some sweetness
Mouthfeel: Big, full – almost viscous, a little slick, some alcohol heat, medium-high carbonation, and medium dryness on the finish
Overall: This is big, bold, and awesome stuff. A total throwback WCDIPA that is huge on pine and citrus along with being a full-feeling beer, has great dryness, and some booze heat that leaves no doubt it’s big. Fun to try this again after so many years of it being retired and nice to see [taste] it’s still a winner",4.35

Orange blossom, citrus, berry, floral, hop spice, pine, perceived light caramel.
Big aroma...explosive...maybe, almost.
Lots of the above aromas carrying through...so tasty in it's (mostly) traditional flavors.
Add some stone fruit flavor to the mix that wasn't present in the aroma...maybe even melon.
Medium body, bright entry and mouthfeel. Some heat in the long finish.
Drinkability is high and the strength is deceiving.
Outstanding.",4.27
Double Jack,"L: This Beer poured an amber, copper color with a nice frothy egg-shell colored head. Bubbles floated quickly to the top consistently throughout my entire time drinking the 12 oz can.

S: The smells flowing from this beer were very green and pine-y. I detected hints of citrus such as orange in the scent, with a very slight tinge of booze. The smell was extremely appetizing and made me excited to sip it.

T: As far as double IPA’s go, this tasted great. There was a nice initial tinge of orange with a delicious malty and biscuity flavor flowing over the tongue afterwards. It finishes with a long bitterness that plays on the tongue afterwards for several minutes. Personally, I couldn’t taste much of the alcohol if at all.

F: Mouth feel was great. Very full and hardy with decent carbonation that wasn’t so extreme that it harmed the experience. It definitely felt fun and full in the mouth, but not so heavy that it might have creeped into a creamy territory.

O: Overall a delicious double IPA that I would definitely consider buying a pack of. With 9.5 abv it definitely packs a punch, but the flavors are there to back it up. Great showing by Firestone Walker.",4.34
HopDevil,"Pours out an amber color with a nice thick head. The taste is somewhat fruity and truly different. Some notes of fruit, like blackberry or blueberry with a hoppy finish. All in all a great tasting beer.",4.05
HopDevil,"Tasty traditional IPA from Victory, this might be my favorite from the brewer. Great balance of hop bite and malt backbone. Would look for this fresh again.",4.1
HopDevil,"This beer pours a clear dark bronze color with significant effervescence and a moderate head that dissipated quite slowly . As expected, there is a strong, fresh, hoppy aroma. The taste is very pleasant; dry and hoppy with caramel undertones. The mouth feel is a bit syrupy, but still refreshing.",4.15
HopDevil,"Clear copper leaving a finger of off white head. Aromas of coffee, citrus, and bread. Taste is bold and spicy. Hints of citrus and toffee with a very strong malt backbone. Just a touch of hops and pine. This beer is full bodied and creamy. Nice feel. Overall this a quality offering from Victory. Just a touch too malty for my preference but a solid brew nonetheless",3.9
HopDevil,"This beer first appeared on my beer radar very early in the game. I didn't even drink yet. It was the summer before college, we were at a buddy’s house and all the Bud Lights were gone. So, my friend stole a Hop Devil out of the home owner’s basement fridge and proceeded to then hurl it across the room. Full beer went smash. Big mess. From that day on the Hop Devil has always been memorable. That being said, I never actually had one until this week. Like Sam Darnald who lurks in the background, it’s an average beer. Solid pine notes, not overwhelming, but a little heavy. Took a little while to get through, but overall OK.",3.41
HopDevil,"Clear copper, nice off white head, excellent retention, great lace. A good looking beer!
Grapefruit, pine, floral, caramelized honey aromas
Grapefruit and caramelized honey flavors
Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation
A real blast from the past. I've started to miss these old school East Coast IPAs.",4.31
HopDevil,"Pours amber with a 1"" cream-colored head, which fades to a wisp. Moderate lacing.

Aroma is citrus, toffee, hay, caramel.

Taste is grapefruit, pine, spice, caramel. Resinous.

Medium bodied, light carbonation. dry, resinous finish.

This is another good Victory IPA.",4.21
HopDevil,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.7%. Clear deep golden to amber to orange colour, moderate white head. Pleasant hoppy aroma, but not overwhelming. Hints of orange marmalade. The flavour is surprisingly well balanced and harmonious for something called ""HopDevil"" - hoppy of course, but no devil is at loose here, rather a benevolent HopAngel. Me like!",3.74
HopDevil,"Deep bronze color, good sized head and nice lacing. Citrus aroma with a distinct melon quality. Spicy hops dominate the flavor , but there is balance in the aftertaste. Medium bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel with an average length finish. This has been consistently well made over many years and remains a personal favorite.",4.2
HopDevil,"A go to of mine for years. A nice deep copper color with reasonable head and lacing. The mouth feel is as good as there is outside of NEIPAs. What makes this one special is its delivery of both malt and hop tastes. As it should be, the slightly sweet malt is up front, followed by a lingering earthy and hoppy finish. This is a really good IPA that I've been drinking regularly for years and I never tire of it.",4.44
HopDevil,"Appears, amber with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a nice cap and lacing.
Smells dank, citrusy, orange, grapefruit, piney.
Taste follows the nose and very hop forward.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall a very nice IPA that I would definitely want to drink again.",4.05
HopDevil,"I reviewed this beer about 18 years ago. One of the originals. One of the best in this style. The beer that put Victory on themap.

Copper color with great lacing. Dank hop smell with malt in the background. Slightly piney hops balanced with caramel malts. Still the best balanced. Nice bitter finish.

Still reaching for this quality beer after all these years.",4.68
HopDevil,"I liked this beers. An interesting mix of hops, earthiness, dank, not going for super floral and uber fruit, I'd like to have it again, it was in a mix pack, I remember being surprised.",4.34
HopDevil,"Cloudy copper on the pour, some head that dissipates quickly and lots of lacing. Aroma is very piney, with some fruit and malt. Taste is very hoppy with lingering bitterness as well. This is a very good IPA, but I'd rate some slightly better......like Bell's Two Hearted, Ithaca's Flower Power and Sculpin from Ballast.",4.17
Oberon,"PKG: 3/24/22 opened and reviewed on 6/12/22

Look: slight haze to the straw gold liquid. Puffy white foam rises high with fat clumps of lace.

Nose: Spicy, husky wheat and summer field golden grains. Spicy, herbal and fruity in the back.

Feel & Flavor: Very light and clean feel with a nice spice kick, herbal and soft with a tingle of light fruitiness.

Overall: I love that this is an American wheat bear sans the big Banana and Clove funkiness all over the place. This one represents clean wheat, grains and a herbal, slightly fruity hop thing that all jives together.",3.83
Oberon,"It can be quiet frustrating to drink a beer that feels like nothing. With Oberons in season, you're likely to find these things at graduation parties or summer barbeques. You can also find Two-Hearted Ale, Modelo, Pabst Blue Ribbon, and Corona at these occasions. Now is Oberon really better than these? No. Is it really worse? Well it can't be worse Heinekein or a Stella.",1.8
Oberon,"May 1, 2022 - Hazy straw color, fluffy white head, lacy; tastes like beer, pretty good beer, mouthfeel is good beer. I’ve never been particularly impressed by wheat beer but this one’s not too bad. I like the big fluffy head.",3.77
Oberon,"Canned 3/14/22.
Hazy yellow with one finger of white head.

Light banana and vague citrus aromas, with some bready/yeasty malt smell.

Taste is orange+lemon creamsicle, but less sweet , light dried banana, bread crust, finishing with some coriander+black pepper spiciness that has some bite to it.. Light lingering bitterness

Feel is light-medium, juicy, smooth, light-moderate very,very fine carbonation tingle. Finishes with sharp bite on tip of tongue, followed by a drying feeling.

Smooth and easy-drinking. A classic for good reason. :)",4.12
Oberon,"I have been looking for this for a while. I only just randomly found it at a World Market, cool. Poured from a bottle into a spiegelau American Wheat Beer glass.

Looks - Hazy golden honey color. Beautiful look to it. The head is nice, white, and fluffy. The head doesn't die out easily. Lacing is kind of minimal. If you look up beer clip art, this kind of has a classic beer look. Very attractive.

Smells - Kind of tangy. Like, I would expect this beer to be tangy. Mildly fruity (pineapple?) with some malt in there. A slight bit of vegetal spice in there too.

Taste - Very nice. Not too bitter, not too sweet. Cherry-like notes with some lemon-esque pineapple. Mild spice and peppercorn fruits. Malt in the middle as well, wheat is very prominent and gives a classic beer taste while also being varied enough in notes. A zing of bitterness in the finish. Finish isn't too long.

Feel - Pretty smooth, fairly light. Easy drinking. Not very effervescent. Doesn't coat the mouth too much. Highly sessionable. Smooth, fairly velvety.

Overall, I enjoy this one. It's different from other hop-foward ales I'm used to drinking. Has a nice hop to malt balance. I've been searching for beers in the American Wheat Ale style. My only other exposure is Little Sumpin. There is contention around LIttle Sumpin being an IPA or an American Wheat Ale. I tend to be on the side of it being an American Wheat Ale...but trying this has me changing my mind. This is stylistically different enough. Not as bitter as other ales, but not too sweet. This would be great at family parties.",4.06
Oberon,"A truly wonderful beer!
Beautiful golden color, a little hazy. Very nice head and wonderful full-bodied taste. A great summer beer and no fruit! A remarkable accomplishment, which I highly recommend. On top of everything else, it was reasonably priced.",4.63
Oberon,"draught
Nearly clear, medium light gold, in color. Nice fresh, yeasty, light malt aroma, with a little tang (herbal?). Pleasant, up front malted barley (wheat?) grain flavor, with a touch of spiced herbal hop nuance. My first Bell's beer tasted, and at their main taproom no less.",4.18
Speedway Stout,"One pint can poured into tulip.

Pours bible black with one fat finger of rich brown head that leaves some spiky lace as it recedes.

Smells of bitter chocolate, cold black coffee, dark caramel, toasted oatmeal, vanilla cookies, black licorice and campfire smoke.

Tastes of coffee fudge, caramel squares, toasted pecan and hazelnut, more roasted oats, unsweetened licorice, more vanilla shortbread cookies and smoky ash.

Feels huge and thick. Full bodied with creamy carbonation. Finishes chewy.

Verdict: Vigorously recommended. A feast of a beer, perfect for watching a long movie on a chilly night.",4.42
Speedway Stout,"Pours a pitch-black coloration with a large, creamy, mocha-colored head. Smells of roasted, caramel malt and coffee and chocolate, as well as lighter dark fruit and hints of licorice and tobacco. Taste is an excellent balance of roasted, caramel malt and distinct coffe and dark chocolate, as well as some dark fruit, with notes of fig and plum, and hints of licorice, tobacco and herbal, bitter hops. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and tobacco lingerin in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and low/medium carbonation.

This makes for a very enjoyable coffee stout with distinct, but not overdone chocolate, coffee and dark fruit notes, while I suspect that a lot of the chocolate and dark fruit comes from the coffee as well as the malts. At the same time, there's a very good roasted and bitter presence to this as well, with some roasted malts and herbal hops, which is just the kind of flavor profile that I'm looking for from a beer like this. It's very well-balanced, with some lightly sweet notes from the dark fruit and caramel malt, as well as more roasted malt and bitter, herbal hops, as well as hints of licorice and tobacco. Also, the ABV is hardly noticeable here, with this drinking very smooth, with a great body and mouthfeel.",4.42
Speedway Stout,"Poured from a 16 ounce can into a snifter.

Look- Black, visible particulate at the margins, medium brown frothy head, above average head retention and lacing.

Smell- Cocoa, coffee, roasted oats, fig.

Taste- Predominately coffee, toasted oats, slightly cocoa.

Feel- Medium body, silky, moderately bitter, slightly below average carbonation, mildly mouth coating.

Overall- Predominately coffee flavored stout that was thinner than I would have expected, but still very satisfying.",4.26
Speedway Stout,"16 oz can, born on 12/17/21, poured into a snifter at 55 degrees F:
L - dark and oily with a hazelnut head that lingered around the edges
S - coffee, chocolate, roasted malt
T - dark and bitter, coffee, chocolate
F - medium mouthfeel and minimal carbonation
O - very good stout, dry and bitter with lots of flavor",4.5
Speedway Stout,"Look: Dark black with dark brown head. Left a small amount of lacing on the glass.
Smell: Huge roasted malt, bitter coffee, dark chocolate.
Taste: Follows the nose and is actually amazing. This is my new favourite non BA stout out there. The 12% abv is completely undetectable and the coffee is subtle and just adds to the flavour of the roasted malt. The malt profile is awesome and this is one of the most impressive beers I've had in a long time. Huge roasted malt, mild bitter coffee, and mild dark chocolate complement each other so well.
Feel: Thick and full. This is a chewing beer for sure. The 12% abv works wonders for the mouthfeel.

Overall: You have to try this at least once. People either like it or love it a lot, and I'm among the latter.",4.83
Speedway Stout,"Wow, this is something special. I've been trying to get to Alesmith whenever I am in San Diego (for 10 years), and just found out they moved to Mirimar area. So I made the trip over. They have a dozen special so on tap this day and I am able to even try Bourbon Barrel Speedway Stout too! This is not a sweet beer. And I like them that way (Roasted, Toasted, and bitter). And now they have this at my local Total Wine as well. Stouts are my favorite variety, and this goes near the top. They have a taco truck that stays outside the brewpub on some days. I have no idea, but something in this beer knocks me on my a$$. Great stuff!",4.48
Speedway Stout,"Look: Poured from a pint can - Black nova pour with light foaming. A bit of lacing on the side of this as it's glued to the glass. Can't see anything inside if it has carbonation rising to the top.
Smell: Instantly after pouring I got hints of rich chocolate, banana's, a hint of coffee, big malts. BIG.
Taste: Wow! I felt I got hints of a chocolatey banana mix along with a coffee after taste. I'm still not over how they managed to make this taste chocolatey and banana-ey at the same time.
Feel: Medium bodied - not to much carbonation. Easy sipper to drink.
Overall: I loved it! I wasn't expecting it to be as smooth as it was as usually coffee stouts are medium to coffee dominant. This one doesn't seem to be the case. It seems to be the opposite bringing out the flavors of chocolate, banana (even though not listed on the bottle), malts and then the after taste of the coffee. Good job! Two thumbs way high.",4.92
Speedway Stout,"Bottled in a big bomber and purchased from Cafe Beermoth
Pours a jet black body with big thick tan head
Aroma is good filter mocha’d up
Flavour is coffee can irished up",4.25
Speedway Stout,"The smell is good, coffee and chocolate as expected, but not as strong as I would like.
The flavor is kind of sharp, as in one or two notes overpower a little and you can’t pick up what else is going on. Taste is okay, but definitely a little bitter for me, especially the finish. The aftertaste, after the bitterness leaves, is good, with the chocolate malts and coffee coming through.
It’s a fine beer, but I was kind of expecting it to be a little better.",4.08
Speedway Stout,"Pours black with tan brown head. Smell chocolate, coffee, roast. Not too bitter, thick, creamy, chocolate, caramel. Well balanced, fills your mouth with flavor, more as it warms. Can't taste 12%. Well done.",4.89
Speedway Stout,"Holy banana. I swear they use bananas in the brewing process. It’s a super odd beer. I prefer just the flat Guinness. I doubt I would buy this stout, it was a gift. Still, the 12% abv is great. Good sipping stout after a dinner.",4.31
Speedway Stout,"I will have this again at the temp I prefer, right now I'm forced into having it colder than it should be. Head was huge, canned in 2019, site says it ages well...I think it does actually but I really need to try at the recommended temp. Coffee and roasted malt are still pretty present though.


After having it fresh on tap I generally agree with my previous sentiment but I'm not mindblown at all and have 1000% had better or stouts I'd prefer more.",3.79
Speedway Stout,"Black body with a tan head. Decent lacing. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and some vanilla. Taste is slightly sweet , consisting of bitter chocolate , coffee and malts up front. Slight lingering burn on the tongue. Mouthfeel is creamy smooth with just the right amount of oiliness and weight. Just about perfect. An excellent stout!",4.41
Speedway Stout,"4pk purchased Feb, 2021. Two cans cellared for about 12 months. Always refrigerated. Pours jet black. Tasting tannins, heavily roasted malts, bourbon, hops, toffee, dark fruits, figs & plums, strong black coffee, light char, brandy, chocolate, a hint of tobacco, very deep flavors and a long finish. Full flavored and coating. Incredible!! in it's style.",4.44
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Poured very dark brown and capped with an ambitious light brown head that climbed three inches very quickly.
The aroma to my chemically damaged nose was mild but still featured proper porter smells- roasted malts, coffee, a touch of chocolate.
The taste- I grabbed the can again to verify, but vanilla plays top position. Not sweet at all, but no mistaking there is vanilla in here. Coffee shows up later, this drinks true as it warmed.
The feel was good, ideal even. Not sure if it could be better. Ideally viscous.
OA- very happy to have been able to try this finally!",4.44
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,If you've ever wondered what could make a great porter even better it is notes of vanilla. This beer has a rich coffee flavor and a satisfyingly vanilla aftertaste. Color is dark and consistency is very smooth. It's a shame I can't buy it in Texas.,4.97
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,Can pour- dark as night with foamy khaki head leaving frosty/foamy lacing and a ring of bubbles. Nose is vanilla and coffee for days. Taste follows with some roasty malt and mild espresso bitterness. Vanilla lingers on the finish. Tasty.,4.43
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"2021 release from can. Poured from fridge temp. Pours black with a really good amount of light brown head. Sticks around for quite a while as well. Nose is incredible. Vanilla, marshmallow, coffee, dark chocolate, red licorice, burnt toffee, and a nice amount of dark fruit. The taste nicely follows the nose, but with a distinct bitterness on the back end. Vanilla and coffee (very dark) are dominant. Definitely some charred wood, black licorice, roasted malts, almonds, and tar. Not sweet at all. Mouthfeel is fairly thick. Overall a really nice coffee stout.",4.21
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"After being impressed by the High West BA version of this a few weeks ago I figured I'd give this a shot. Quite affordable at $3 for a single bottle given it currently sits at #323 of all time on this site

Pours a very dark brown with just a finger of espresso colored head that quickly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing and decent legs

The aroma here is sweet but not overly so, bringing a nice balance of vanilla, hazelnut, toast, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee, and a slight dark fruit note

A bittersweet balance is maintained throughout the entire sip, starting off with notes of cocoa powder, lightly toasted malt, raisin, and a touch of grain alcohol. The swallow makes this one a bit sweeter, bringing notes of rich vanilla, slightly astringent coffee, milk chocolate, and almond

A medium silky body pairs with gentle carbonation for a smooth slow sipper. The finish is mostly dry, due to the roasty character of the coffee

Damn delicious beer right here. It hits all the notes expected and doesn't feel overly sweet or strong despite the high abv. I'd definitely get it again",4.37
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Yesss!
Well, you might hate it - or you might love it!
My wife didn’t like it but I did. Even though I’m not so fond of Porters or Stouts but THIS ONE, I’m telling you was really good!
Vanilla and coffee. Vanilla is really present in the aroma, sweet, but like some cookies or sweets or a kind of a cake? Very pleasant. And its taste is just as good as it smells!!! This isn’t always the case, as I’m sure you must have observed that beers often smell “better” than they taste - but this one was astounding. Sweet but not syrupy, sweet like vanilla sugar. Coffee? Not 100% sure I could decipher it, but maybe overall the thing tasted like drinking a Starbucks latte with vanilla added on top? Oh yes, don’t forget about its booziness, which isn’t harsh at all, rather makes the whole thing taste and feel like an Irish coffee.
This was the first that I had of this kind but it made me curious, I think I might seek more of such coffee or vanilla or oatmeal-infused Porters or Stouts out. Worth giving it a try!",4.87
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Initially: robust/strong taste. After several months of sampling Porters and Stouts, Victory at Sea sat AFRAID in the corner of the refrigerator...reattemped tonight; world class favorite!",4.79
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Smells like a starchy vanilla espresso. Tastes like one too almost, though the coffee is more pronounced and it almost has a dark chocolate taste. A good unique beer, though the smell is a bit too much for my preference.",4.02
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Notes from 2/25/2020.
On tap at the Draft House in Austin and served in a 5oz snifter.
The appearance is dark brown with a thin tan ring of foam around the rim. 3.75
The aroma is medium in strength and of delicious chocolate covered caramel, and a little salt. How can a beer smell this good?! 4.75
The taste is moderately strong with chocolate covered caramel, roasted malt, boose, and a moderately bitter finish. 3.75
The mouth feel is above medium in thickness with moderate carbonation. 3.75
Overall, it's very good but it's not quite my thing. I think it's how the bitterness mixes with the flavor. 3.75",3.99
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Ballast Point scores a home run with this big and bold imperial porter. The smell of vanilla greets you pleasantly and invitingly, not overpowering as your first sip brings you beautiful flavor notes of coffee and smoky marshmallow maltiness. This is an amazing porter- one of my favorites. Drinking this on a cold winter day - this beer is nearly perfect. I discovered this beer last year at a St. Patrick’s Day parade when I stopped at a local tavern and it made for a great day!",4.83
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Dark golden brown color with tan cap and lacing.

Aroma at first of something like coconut, quickly followed by a vanilla laced light coffee which reminds me of a Kenya bean rather than something more robust from some other part of the World. Very clean and pleasant.

Taste is more coffeeish than coconut with some elements of roasted malt yet it's restrained. Again coconut blends with vanilla but that's just my perception. That all sounds rather sweet but the brew doesn't come across as sweet in the taste as it does in the scent. It finishes clean and dry.

Medium texture with balancing carbonation.

Overall it's a refreshing take on the Porter/Stout style, very drinkable.",3.93
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Bottle from Albertson's. Wow, just wow. Black gold. Chocolate and coffee,slick and oily. Campfire, burnt toast and coffee. Molasses, yum....and the vanilla for a little bit of marshmallow",4.41
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"This is my first time trying this beer and it doesnt dissapoint. Very dark, i would have thought it to be a stout. The vanilla smells hits you instantly followed by coffee and some roasted malt. The taste follows the nose to a tee, with the vanilla hitting first then the cofffe and malts backing it up. All in all this is the best porter I've ever had.",4.5
Victory At Sea - Coffee And Vanilla,"Ignoring the recent sale of Ballast Point to Kings and Convicts brewery, this is A GREAT imperial Porter! Their brewer notes description are right on for this. Notes of vanilla... Not to sweet.... low acidity.... Coffee comes through..... All flavors balanced so well! From bottle, an early Christmas present from my DW!",4.71
Traditional Lager,"On tap at Diamonds Billiards Cape Coral, Fl
Looks copperish, smell was nothing noteworthy. Taste was typical of an American lager, this too, not noteworthy. Feel was fine, slight carbonation. Overall, got this because the bar had lesser choices, Bud Light and the like. Not downing this, if it’s the only option, go for it.",3.23
Traditional Lager,"A staple in early NY beer bars which was smart - one of the original cross-over beers for the fizzy yellow beer crowd.
The fact that it was ""local"" meaning close enough for NYers that they had some idea where PA was helped make it popular and that it was innocuous in terms of flavor didn't hurt, so the main reservation back then was "" it was a dark beer"". The horror!
Well, we have come a long way baby. And Yuengling continues to be both a staple every day beer for some and a ""corny"" cross-over beer for newbs.
Amber to reddish brown in color it pops a white head that falls quick and leaves little trace behind.
Aroma is corn flakes with a hint of honey - usually over carbonated so there is a gassy staleness on draft any way.
Flavor is mildly caramelly and faintly hoppy with a tiny bite of back end bitterness.
Finish is slightly sweet with a lingering soggy frosted flakes aftertaste.
It's East coast Fat Tire but been around a lot longer.",3.3
Traditional Lager,"Crystal clear. Minimal head with little lacing. With vigorous swirling the head livens up, fine bubble with a very creamy look. Still falls quickly.

Nose is estery, like fresh apples. Some roasty toast or mild biscuit, a bit of DMS. Pretty much the standard ""beer"" smell. Nothing offensive, nothing really nice.

Taste is a bit less pleasant. Mild and indistinct hoppiness. Esters are less apparent on the palate. Some oxidative quality, slightly stale and cardboardy. Some corny flavor, perhaps DMS. Moderate biscuity flavor in the mid palate, which is kind of nice. The finish is almost soapy, and a bit too sweet. Aftertaste is biscuit, floral (probably what I'm perceiving as soapy), and caramelly cardboard.

Mouthfeel is OK. Light and moderately refreshing, but a bit thin and watery. If the finish was dry, rather than cloying, then it would be much nicer.


It's mostly inoffensive. I'd probably rather have a Shiner or a Ziegenbock, if I'm going for this style of beer (and I can't say I ever am, outside of palate exploration). I wouldn't refuse one, at least.",2.7
Traditional Lager,"Because America! Fuck yeah!

If you get a tingle in your balls when the national anthem plays, get goosebumps when you see the flag, or still get an erection when a bald eagle flies over…this beer is for you.

It’s not a perfect lager, but my friends, neither are we as a country. However, this lager represents a melting pot of freedom. An opportunity, in-spite of humble beginnings, to make anything of yourself. It represents an idea. An idea that in this great country you are free to drink anything you can dream of or brew it.

Happy Fourth of July Gentlemen, and God Bless America!",3.87
Traditional Lager,"Yuengling Traditional Lager bottle at refrigerator temperature. Yuengling Traditional Lager looks good, and is one of a bunch of middle-of-the-road east coast ambers including Brooklyn Lager, Blue Point Toasted Lager. Traditional Lager is OK, but lacking in malt body. To me it is similar to Dos Equis Amber in style and quality. It's good enough in a pinch.",3.05
Traditional Lager,"Highly preferred over the BMC ( and their light versions too.) . This beer has more malty flavor than other macro adjuncts and is very easy to drink. This beer is tasty and cheap enough to be a fridge filler , give to your visitors and not have to apologize for it. Most bars and restaurants have it too. Not much smell and a little thin, but it delivers some malty sweetness with only a hint of bitterness. A very solid beer.",3.19
Traditional Lager,"12 oz can into a pint glass. Clear amber color with a foamy off-white head. Smells of sweet caramel malt and adjunct filler. Mildly sweet caramel malt carries through in the flavor but is accompanied by an unwelcome metallic aftertaste. Medium-light bodied. As far as mass-appeal beers go, you could do far worse.",3.42
Traditional Lager,"Maybe i am late to the party but this a solid beer the color is nice , smell is ok taste is good i think for my Oklahoma standards, just got to get it from Texas for it. Sure in the hell beats Budwieser at least for me. Drink local have fun .",3.87
Traditional Lager,"While I enjoy expensive, unique beers as much as the next guy. I can’t lie when I say that when it’s super hot I go for a lager over a IPA/stout/etc. This beer is cheap, and it’s very very good for a lager. While it’s not the most amazing beer you can get, you can usually find a 6 pack for 10 or less and that’s commendable for how good this beer actually is

It tastes really subdued for a beer but not super subdued like Bud Light

Smell is alright, nothing special

Feel is nice, very refreshing

In a bottle it look ok, In a glass it’s a very nice color, almost no head though

One of my favorites",3.67
Traditional Lager,"A beer everyone can agree on. It's extremely affordable (2 for $4 tallboys) and is more than passable: it's simply good. Standard beer taste, a little malty and sweet. Not watery, not skunky. Nice body and enjoyable, refreshing taste.",3.53
Traditional Lager,This is a macro I truly enjoy drinking. I love its light malty sweetness and have always found it refreshing and very drinkable. I'll buy this any time I see it... which is very unoften due to distro area.,3.92

Doesn’t look or smell impressive, but delivers a decent approximation of a historical US lager.
Yeah, there’s some corn, it’s too sweet, and it should be livelier, but there’s some deep malts, real lager leanness and more than enough hops to clean it up.
For a wide distro supermarket $7-a-six-pack lager, this has far more character than you’re paying for.

Often the best option in craft-unfriendly places, and that’s fine.",4.03
Traditional Lager,"picked up a 32 oz, usually fresher in my area, as with alot of these mass produced beers... the big boy bottles tend to be fresher. had this on draft, in a can, in a bottle, too many times. average fizzy beer no lacing no head retention. def think they use porterine to color this one.

Edit: This beer can shine if poured right. if you do that classic numbskull no head to the tippy top pour, this is one of the most carbonated wet stale cardboard beers youll ever neck down. If you exude some testicular fortitude and confidence, youll direct pour the sumbitch right into your oversized 500 ml pilsner urquell mug, gettin a nice big ol spongey white head with plenty of lace. So the 32 OZ brown quart glass bottles carry the unspoiled malt flavor much better. the green bottle 12 oz is just more aesthetically pleasing, but i drink through the eyes of a blind man. what would this review be without the home row keys and that little bump underneath the f and j? htrhetureturehtrehjkghadlkfghirt. This score will reflect a direct pour from 32 oz brown glass, since im not a bartender and cant be pissed to ask the tender to do let her rip, let it sit, and come back to it in a few minutes for that slow pour german style. then again the poor girl is also trying to swat the barflies and fruit flies that you will absolutely see in any bar serving this classic baby on draft.",3.08
Milk Stout,"Look: It may just be me, but, I think stouts are always the best looking beers so it’s always gonna be a 5

Smell: Chocolate, coffee, smells like one of those Starbucks nitro shot things

Taste: Like a mocha coffee, sweet, this is one of the best tasting beers. But he warned, it’s very sweet

Feel: Lingers a bit too long imo, but still very nice

Overall: This is a damn good stout. I’m so glad my local liquor store has this. Highly recommend.",4.58
Milk Stout,"I poured a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass. A one inch head melted into a thin sheet within minutes, but still provided moderate lacing. The aroma is quite pleasant. chocolate, roasted barley, coffee, milk, and a vanilla-like sweetness prevail. The resultant effect bears a faint barrel-aged resemblance. The taste is about what you expect from the nose. The roasted barley blends well with moderate hops, and the milk sweetens the chocolatey stout. I expected a stickier consistency, but the mouthfeel is nicely balanced... the taste and feel is quite clean and refreshing, compared to a typical stout. I find Left Hand Milk Stout a compelling choice among dark, sweet stouts on the market, and The 6% ABV is right on target for what I desired from this brew.",4.07
Milk Stout,"Nothing about the look and smell really stands out as a major pro or con. Where it excels is taste and feel as it really lends itself to my personal preferences. I don’t like overly fizzy beers and this stout is about as watery as they come, while still maintaining a coffee and milk flavor (tastes like a plain latte).",4.5

Sweeter than Guinness.
My highest rating so far on BA. I know that’s not saying a lot but still, impresses.",4.33
Milk Stout,"I bought a glass bottle of this at my local liquor store and drank it from a shaker pint. I found it to be dry for a milk stout, which is generally fine by me as I'm not a huge fan of sweetness in beer. I thought it tasted more of fig than coffee or chocolate. I'd definitely drink it again.",3.77
Milk Stout,I prefer other American stouts but this at least met expectations and I'd absolutely have this again. The flavors are there I just know you can find them in other places more intensely. Definitely worth a try especially if new to the style,4.0
Milk Stout,"2. rerate, 355 ml bottle, as Left Hand Milk Stout Nitro, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.0%. Black colour, low and creamy beige head. Dryish roasty aroma, notes of coffee, hints of woodwork, cocoa and liquorice. Low carbonation. Medium dry and very roasty flavour with a little lactose sweetness present, notes of strong coffee, a little dark chocolate and liquorice. Should not be drunk ice cold, cellar temperature is better. 1. rerate, 12 fl. oz. bottle, bought at the GBBF 2008 for takeaway (forgot that I had rated it previously). ABV was said to be 5.0%. Dark brown colour, nearly black, nice and lasting tan head. Notes of aroma: same as first time. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. The flavour has still plenty of roasted malts and lactose sweetness, also notes of chocolate, mild coffee and some liquorice. Good stuff - I’m upping it a few points. Original rating: Sampled bottle, RBNAG 2007 in Grimstad. Dark brown to black colour. Nice roasty aroma, notes of cocoa, hints of liquorice. Moderately sweet flavour, plenty of maltiness (probably also lactose).",3.75
Milk Stout,"12 oz bottle poured into a stout glass. Pours black, opaque with a tan head that falls to a cap. Smell is coffee, cocoa, roast malt. Taste is sweet chocolate, coffee and cream on entry. Middle is where sweet gets evened out as hop bitterness creeps in. You get a bit of earthiness from the hops too, but again, everything is well balanced. Finish is roast, nuts, and a bit of cocoa. Feel is medium bodied, smooth and creamy. Low, tight carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent beer with a ton of flavor that drinks easy.",4.04
Milk Stout,"Appearance: Pours a nearly completely black color with a soft, tan head. SRM of 24. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of chocolate and cream upfront. There is also a velvety, cherry, and licorice note. Not much coffee or roast. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of velvety, rich chocolate, There are some underlying red velvet and red & black cherry notes here too. Mild roast and minimal coffee here. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Minimal bitterness and roast so allows it to lean malty. (3.75)

Compared to Firestone Walker's Nitro Merlin Milk Stout 1/10/21: Pours a similar color with a darker head. More cherry licorice on the aroma. Less coffee roast. Maybe slightly less bitterrness from the roast, but since it's not nitro doesn't feel as smooth. I mislabeled the two in a blind taste test.

Overall: A pretty nice and easy drinking milk stout. I get some hints of red velvet, cherry, licorice. But overall minimal coffee and roast here. Appropriate sweetness, but the minimal roast allows it to finish slightly malty and fairly easy-drinking at 6%. (Final Rating: 3.85, the flavor helps it here with the rich cherry-chocolate flavor)",3.85
Union Jack IPA,"Dirty gold in color, clear with slight chill haze that goes away, white head with nice retention and some lace.

A slightly tropical big dose of orange citrus and rind, with a hefty dose of sappy pine.

Medium body, the hops bite you on the tongue, super resiny dry and crisp bite of high bitterness, like eating a pine needle.

Union Jack IPA,"A - Lovely pour, crystal clear pale orange body, white head, fading to a thin line whisp. Fine lines of lacing.

S - Strong note of hops, a bit of pine, thin sharp resin and mild fruit.

T - Nice, bright fruit open, undefined citrus, a hint of pineapple comes with a solid malt middle, and a present, bitter bite in the close.

M - Prickly carbonation, slightly light weight, very, very clean finish.

O - Subtle, tasty IPA, well-designed and so very crisp and clean. Good stuff.",4.21
Union Jack IPA,"Pours copper color and creates a decent little white head. Nose is ignites the salivary glands at first inhale. Piney and citrusy fill the nostrils. Taste is not as bitter as I imagined, however there are hints of resinous goodness through the full taste profile. Very good IPA, but those words do not give it justice.",4.32
Union Jack IPA,"This is a typical West Coast IPA, that's for sure. I got more of the piney flavor than anything else, but there are a few different hops in here for sure. I didn't really get the mellow honey-like flavor that the description promised because of the amount of hops in there. If you like IPAs you'll surely like this one, but this is not my favorite style, so I tried it because I wanted to see if it was worth all the fuss. It's good, but not my thing.",3.84

F: A little too thick for my preference. Definitely resinous but I don't think it's as dry as others.
O: A solid beer. I think I prefer some of the other Jacks that FW makes, but if I'm really angling for a West Coast IPA it surely ranks among the best available in PA.",3.94

Smell: Citrusy, mild sweetness.

Taste: Nice citrus bitterness with honeyed bread malt body. Finishes with a lasting bitterness, delicious!

This is a very good west coast IPA.",4.5
Union Jack IPA,"Poured into a Nonic.

Pours a slightly chill-hazed medium gold with a decent head and excellent lacing.

Quite a range of aromas. Grapefruit, tropical fruit, caramel malts meet floral, grassy, and piney aromas.

Definitely West Coast, yet still rather well balanced, thanks to a proper start. Caramel malt and honey-kissed graham cracker on the tip of the tongue quickly gives way to grapefruit bitterness, which evolves quickly into a resin-fest in the mid palate, before that surrenders to a more delicate, restrained floral/grassy bitterness at the finish that hints at the deceptive bitterness that comes from a wild clover honey.

Medium bodied, but well carbonated. Has a nice, relatively short and drying finish.

Firestone Walker is not available in the Dakotas, so glad to have grabbed some of this one while in Illinois. This is a badass WCIPA.",4.25

S: Orange, tangerine, pineapple, berries, sweet malt. Rather floral.
T: Hop forward. Tangerine, pineapple, pine, cedar, spicy hops, black tea, grassy light crackery malt. Moderate pine lingers in the finish though it is not intense.
F: Mouthfeel is clean, brisk and medium-full bodied and is mildly assertive. It is a little bit dry and has a medium-long finish.
O: Overall a very crisp, well balanced clean, hop-forward beer that drinks very easily and is quite accessible to a wide variety of palates. It has a bit of a bitter edge but is not over the top. It is excellent in it's style of West Coast IPAs.",4.19

Oatmeal Stout,"Absolutely superb. Poured into a pint glass at 52F. Pours the deepest dark cherry; almost black with a finger of khaki head which dissipates down to a ring with an island that sticks around. Smell is rich caramel and chocolate. Taste is caramel, chocolate, plum, with delicious creaminess. Somewhat dry and bitter finish that gives off coffee and toffee. This beer has some complex character with a low ABV. Great carbonation and perfectly balanced. Not too sweet, not too bitter, and the taste morphs and develops with each sip; the changes with temperature are epic and delightful! Couldn't ask for a better oatmeal stout! Highly recommend!",5.0
Oatmeal Stout,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

The look it almost black when held up to light, only letting a little through and revealing its true dark brown nature. A one finger head forms, but it fades to a fine cap pretty quick. Lacing forms right off the bat however.

The smell is quite rich with a dark chocolate/coffee note, with some yeasty dried fruit notes as well. Sort of like Guinness but sweeter and more pungent. Has the signature ""sam Smith smell"" as well. Not sure what makes their beers so unique but all their dark Ales have that characteristic, but.its hard to decribe.

Taste follows the smell with malts being the main event here. Not very fruity in flavor until the aftertaste. Lots of coffee undertones as well. Beers flavor is not as sweet, but still has that sam Smith signature sweetness with it. One of my favorite stouts out there.

Feel is rich and creamy with just enough carbonation bite to keep it balanced. Each sip is very smooth and almost velvety. Not super heavy though although it can seem that way at first.

Overall a delicious traditional oatmeal stout. Not americanized and really not hoppy at all, going more into roasty sweetness and focusing on mouthfeel and drinkability. Very good rich and malty.",4.25
Oatmeal Stout,"Pours a deep and ruddy brown out of the bottle, resulting in an opaque body that borders on black when poured into a typical pint glass. A tight and creamy one finger thick head appears — over the next little while it collapses into a thick off-white cap that persists throughout. Thick lines of lace dot the glass throughout.

Wow, such delightful aromas of chocolate! For a stout that is not advertised as such, nor has any additives in that way, nor any ‘chocolate’ malts, it has a deep and rich cacao note on the nose. Caramel, toffee, moist cake aromas here as well, along with some toasted wheat. Very sweet character

Surprisingly silky smooth sip, the flavours following the nose but bringing out more of the oat character, which gives the beer a thicker body and a twang of bitterness. Though it is not as bitter as you might expect, not from any hop bitterness or any burnt/roasted malt bitterness. There is just a touch to balance out the sweetness. It is lighter than expected as well, which allows the sweetness to mix without being too cloying. Chocolate, roasted caramel malt flavours dominate here. There is a gentle dark fruit flavour such as dark cherries you may notice on some sips. Some coffee on the front of the tongue but it fades quickly.

Silky smooth body, the carbonation is lower and only gently pricks at your tongue, giving this a supremely smooth and creamy taste. It is medium bodied, lighter than you’d expect, and the finish is not as dry as advertised. A very gentle, subtle finish that leaves only a hint of chocolate, malt, and cacao beans in your mouth.

Surprised by this beer, I would say it’s more subtle than you’d think. For an oatmeal stout, it definitely goes for balance compared to many others. With all that said, if you expect a typical strong roasted/almost burnt malt taste with strong oatmeal character and an oily body with unique bitterness, you will be disappointed here. If you’re looking for an easy drinking stout, this is great. If you’re looking for a stout with chocolate flavours that isn’t overwhelming like some chocolate stouts or a chocolate stout without lactose, this is an excellent choice.

Overall it’s quite an excellent beer and absolutely has its place. I am glad I got two, as this is definitely an enjoyable beer you could knock more than a few back through the night.",3.94
Oatmeal Stout,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured an opaque dark with no head and no lace. The scent had roast malt notes. The taste was nicely balanced and easy to drink with roast and coffee presence. The mouthfeel was lighter in body with good carbonation. Overall it is a great beer.",4.04
Oatmeal Stout,"As the label clearly states ""The Celebrated Oatmeal Stout""...

Poured a full four finger tan head right up to the rim of the pilsner glass. Very sweet malt notes on the nose, almost like a fresh bran muffin. Not quite as opaque and dark as the Samuel Smith Taddy Porter in the glass.

Just enough malt sweetness on the palate, like a really rich barley soup, full flavored without being overwhelming. Retains a little sweetness, whatever hops used are also light and sweet on the aftertaste. Perfect balanced flavor.

Body exactly right, slightly oily weight, not too thin not too heavy.

As close to a perfect Stout as I have ever had. Been revisiting old favorites and finding myself pleasantly surprised how well many have held up over the years. There's only a tiny handful of beers I give a perfect score to, and this is one of them. In fact, if I was forced to only have one brand and type of beer the rest of my life, I would choose this one. Richer and sweeter than Guinness, this one stout ticks all the boxes for me. No negatives, all positives, right down to the ABV... It lingers on the palate, with the complexity of a good single malt scotch. If I haven't been clear I really really like this beer.",5.0
Oatmeal Stout,"Quality beer that pours a dark brown with a thick head. After trying the Samuel Smith Chocolate Stout, this one was a disappointment. A bitter hop flavor, it's not nearly as refreshing as the chocolate counterpart. I've had better Oatmeal Stouts, but you could do much worse. I'd probably never get it again at the price point",3.89
Oatmeal Stout,"Deep dark brown body, rapidly forming a solid, thick, mocha head, fine and with great retention.
Fruity chocolate aroma - cassis, blackberry, black cherry - not so much roasty or rich, and even lightly floral.
The taste follows suit, with fruity cocoa notes of dark fruit, acidic, with a bittersweet tang of espresso; medium light body and carbonation, verging on watery, although the oats, a bit of residual sugars, and a powdery feel help give it some substance; the semi-dry finish is long, with more roasty chocolate coming through, but still accompanied by distinct fruitiness.

Not what I expected, one of the fruitier stouts I've tried, nevermind one that isn't deliberately incorporating fruit flavours, and lacking body. In the end, it's enjoyable, and probably more so if you know what to expect.
Edit - what I tasted is so far off other reviews, my batch is potentially off",3.6
Oatmeal Stout,"I bought a bottle at the LCBO in Ontario 550ml at 5%. Poured a 2finger creamy head into pint glass.
The smell was very nice coffee and chocolate malts .
Taste was very smooth and creamy oatmeal with a hint of toffee and coffee just sipping on it
Overall this oatmeal stout is very enjoyable to drink leaving a lace all the way down but it feels stronger then 5%
Good beer
Cheers",3.88
Oatmeal Stout,"Looks like a stout should, and pours a nice thick tan head into a pint glass. Aromas are not as pronounced as some others maybe, but what is there very nice. The taste is excellent, with expected roasted malts beng the star. Nearly perfect balance and feel. One of the best stouts IMO, when you don't want any added fruits, coffee, etc. Perfect brew for a cool damp November evening. Every stout lover should know this world-class beer as a reference for the benchmark.",4.52
Oatmeal Stout,"It's an absolute classic. Bubbling, thick and rocky tan head. Coffee and toffee on the nose.

Alpha King,"Look: It pours copper with an off white head. Head retention is excellent.

Smell: There are citrus aromas up front with some caramel. There are some pine notes in support with dried apricot notes.

Taste: It has a definitive malt presence with caramel and citrus. The balance is nearly even with a slight tilt towards the hops. In addition there are pine and dried apricots.

Feel: It has a medium body with strong bitterness in the finish without being harsh.

Overall, a very good pale ale that is slightly balanced towards the hops.",4.07
Alpha King,"No canned on date…
Appearance: Pours a dark orange copper, almost red in color. About a finger of white-yellow foam with good head retention and lacing down the glass. Translucent, but I think that is a more due to the color, there isn’t any floating sediment.
Smell: Initial notes of pine and bready caramel malts with a subtle sweetness. Notes of apricot and tangerine are also present. Prevailing sweetness is present from the middle to the back with caramel, rye bread, and slight toffee malts.

Taste: Bitter hops on the front end with pine, grapefruit, and orange rind that adds to the prevailing sweetness. I also get hints of apricot, tangerine, pineapple, and maybe some mango. Caramel and bready malt profile provides a solid back bone with a bit of rye spiciness on the back end.

Feel: Medium carbonation gives the smooth mouth feel and enhances the malt profile and flavors. Thicker than I remember and maybe that is because it is slightly older. Minimal alcohol warmness and overall enjoyable.

Overall: I think this beer is a bit on the older side, but certainly hasn’t gone bad. Malt flavors are a bit more pronounced, and the edge of the hops is taken off slightly but still enjoyable. Classic beer with great hops and beautiful supporting malt backbone. Always happy to enjoy this beer and I will definitely keep buying it.",4.46

Smells of slightly dank piney grassy hops with some citrus.

Tastes of hops and malt first followed by slightly tart citrus with a slightly bitter finish.

Smell - a balance of dried fruits, malts, and some sweet/syrupy notes. some hops also present, mostly pine and a bit of citrus. this is a complex one.

Taste - the taste is as complex as the smell. hop forward, but only moderately so. smoothed out by a wave of malts and syrup like sweetness. the hops come back in the end and leaves behind a long and slightly sweet finish - the kind typical of an exemplary IPA or hoppy ale.

Feel - medium bodied, average carbonation, and moderate in ABV at 6.66%.

Overall - for a flagship beer, this is remarkably complex and pretty damn tasty.",4.26

Initial taste of sweet malt and then an explosion of flavor from burnt toast, dark chocolate, oak and bitter black licorice lingering on the finish. This is a huge taste bomb with various layers. The high ABV is somewhat hidden. Moderate-light body with fine carbonation. Slightly slick with a lingering stickiness on the lips. Although I expected a slightly thicker brew, the overall feel is quite good. Sip this slowly and roll it around on the tongue to get the best experience. I would definitely buy this again.",4.43

Black Chocolate Stout,"Appearance:
A full, two fingers of creamed froth the color of burnished beige that laces in slippery webs. This voluptuous head retains only a few moments before being swallowed up by the glossy blackness below.

Bouquet:
Smoked barley and charred baker’s chocolate are engulfed in a tremendous whirlpool of dark malts. As it airs, the barley and malts take a backseat as tremendous dark chocolate emerges from its charry cocoon, bold and unmitigated.

Feel:
The very definition of a stout: dense and full-bodied. Carbonation shows restraint, content with becoming lost in a warm, boozy, woodsmoke linger.

Taste:
Copious quantities of scrumptious, bitter black chocolate, subsumed by an avalanche of booze-drenched dark grains and black bread suffused with charcoal smoke.",4.54

Smells really inviting. Nice dark chocolate with tons of roasted notes and some light vanilla sweetness.
Taste follows the nose. This is an awesome flavour profile. Dark chocolate, roasted malt, vanilla, caramel, some coffee on the back, and 0 alcohol so this one’s a bit dangerous.
The mouthfeel is sadly kind of thin. Not super full bodied like what I expected for a big stout but it doesn’t ruin the experience. Carbonation is light and the finish is smooth and dry.

Ayinger Celebrator,"From the bottle in a snifter. This legend pours a dark blackish brown with a
fantastic head of khaki foam that settles to a thick ring, thick clumping layer,
and sports some very nice lacing. Nose of coffee, brown sugars, raisin, subtle
cherry, dates, and dark breaded malts. Flavors give it their all with dark raisin
bread, coffee, brown sugars, cherry, and perfect toasted malts. Nice mouth feel;
medium body, medium light carbonation, smooth, lightly coating, and finishing
lightly sweet with a balanced malt note dashed with subtle hops.

Overall----a legend for a reason!

Can't believe I hadn't reviewed this one.....a classic!

Ayinger Celebrator,"A wonderful, complex dopplebock
with a rich brown-red color, chocolate undertones and a bread scent that is pleasant.Pairs very well with the Buffalo Stew at Tommy’s Joynt in San Francisco. One of the little plastic goats you get on the bottle has hung from the steering column of every car I have ever owned.",5.0

Ayinger Celebrator,"poured from a 330mL bottle into a willi becher pint glass. pours a fairly dark brown with almost three fingers of wet sand-colored foam. dark fruits, rye bread, hints of coffee even and some toasted malts. it’s robust and smells like a big beer, which i suppose it kind of is. a huge malt presence in the taste coupled with dark rye bread, raisins and coffee. this is not quite a sipper but it’s not refreshing or drinkable either. it’s rich, full and hearty. packed to the brim with flavor. a full, malty mouthfeel with a lower level of carbonation. this is a real treat. certainly far from a daily drinker but it’s easy enough to take down a small bottle or even 2 if the mood struck. really enjoyed this one and it’s been far too long since i’ve had this offering.",4.45
Ayinger Celebrator,"Appearance: Pours a mildly clear (40% clarity), dark amber to brown color with a strong tan head. SRM of 19.

Aroma: Initially, strong bready aromas stand out upfront. Among them some chocolate notes. Hints of licorice, dark fruit, and caramel to support.

Flavor: Strong flavors of dark bread upfront. A strong dark bread yeast is present that gives a bit of bubblegum and bread spice. After this, getting more licorice, roasted black malt before a chocolate and caramel sweet malt finish off the end.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finish is malty, but relatively dry for the ABV. A bread spice and chocolate flavor linger.

Overall: A fantastic doppelbock. Honestly I haven't had a doppelbock that wasn't fanatastic. This one nails the flavors and probably leans more bready than the others, but hard to tell. Exactly what a doppelbock should be. Should probably compare to others to see if this one is truly better. (Rating: 4.23)",4.23
Ayinger Celebrator,"L: Pours a deep brown head with ruby undertones. Tan head has good retention.

S: Rich, toasted malts dominate with a bit of spice and dark fruits.

Glass: 0.5L Ayinger Pokal
Serving Temp: approx. 50 degrees F


Look: Deep and opaque chestnut brown. I cannot see even my fingers thru the glass even when held up to a light. 3"" tan head that fills the glass from the the 0.5L mark to the rim. The head lasts a fairly long time and persists as a 0.25"" cover even after I start drinking the beer. Good lacing down the sides of the glass

Smell: Deep and rich malts. Fresh baked whole grain dark bread such as pumpernickel. Dark cocoa.

Taste: Rich malts with toasted pumpernickel bread. Chocolate and cocoa. Some raisin with hints of anise. Finishes on a dry note.

Feel: Smooth and rich. Mouth-coating. Medium body.

Overall: An excellent doppelbock that deserves its world class reputation. The dark bread and chocolate notes, along with the dry (but not bitter) finish, are exactly what I look to find in doppelbocks. Very nice on a cool evening in Lent or in the fall.",4.03
Ayinger Celebrator,On tap in Wisconsin. Just what I want in this style. Very smooth and drinkable with some sneaky alcohol. Went great with my meal. Had this a couple times and will choose it again.,4.42
Ayinger Celebrator,"Very dark, opaque, almost black, with a garnet tinge around the edges, and two fingers of light brown head that dissipates quickly - to be expected given the 6.7% ABV. The smell is rich and powerfully malty, with sweet dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, dark bread, and beef broth. The taste mostly follows the nose, but is not quite as strong, which I found slightly disappointing, but at the same time makes this beer more drinkable - almost dangerously so. The warming spirit alcohol is noticeable but unobtrusive, and wouldn't slow you down all that much from necking this stuff if you didn't know better. Overall an intense, complex, rewarding beer -in other words, par for the course for a Doppelbock, and another home run from Ayinger.",4.33
Ayinger Celebrator,"Pours deep ruby with an enormous khaki head, which sticks around, and leaves quite a bit of lacing all the way down to the bottom.

Rich malty goodness on the nose. Almost a bit like beef consomme as well, which actually follows through on the palate. Good fresh baked brown bread.

Entry is semisweet, complex. The malt, the brown bread, that faintly meaty beefy note I always associate with bock style.

Feels good and heavy, just this side of overpowering I would say. Really stays with you, without that overhopped bitterness some bock, doppel or otherwise, can have. A real mouthfiller...

Overall this may be the ideal doppelbock, perfect expression of the style. I've been going back and reviewing a lot of old favorites, and I'm about to branch out into some of the more modern expressions, so I'm thinking of beers like this as setting the standard. This Ayinger has got a bit of a potent ABV, not so much as a Belgian ale or a modern IPA, but combined with that lingering aftertaste, makes for a pretty satisfying bottle. And I also think something should be said for the label, which may be the coolest label of any beer I can think of right now... Two goats (two goats get it?) rampantly celebrating a pretty large footed, dimpled glass of doppelbock... Truth in advertising! Putting this one up at the top rank with Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout as maybe the ideal expression of a variety.

As a side note, I'm old enough to remember when American Brewers like Pabst and Yuengling used to put out their seasonal spring bocks; in fact my grandfather used to bring a case or two of the Yuengling bock back in the trunk of his Galaxie, from our Easter trips to Pennsylvania, which was right around the time they seemed to release these beers back in the day. I remember the steel cans of Pabst Bock with the goats head on them...",4.94
Ayinger Celebrator,"Pours very nicely, about an inch and a half head that dissipates quickly but leaves a lot of lacing. Looks very nice in the glass! It’s almost black, like a deep blood red but more opaque than some ruby red beers (like Guinness, which is a bit clearer)

The smell is malty and coffee like, with a bit of fruit, reminds me of dried cherries covered in dark chocolate. Taste is very complex, smooth and malty at first, like toasty graham crackers but evolves over time into a mild spicy flavourful mix of mild fruits, raisins, caramel. Very savoury beer! The mouthfeel isn’t exceptional but by no means bad, it’s very smooth with low carbonation — I think I got an older bottle.

It tastes how you want a beer to taste when you hear it’s a world class, complex beer. Some folks say it doesn’t linger on the tongue, but my experience was completely opposite. An exceptional double bock, with the caveat that I’m just getting back into beer and haven’t had many double bocks, it’s excellent amongst all beers I’ve tried!",4.24

Ayinger Celebrator,"The general consensus seems to be that this one is the best of the Doppelbochs and it's hard to dispute. From the first pour to the finish it is a first class treat. Clear, extra dark brown appearance and large tan head with moderate lacing. Complex aroma of cinnamon graham crackers, caramel, toasted malts and dark fruit.

Ayinger Celebrator,"Bottled 7/20/21

Alright, time to knock out another style topper! This one is always being discussed on the forums, but I can never seem to find it near me. Luckily when I stopped in Half Time the other day, they had some relatively fresh bottles, so I knew I had to pick it up. Let’s crack it open and see if it earns its title

Pours a very dark brown with 3 fingers of light brown head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s just straight up malty goodness in the nose here. I’m picking up on aromas of dark bready malt, toast, raisin, toffee, brown sugar, sweet caramel, and molasses

It’s pretty similar in taste, but it takes on a bit more of an aggressive taste. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting red grape, dark toast, herbal hops, apple skin, toffee, sweet cocoa, and a touch of smoke. The swallow brings notes of dark toast, molasses, burnt sugar, raisin, smoke, and herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a a rich beer. Finishes off dry

Punkin Ale,"Punkin Ale brewed by Dogfish Head Craft Brewery, with an ABV of 7.00% This Pumpkin Beer pours out of a glass bottle into a pint beer glass. The color is a deep golden amber color with a nice white head. There is also a nice amount of lacing to this brew, it sticks to the side of the glass well. The smell is Rich with Pumpkin an Spices. Some of the spices are cinnamon pumpkin nutmeg an others. You also pick up a nice amount of grains an malts in the small as well. So far Punkin Ale is a nice inviting brew. Now for the taste, it is Bold with pumpkin spice , really puts you in that pumpkin pie state of mind. Not saying that is a bad thing. If you are a fan of pumpkin pie this brew is a must. Just the right amount of spicy, pumpkin mix. There is nothing overpowering about this pumpkin ale, it has a super nice balance to it.

Punkin Ale,"Appearance:
Pure, translucent amber with a finger of off-white fizz that bolts quicker than a politician faced with a lie detector.

Bouquet:
Stale gourd husk with a cinnamon stick lodged up its buttocks far enough to be considered “distant.” The sad introduction is a forgivable offense because, as it airs, it exudes a mild aroma of sweet yams baked in butter and warming, fall spices.

Feel:
A slick yet girthy medium distinguished by fine, champagne bubbles and a comfy, long-lingered, pumpkin finish.

Taste:
Like being lured into a cozy, life-sized gingerbread house by the scent of fresh pumpkin pie… only to be knocked senseless by a cannibal witch with a tire iron: Starts with pumpkin pie filling on a gingerbread pie crust that’s abruptly interrupted by a savagely acrid, burnt copper aftertaste. This unwanted assault slowly desists as the beer airs but d@mned if it ain’t a horrible first impression… blegh.

Budweiser,"Budweiser is a solid American lager. For what it is - a crisp, light, simple beer, it’s excellent.

It’s best enjoyed cold and fresh, with its natural carbonation and mild beechwood finish and glorious light gold color and mild head. Folks complaining that it’s not like their good ol’ German beer or hazy mega-juice buttsmacker IPA aren’t wrong that it’s not a beer with a heavy body or distinct taste palate.

Budweiser,"Last beer I reviewed was an exquisite, delicate Pilsner that paired insanely well with a good pizza. The boys over at Weihenstephaner sure know how to do the right balance of complex and nuanced flavors, along with a nice delicate, simple beer that is worthy of their brand.

With my reviews, I've mostly been doing beers I love or like, so my reviews are skewed in that way, but today I review a beer that I feel isn't all that great, and that's Anheuser-Busch's beer, Budweiser.

COLOR:

Light and clear golden color. It does look pretty good when poured right. The head fizzles out and dies though, which should be an indication of what I should expect.

AROMA:

Smells tart and cheap. I got a weird, funky skunk smell. Just smells bad.

BODY AND PALATE:

It has the memory of a lager. All of the classic flavors are there, they're just incredibly thinned out. This tastes as if you wanted a beer and somebody shouted the classic lager flavor profile from another room. It tastes cheap.

Add some corn syrup taste and feel to this and you basically have a Budweiser. I love me a good Pilsner and a nice, refreshing lager, but this is definitely not the King of the Beers. More like a serf.

FINISH:

The finish isn't too bad, and not out of the ordinary for a typical lager finish. And I guess that's sorta the problem, isn't it? Nothing really stands out and intrigues your palate.

CONCLUSION:

This is nothing but dorm room beer. It's cheap, it's readily available, and for playing drinking games it has its place. But now that I'm 32 years old, I'm not after quantity, I want a nice, quality beer, and this beer just tastes like water to me.

This beer basically took those classic and delicate flavors of pale lagers and Pilsners that people love, and thinned them out, because they're after mass production and not a nice, refreshing, quality beer at the end of the day.

Overall, it gets a 2.5/10 for me. It tastes like the MEMORY of a lager or Pilsner, and is only good if you've just reached drinking age, you don't have a lot of money, and all you give a shit about is getting shit-hammered.",1.59
Budweiser,"""Best by 10/6/22""; drank 7/8/22 @ the Yarchives.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Fresh bread, mild raspberry & faint caramel flavors.

I'm stunned by how much I enjoyed this; my beer budget is about to plummet!!",4.35
Budweiser,"It’s hot dogs and brats on the grill, fireworks and a Bud!

I assume I’ve had a Bud before, but the last time was at least 40 years ago (probably longer). And I have no specific memory of it amongst a sea of similar beers.

The 4th of July seemed to me to be as good a time as any to give it a proper tasting.

I reduced the temp of my smaller beer ‘fridge specifically for this beer. The ‘fridge was at about 38°F when I removed the beer. The beer was at about 40° when I started tasting.

Clear, pale yellow, lightly carbonated body topped with a tall white head, thick and creamy-looking with retention on the short side of moderate. Nice looking for the style.

Pleasant, if weak, aroma. Malty with hints of sweetness. No complexity, but still nice.

Light flavor of malts. Smooth in the beginning, and remaining such throughout. Some (but very little) bittering appears in the late middle and carries through to the finish. As with the aroma, no complexity, but still enjoyable. The aftertaste is mild and lightly malty with slight bittering. The overall taste is just a little on the sweet side. The finish and aftertaste are more malty than crisp, ending, again, just on the sweet side. (The slight sweetness of Budweiser is apparently one of the differentiating factors – according to other reviews – from the other top-selling AALs, but I like it.)

The mouth feel is thin, decent carbonation feel, and surprisingly creamy (in a light sort of way).

Overall, I am surprised that I am enjoying this beer as much as I am. In flavor and in body, it certainly beats the heck out of the plethora of light/Lite® brands from these macro brewers.

One additional comment: unlike some other macro lagers – and even some non-macro lighter lagers, this beer does not develop off-flavors as it warms. It remains pretty much as it started.

NB: The following rating is with style in mind, but it also is a fair reflection of my enjoyment of this beer. Imagine that. I think I'll crack a second!",3.43
Budweiser,"Bud was the very first beer my friend gave me, years ago. It was warm and probably past it’s expiration. I didn’t even finish it before throwing up.

Now I know what I like and enjoy exploring different beers and saw the tall-boy cans of Budweiser for sale on the 4th of July with the word “FREEDOM” inscribed on the front. I decided I should revisit this for the sake of knowing what it actually tastes like. Surprise! -it’s not as horrible as the beer aficionados claim. Neutral flavor of very mild hops, malt, and sweetness from the rice. No off-putting flavors or aftertaste. Clean and refreshing. It’s not something that one drinks to contemplate life’s mysteries, but maybe just to stare into a camp fire or watch the stars. It’s good enough to cool you from the heat of your bbq grill. I will say that I had some *ahem* bathroom problems later that I can’t help but attribute to this beer… but overall I cannot bring myself to look down on Budweiser any longer.",3.74
Budweiser,"Picked up a case of bud cans today. Maybe it’s the special summer “freedom” marketing that gets me, I don’t know. This beer pours perfectly, golden with a glorious white head. Smell and taste are slightly crisp like green apple cider, not too heavy, not too sweet. It goes down smooth and I actively want to chug it. This is a Beer I long ago dismissed but now I think I might just be a bud man like my father was.",5.0
Budweiser,"I just had to write this.I am an IPA fanboy who hits all the taprooms around the city.I hopped on BeerAdvocate to read up on Budweiset.
I tried a Budweiser tallboy because 5% abv around a pool in the summer makes more sense than my 7.2% IPA.
It ain't that bad,geekheads.And you should know that because we ALL drank Bud at some point of our lives.It's not your local's pilsener/lager that costs twice as much,but it is a decent brewski for sitting with friends.And for all of you reviewers that keep talking about corn this and corn that...Bud uses rice,not corn, as the adjunct,so shut up already.I can't drink Busch because of that corn;Bud doesn't have that problem.
Bud has a neutral,but pleasant taste.Doesn't smell like much of anything.Goes down smooth and easy.
I prefer IPAs,but I am not ashamed to drink this.And neither should you be.",3.14

Budweiser,"Waaaaaaaaay too many beer snobs in here like they are reviewing a fine French wine. It's beer ffs. Get over yourselves. I ascribe to the German proverb that there are no bad beers....some are just better than others. I drink very high end stuff, and then I drink this. Beer Advocate peeps are obviously partial to IPAs. That's cool..I like them too, but I really get sick of them too and want something simple like Bud or a Naragansset. I don't know why I bother reading the reviews on here. Very predictable. If there were blind taste tests, the reviews would be different. Drink what you like. Cheers!",4.91
Budweiser,"Poured from a 16oz can into my weizen glass. Best before 5-14-22

On the pour a giant head forms even on an average pour 3 plus fingers but it quickly recedes to just a ring of larger bubbles around the rim and a few pods of bubbles floating on top

Aroma is tart and largely smells of cheap lager. Some BO notes not great and not a lot of malt either just off. And this is still a month before the best before. Bad.

Taste follows the smell but brings notes of corn. Still mostly tart water fermentation character. Some buscuity malt aftertaste but that fades to the taste of popcorn kernels. No bitterness, just fermentation, BO and grain. Still not a lot of flavor though.

Feel is crisp and easy to put down with a lot of carbonation bite for the style this is perfectly acceptable. Not overly watery on the sip but it doesn't stick around long. Not the best.

Overall perfectly drinkable and pretty predictable. Seems like it moves quick everywhere so it's not too risky if you can deal with the standard off flavors. Certainly not a standout, and I wouldn't reccomend pouring this in a glass.",2.65
Budweiser,"Well, it’s Bud. Not going to do a classic review here because it’s not that type of beer, but just write out some thoughts.

Syrupy taste with that classic, macro malt liquor skunkiness that has that weird savoury oily character. A little bit of bready character, a bitterness that is more metallic twang than hoppy, and you have a classic adjunct lager.

I am neither a proponent nor hater of this beer. I think snobs will always despise any macro lager and sometimes even the people who drink it. On the other side, people love to say ‘dude for a lawn mowing beer it’s what you want dude’ (not sure how lawnmowing became that de-facto go to for this) but I tend to be unpersuaded by that. For the price, while it is cheaper than some craft and ‘craft-macros’, you can find absolutely comparable priced beer that doesn’t taste terrible. In any style as well, lager, Pilsner, IPA, even German styles. Unsurprising with how tight the market is, plenty of beers without any adjuncts at all are out there for the same price.

So, if you like Budweiser, just say ‘Hey, I like this’. Who cares? You can enjoy any beer without needing to justify it, really. I was slightly surprised drinking this that it wasn’t as bad as some have described, and it’s not exactly unpleasant. The syrupy skunky character gives a taste in the mouth sort of like slightly pungent, off tasting cheese, but that’s about the worst of it. Though I am always surprised I tend to be like +10 to +20% on these ratings for the ‘bad beers’. I don’t think Bud outright fails which would put it below a 2.5 for any of the rankings, but hey. Like I said earlier — a preference is a preference and it’s okay to enjoy or dislike something!",2.49
DirtWolf,"Golden, foggy body. Lacy head. Smell is pine, pineapple, moderately sweet, slightly floral and lemony. Taste is tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, dank pine, more floral notes, honey, and lemon. Pretty nice balance between the pine and the tropical sweetness, with a nice malty finish. The bottle has a BB date of feb 4, so maybe it’s not as crisp as a fresh one. Still, really a good beer.",4.02
DirtWolf,"Appearance: Crystal clear amber-gold, large white head, good lacing.
Aroma: Pilsner malt underpinning supports the fruity, resinous hops that follow.
Taste: Flip flops the order noted in the aroma. Hops more dominant, flush with pine and tropical fruit.
Mouthfeel: Finishes with enough maltiness to keep things interesting and refreshing while still hop-centric.
Overall: Lingering and lasting, well carbonated, full bodied.",4.34
DirtWolf,"Rich orange color, decent head, strongly alcoholic, sweet malt base and - most importantly to me - an earthy, piney rush of flavor that balances out and eventually overwhelms the citrus and floral tastes that I find so unappealing in all but the very best IPAs.
I understand why many who appreciate the hazy and flowery side of aledom don't like it much, but it's just up my alley and is my go-to on weekend afternoons when I have no responsibilities.",4.43
DirtWolf,Bottle pour - deep golden honey color with thick white head leaving significant foamy/frosty lacing. Nose is earthy and floral with hints of citrus and pine. Taste follows with a malty backbone and lingering bitterness on a dryish finish.,4.12
DirtWolf,"Another boring beer masquerading as an IPA. Flavorful, but not with hops. Not bitter, smooth, but ultimately unsatisfying and difficult to identify its ingredients. I don't get the hype.",3.61

DirtWolf,"Th beer is a pale straw color but with a decent white head. It is clear. On the nose, rose notes and bitter herbal notes are present. Maybe its the label art, but it smells like a pine forest. On the palate , it is nice a bitter. the same hops notes from before are present but with citrus as well. The malt is there an similar to white beard with some whole wheat flour mixed in. The hops dominate the taste though expect for the finish but before the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is foamy but the body isn't great. The bubbles aren't pointed. Overall, a good well hoped IPA.",4.01
DirtWolf,"It smells bright and hoppy with a bit more of an alcohol taste than your average IPA.

The taste is a little sweet up front with a little maltiness but it soon gives way to a strong hoppy grapefruit with subtle notes of orange, orange zest, orange spritz or orange oil, lemon, lemon juice, lemonade, pithy lemon rind, lemon peel, lemon zest, lemon oil, tangerine, citrus, tropical fruit including but not limited to pineapple, mango, star anise, kumquat, not coconut but guava, passion fruit, jackfruit, pomegranate, cherimoya, rambutan, persimmon, a lot of apples, I'm no apple expert but the kind of apples they use for pies also golden delicious, red delicious, granny Smith, pink lady, fuji, honeycrisp and other apples, apple peel, peaches, nectarine, kiwi, banana chips, crab apples which although aren't edible but you can taste them and spit them out, elements of graphite, barbed wire, quick drying cement, pine but not just any pine, Douglas fir, red pine, longleaf pine, Virginia pine, pine tar, pitch, sap, and possibly hops.

The mouthfeel is light with a lot of fizz. It finishes clean and bitter and follows the nose?

In all seriousness overall this is an exceptional IPA. Besides the smell the alcohol doesn't really come through. I give it a solid 5.5 out of 6.",4.6
DirtWolf,"Excellent clarity in a yellow-orange beer showcasing active carbonation that feeds a 2 finger pillowy stark white head. Layers of lace cling to the glass with each sip. Juicy pine, grapefruit, and resin highlight a well rounded aroma profile. Bold but not too aggressive, almost a savory hop profile. It's juicy up front, grapefruit and resinous in the middle and then it finishes with a zesty pine. There is a an aggressiveness to the finish and a lingering boldly hoppy aftertaste. The body stays on the lighter side, somehow making for an almost refreshing sip and making this as dangerously drinkable as it is sipable. Really good selection from Victory here.",4.27
DirtWolf,"Dank Dank Dank. Piney and very hoppy but it defines the term dank, and in a good way. Drink this one by itself. No food pairings just sip, swish, savor and swallow. After you appreciate all that then open another to wash down your Beef, Ribs , Mexican etc. It will stand up to them all. But you owe it to yourself to enjoy that first one by itself.
Best DIPA that is easy to find.",4.92
DirtWolf,"Clear, bright golden coloring, lush white, long-lasting head. Lookin' fine. That ain't no lie.

Aroma: honey-sweet, tropical fruit bitter. Citra? Mosaic? Another hot hop I haven't thought of? Nicely balanced, plenty of hop flavor, little bitterness.

Taste: Hop bitterness right away, gliding the palate, stays calm and cool. Modicum of sweetness strokes the tongue, bumps up against bitterness, and the slide together down the throat. Malt body is medium-ish, light, not getting in the way of the hops. Alcohol isn't felt, but hinted at. Oh, wait, there it is…

Dirt Wolf isn't a pretty name, but I assume it has links to the lore of hops. Before I check the label to see for sure, I will add my final thoughts. This is right on the money, delicious, balanced double IPA that perfectly fits the mold set by Bell's HopSlam. It's a good formula that's proven popular. And easy to market: ""Can't find any HopSlam? Think HopSlam's too expensive? Try this, it's just as good!"" I almost wrote ""almost"", but, really, it's just as good.

Not a tongue-ripper, not a palate-destroyer, just a nice, hoppy pleaser, with an onset of alcohol. mmm, hmm.",4.16
DirtWolf,"I'm a local and it is my ""go-to "" IPA. Good citrus, nice smell of grapefruit, and a bit of pine but what I really like is the smooth mouthfeel. The 8.7% alcohol content is accurate and makes me feel ""comfortable"" after a glass but helps with the enjoyable experience. It is an excellent Imperial IPA.",4.2
Three Philosophers,"L - Poured from a 16 oz. can into an oversized wine glass. Pours a dark brown with reddish hue in the light. Has a tan one finger head. Head quickly dissipates to a ring. Had definite clear alcohol “legs.”

S - Scents start with light malts before dark fruits. Some booziness at 9.7% ABV. A little sugar scent.

T - The dark fruit and specifically cherry flavors are front and center. The alcohol is up front too. A little more bourbon like.

F - Mouthfeel is medium, and carbonation is cola-like.

O - Overall, this is a quality beer that I recommend trying out. It’s higher ABV is very apparent while drinking and for that reason I don’t think I’ll add it to my regular rotation. Also the cherry flavoring sounds good in theory, but I don’t prefer it in practice. I enjoy other straight-forward Belgian Quadrupels more than this one.",3.98
Three Philosophers,"Opaque reddish brown (colorblind, so best guess) with plenty of sediment. Thick off-white head that dissipates quickly with no real lacing to speak of.

The aroma is rich, tend towards cherry, and dark dried fruits. Sugar, burnt sugar. Moist earth, loam, and wet wood. Cola. Phenolic spice. Buried in there is a creamy oatmeal like aroma, trending towards nutty (like steel cut oats with almond milk). There's also a bit of cocoa powder hanging around the edges.

Taste is faithful to the aroma, just bigger and more intense. It leans heavily toward cola, even having a similar lingering sweet bitterness. It's almost bourbon like (Knob Creek), but too chocolatey and bitter to do more than insinuate a connection. The finish is rather prune like, and slowly fades to a lingering bitterness of hops and cocoa powder. Alcohol is apparent, but in a pleasant way (again, like with a good bourbon). As it warms, you get more fermentation funk (in a good way), and malty sweetness.


There is a lot going on here. Each sip is different as it warms. It's like a journey in a glass, and it's well worth taking. Delicious beer.",4.68
Three Philosophers,"The pour and the head is spectacular and very aggressive (quite a head; don't over pour or you're sure to waste some). The aroma of that first pour, especially into a chilled/frozen standard beer glass, is not to be missed. Everything there on out is just as enjoyable right up until you have to decide: ""Shall I have another?""",5.0
Three Philosophers,"Pours the typical plum color with a tan head, it looks like a quadruple or a strong ale. Smells like cinnamon, raisins, with a whiff of alcohol. Tastes like cinnamon, raisins, sugar, malty, with a little burn. Not quite as good as the Belgian standards but it’s a tasty beer and has it’s own personality, cheers!",4.35
Three Philosophers,"Surprisingly (to me), the head is short and very short-lived, despite as vigorous a pour as I could manage in the small 250ml chalice. While it lasts (look quickly), the head is a light tan color and bubbly. It quickly shrinks into sparse islands (and, then, also fairly quickly, disappears altogether), leaving a tea-like appearance. Dark reddish-brown from the front becomes a hazy bright ruby with a backlight. Active carbonation (also short-lived, though) rises to cause the islands to swirl around a bit. The color is great looking. Unfortunately, that is all that is great about the look.

Nice aroma, strong at first (I picked it up as soon as I cracked the can) but becomes pretty weak once the head is gone. I had to swizzle it to get a good whiff. Dark fruit, sweet candy, cherries. (Since I could tease an nice aroma with a swizzle, I didn't penalize the ""smell"" rating due to the limitation of the head - that was taken care of in the ""look"" rating.)

The flavor is very nice. Dark fruit, of course, sweet sugary candy, cherries-slightly tart. Spicy - coriander, perhaps some clove. No bittering. The middle exposes a malty foundation lending some needed gravitas to the beer. The interplay of the flavors never actually blends, but they do play off of each other very nicely. This is an excellent-tasting sipping beer, with lots going on in the flavor to keep me interested. The alcohol comes through into the flavor at the ~⅓-point of the beer and lingers through the remaining time. The finish is - oddly - a blend of sweet and dry. The candy bringing the sweet, and the cherries bringing the tart-dry.

The body is thinner than I expected for such a strong beer, and the feel is flat despite the initially active carbonation (which, as I mentioned above, seems to have disappeared along with the head). The feel ends up being a bit annoying (that is, for a flavor that is so great, there is a feel is so meh).

Overall, this beer might have among the widest variation among my rating of the individual elements (3.25 to 4.5), but the ones that count the most are the highest, so overall, it ends up at a weighted rating of 4.19. But, somehow, a bit of a disappointing 4.19.",4.19
Three Philosophers,Intro description is pretty accurate. Heavy on the dark dried fruit. Feel and head is abbey style. Not a go to beer but def worth indulging. Seems a good winter holiday selection.,4.74
Three Philosophers,"Hazy light brown body, with a fizzy head. Smell is deep and sweet; roasted malt, caramel, raspberry, pepper, hints of spice and esters, a bit of chocolate. Taste is also fairly sweet; immediately comes the spice, with coriander, and pepper; orange peel and citrus too, followed by a strong malty backbone. The kriek comes out on the finish, with cherry and raspberry that add a sweet balance to the upfront spice. Fairly high carbonation, and the ABV is quite noticeable. This is bigger than I expected, and while I very much enjoy the complexity it comes off a tad unbalanced.",4.08
Three Philosophers,"Three Philosophers pours a medium, cloudy brown beneath an off-white two finger head. Actual chocolate flakes do float about the bottom of the glass, the cherry ale lightens the color and eye appeal of this brew. Chocolate, cherry, almond and sugary notes create a parfum more admirable for complexity than actually enjoyable. The taste is perplexing. The chocolate and cherry flavors stand apart, rather than melding. Hops, malt, and an overbearing fruit sweetness collide to create a delicate, fussy, overthought delight, with a saccharin mouthfeel aftertaste, much like marzipan. I never understood the appeal of marzipan. Pretty much the same here. I get the mission, I sense quality ingredients. It just doesn't ring my bell.",3.94
Three Philosophers,"As I scroll down the reviews, I see a lot of variation. This one's a dark amber, lots of sediment, which ain't a bad thing. Prune, cherry, and tang (not the orange juice) are noticeable first, then a sticky thickness. THEN the alcohol (again, not a bad thing. Notes of bread on the back channel. I had a 4-pack a while back and forgot to review, enjoyed it then and now. A lot like an unsweetened thick cider that's fermenting to alcohol instead of vinegar.",4.23
Three Philosophers,"Appearance: Dark brown, tan colored mousse-like head, tight compact bubbles with excellent retention.

Aroma: Yeast forward, bubble gum is prominent. Caramel. Dark fruit.

Flavor & Aftertaste: Alcohol noted. Some chocolate notes mixed with caramel. Faint, mild cherry flavor. Dry start to finish.

Mouth-feel: Light to medium bodied, high carbonation.

Overall: Demonstrates quite a jarring bite between the higher ABV & high carbonation. Gets your attention. Label mentions cherries, but that's pretty well hidden in there. But, as you drink it, you start noticing the tart, sour finish. Highly effervescent. Visually, it promotes a lengthy, creamy looking head, more so than most beer styles. I'll admit, this beer is not my normal cup of tea. But, it's interesting and a nice change of pace. Not quite sure where it fits into my seasonal/regular beer routine. Well worth a shot.",4.32
Three Philosophers,"I cannot believe Ive never reviewed this beer! I used to drink the 750 corked and caged bottles of this beer on the regular!
Tonight I have a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter.
The beer pours a rich mahogany color with deep garnet undertones when held up to the light. A dense creamy beige head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a very sturdy surface layer that sticks around through the sampling.
Aroma on this one features some toffee and brown sugar and a bit of tart cherry note. Almost a little funky too, but no hop notes and the abv is well hidden at this point.
First sip reveals a medium body with fine tingly, yet soft carbonation. The beer feels a little slick, I expected and remembered more of a sticky feel, but its what Ive got right now.
Flavor is some brief brown sugar and a bit of dark fruit, raisins mostly. This rolls to some faint tart cherry notes and a little bit of a black peppery bite, which I attribute to the ABV. Even with this bite, the drying finish encourages me to take another sip, which gets me to emptying my glass much to quickly.
QUite a nice beer that Im glad to have revisited. Definitely a classic and one I will gladly drink again.",4.43
Three Philosophers,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Teku glass. Deep mahogany in color, fluffy white head, slowly receding. Watch that pour because this guy will get a little out of control. Scents of raisins, dates, prune juice and red wine. Flavors of baking spice, oak, brandy, dark cherries, prune, fig. It’s funny, I’ve been drinking 3 philosophers for years now but just realized I have never rated it. First time I’ve tried it from a can- no discernible difference from bottles but I also haven’t tried them head to head. I do appreciate the pint vs ~12 oz volume though- basically the same price between 4 cans and 4 bottles but going to have a nice buzz on by the time I’m done drinking a pint! Maybe the best Belgian style beer I’ve had from the US. I always like to pick up some of these when the weather starts getting cold and reminds me of decorating the Christmas tree.",4.38
Three Philosophers,"For my money this is as good as an American Belgian style beer can get. I tried this for the first time about 10 years ago, somehow never reviewed. I saw it in the local gas station in Delhi NY, about 30 minutes from the brewery. I knew nothing about it, but it was the only craft beer available, so I bought a six pack (well truthfully I also bought a sixer by Saranac, but that is an entirely different story). Needless to say I wasn’t expecting much. When I poured the first bottle into a goblet, it had a billowing three finger frothy head and gorgeous brown color with ruby highlights. Next I discovered a pleasant cherry and malt aroma. Then I had the first sip, and I couldn’t believe my taste buds. Cherries, plums, raisins, molasses, a subtle bread-like yeast, and a nice malt backbone. I took another sip, and it was just as good. Somehow the beer I bought between the Miller and Bud at my crappy local gas station was clearly a world class beer. I had previously lived in Colorado, and enjoyed New Belgium, but this was better! These days Ommegang is nationally known because of its Game of Thrones beer. But 3 Philosophers is truly the one and only king of American made Quads.",4.18

Well, let's see if it grows on ya. It is robust. And sour, but not too sour, but it has a bad flavor I can't name. I do not like it.

August 20, 2021 - Second bottle much better. Whatever that bad taste was it didn't recur. So its not bad. The 9.7 ABV is quite noticeable, not in the flavor, but in the effect. So I must have gotten a skunky one before. I raised the score for taste and overall.",3.9
Three Philosophers,"Poured from a pint can into a pint mug

L - Clear amber in color. Substantial light tan head three-fingers thick which settles to a complete and persistent layer. Lacing is present thanks to the thick ring of foam along edges of the glass though the head is so thick it takes a while to display. Looks like a glass of honey.

S - The cherry aroma is at the forefront. Very strong and sweet. Malt of brown sugar/molasses on the backend. No hops to be found. Smells just like a holiday fruitcake. Not detecting the typical notes found in lambics however.

T - A cornucopia of flavors intermingling. It's very hard to nail down individual ones. The typical fresh tartness and earthiness of the kriek yeast are dominant on the palate. It's sweet but not as sweet as the aroma would lead you to believe. Fruitcake in a glass would be a fair comparison. Cinnamon spices and brown sugar mix expertly with the cherries. There is a slight medicinal quality that a bit off-putting, possibly from the high gravity. Some may like that, but I don't. Thankfully it doesn't mar the experience too much.

F - This is a big boy. Each sip of this syrupy brew is like a bite of food. Very heavy body, carbonation level is medium but suitable for this. Probably best to drink this one on its own. You won't have much room for food otherwise.

Pours murky reddish brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

This has definitely lost its' intense hoppiness over time, but this honestly smells great now, like a lightly hoppy barleywine. I'm picking up on aromas of sweet brown sugar, molasses, toasted pecan, earthy hops, caramel, golden raisin, and light toast

Where it was charmingly old in aroma, this is a bit too old and faded in taste. It's not necessarily bad but it's showing significant age. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting earthy hops, fusel alcohol, caramel malt, and light fig. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, toasted pecan, brown bread, and nutty malt

A medium full body pairs with very mild carbonation, resulting in a smooth yet slightly hot beer. Finishes mostly dry with a mild earthy bitterness

T: this beer delivers as advertised; a heavy-hitting hop bomb cloaked in a ton of malt. The aging effect is evident as there is plenty of sugar on each sip. The prune-raisin combo is omnipresent and increasingly dominant with each sip.

F: this is a mildly viscous, smooth beer. Virtually no alcohol burn and minimal carbonation. Goes down relatively easy for a 10% ABV.

Double Bastard Ale,"I could tolerate the single (like a double), but this is so cloyingly boozy and abrasive even after eighteen months bottle aging, I don’t know if there’s anything good in there worth aging longer to find.",2.06
Double Bastard Ale,"A: The beer is coppery amber in color. Light tan carbonation that retains around the rim with no lacing.
S: Strong barley malt aroma is awesome. Sweet caramel and alcohol notes with a touch of hops.
T: tastes like a malt bomb explosion of high alcohol sweetness. Caramel and brown sugar up front. Then the self-proclaimed unreasonable amount of hops pokes through. Noticeable alcohol warming and vodka-like aftertaste. Moderate bitterness and hops balance out the sweetness making this a well-balanced, if unusual concoction.
M: Body is fairly light and syrupy, like a day old coke.
O: I think this beer is awesome. That being said, I like aggressive, in your face flavors. Your mom will hate this beer. But isn’t that a reason to try it?",4.23
Burton Baton,"Pours a copper color. Smells of a light vanilla, probably hops, and oak. The taste was that of a clean and crisp beer. Very tasty and delicious. The 10% ABV is hidden but effective. I like it and will definitely get more when I get the next chance.",4.29
Burton Baton,"It smells both like wood and the bright freshness of hops with just a little bread water in the background.

It tastes very interesting. The wood, sweetness and boozy flavor from the 10 abv remind me of whiskey... not bourbon because there's no smoke. After the whiskey you get bright hops and bitterness.

The mouthfeel is very light with just a little fizz. It finishes with an aftertaste of bitterness with breathy alcohol.

Overall it's very good. I wouldn't describe it as an IPA. It's a beer I can't really categorize. I give it a 4.9 out of 6. I think it would have received over a 5 if it hadn't come right after that insanely good stout.",3.94
Burton Baton,"Coming back to this after a long time... A real throwback to taste so much malt in a double-IPA, though I know this was a cross between a DIPA and an Old Ale. Back when DIPAs first arrived on the scene, many of them tasted this way-- like a hopped up Barleywine or Old Ale. If I close my eyes it feels like I'm back in 1999-- in a good way. Dogfish was way ahead of the curve in oak-aging a beer like this. Warming caramel and hop notes, with the alcohol well-hidden (as it should be). Hits the spot on a cold night when snow is in the forecast; masterfully done-- glad I revisited this classic.",4.57
Burton Baton,"Had this on draft.
A: pours orange amber body with off-white head with ok retention and lacing
S: sweet, orange grapefruit smelling beer with subtle earthiness
T: sweet, grapefruit taste with a subtle earthy aftertaste; some lemon notes as well
M: medium bodied and pretty smooth
D: nice mouthfeel and tasting combo; solid drinking beer overall; pretty good beer overall",3.7
Burton Baton,"Worth the price

Pours golden amber with thick suds.

Smells like like oak barrel. Clean and sweet.

Tastes like a creamy dream. Can't even taste the 10% abv and that's a fact. Most oak barrel aged stuff is a bit cloying but this has perfect balance. After taste of spicy vanilla that leaves you wanting just 1 more sip. Superb.

Extremely excellent brew! Lots of love goes into this force of nature.

Expensive but damn this is worth it. Dogfish Head is still a top tier company and this one proves it like a MF.",5.0
Burton Baton,"Bottled 4/1/17

Copper color. Left the sediment in the bottle. Khaki whit me head.

Everything I was hoping for. Malts and faded hops and oak all around. Caramel, toffee, bready malts, floral and citrus notes, vanilla, oak... this beer has it all. Love the grapefruit citrus. Not bitter or sticky, just smooth and easy drinking for 10%.",4.39
Burton Baton,"Bottled 3/1/19

Pours a mildly hazy copper/orange with 2+ fingers of fluffy off whit head, tons of lacing

A lot of subtlety in the nose, but right off the bat I pickup citrus, specifically orange zest, a light vanilla and caramel malt. Very complex in aroma, I'm guessing the flavor will be the same

Yep, I was right. Complex, but balanced between a biting hop and sweet malt. I pick up the oak notes clearly, it plays off the more bitter hops really well. The vanilla is in your face on the finish, with a mild citrus aftertaste

Gentle carbonation leads to a medium-full bodied brew. Finishes sweet and soft, wouldn't guess 10%

I've been on a good streak lately with a lot of beers that I'm loving and this one is no different! Not sure I could drink a lot of it, but I'll come back to this every now and then",4.14
Burton Baton,"This has been sitting in the fridge since I bought it in August as I waitd for some cold weather. Pours a brigt amber with heavy rotation orange tining. Head is thin but steady. Nose is wood and mint and vanila.

This is velvety in texture right off the bat, and while the flavors are rich and luxurious, they are also, for the style, subtle as hell. The primary flavors are caramel malt doused in oak and vanilla with peppermint, dark fruit, and black pepper in reserve. The texture is thick in the sip but there are very few other signs of high abv. This is an exquisite rarity. I am generally not a huge DFH fan and find them talented but inconsistent and overpriced. This is delicious and unique. Well done.",4.45
Double Trouble,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.4%, 86 IBUs. Surprisingly pale golden colour, probably the palest American double IPA I’ve seen. Big to moderate white head. Distinct but still relatively moderate aroma of citrussy and piney American hops, also notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour is of course very hoppy from start to finish, but not really extreme. The grapefruity bitterness is partly balanced by a pronounced malty sweetness. Notes of caramel and orange marmalade again. Very bitter aftertaste.",3.68
Double Trouble,"Hazed, amber/gold appearance with a medium size head and decent lacing. Subtle aroma; coaxed out some tropical fruit that resembled mango. Hoppy flavor leaned more resinous than citrus and was well balanced by the modestly sweet, malty backbone. Lush aftertaste.",4.12
Double Trouble,"12 oz bottle pours a glowing amber-copper color, nice thick head, leaves a nice sticky lacing in my glass. Strong grapefruit cotton candy aroma. Full bodied but carbonated , Strong citrus flavors, nice lasting bitterness, very tasty.",4.0
Double Trouble,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip.

Pours slightly hazy dark gold with excellent smooth foamy head that lingers well for the ABV and good lacing.

The aromas are more floral than pungent, with some good earthy aromas as well. Evocative of an old school over the pond IPA, rather than a piney American. But as the brew warms, pungent resins start to bloom.

The brew has a nice balance. A solid but delicate clean malt backbone offset with an ample earthy/floral hop flavor. Hints of honey, citrus, and graham in midstream. The brew finishes with growing resin and chive and some warming booze.

The mouthfeel is actually a shade beyond medium, and grows heavier as the brew warms, but the carbonation and leaning alcohol keep things in check.

Overall, a really good DIPA that combines a lot of different hop feels. Although it gets a little all over the place and unfocused as the brew warms.",3.94
Double Trouble,"Pours amber with a 1/2 inch tan head. Moderate lacing as you go. A bit hazy.

Aroma of orange, pine, grapefruit, floral.

Strong taste of pine, grapefruit, orange, a bit of pineapple. Resiny.

Medium to full bodied, heavy carbonation. Dry, bitter finish.

Outstanding. A damn good IPA.",4.25
Double Trouble,"One more drink before I hit the ""hard stuff"" for New Years...

...and what a good choice I have made. Great looking orange-yellow brew with frothy, thick head. Great lacing all the way down the pint glass. The smell was full of citrus and the mouthfeel was medium-bodied and full of decent carbonation. The taste is mostly what you will find when you take in an imperial IPA and overall, it's solid enough.",3.87
Double Trouble,"From notes 7/7/13: Pours an opaque deep gold producing 2 fingers of off-white, foamy, short-lived head that leaves motes and a small webby ring of lace. Aroma is grapefruit, orange and caramel malt backed by pine and melon. Taste is intense grapefruit with notes of orange, pine resin,tropical fruits, melon and caramel. Starts sweet with bitterness entering at mid-sip and becoming predominant in the finish and aggressively so in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low-medium carbonation, creamy, silky, a little oily in the finish and slightly chewy.",3.97

Double Trouble,"Lightly hazed gold with four fingers of bone color head. Very dense lacings.
Smell is malty with grapefruit hops.
Taste is malt forward with good grapefruit pine slightly dank hops.

Overall a tasty dipa. Bottled 06/19/19. The hops have most likely faded a bit.",4.18
Black Butte Porter,"Nice dark brown pour, big khaki head, to much for a glass of Coke, otherwise, nails it. Severely lacking in treats for the nose, some mild coffee aroma, taste buds say roasted malt, a bit of cocoa. It seems thin for the style, carbonation seemed ok.

This was purchased as part of a ""pick six"" and has some age, canned 1/26/22, if I see it fresh, I'll update.",3.34
Black Butte Porter,"Purchased at Fresh, in Tyler TX. Warmed in hands from fridge for ~30-60 sec. Poured into stein glass

Appearance:
Dark cola color with 2-3 inch, tan head

Nose:
Toasty aroma, with notes of cocoa, raisin, and spiced rum

Taste:
Initially, dark, burnt, and bitter. As the beer warmed, the bitter taste moved to the back end and notes of spiced rum and raisin, with a light sweetness. Milder bitterness on the back end.

Mouthfeel:
Initially thin, with fine effervescence. As the beer warmed, mouthfeel gained a small degree of body, but not significantly. About as expected for a 5.5% ABV beer.

Overall:
As someone who usually drinks brown, amber, or scotch ale, this was definitely outside my usual and, previously, I haven't had the best of experiences with stouts or porters. That being said, this was a darn good porter and one I would drink again!",4.2
Black Butte Porter,"A classic standby. Looks great, and tastes great. Loads of chocolate and coffee, some dark fruits and caramel. Licorice, and a hint of vanilla. The finish is charred toast and hop resin. The mouthfeel borders on thin, but it still has a nice creaminess, and the dry finish is very pleasant. It's well balanced, and very drinkable all year round.

The aroma is subdued, but it's hot in Texas, so I'm having it cold (usually drink these at room temp). I know from experience that the nose is much livelier at room temp (though still not as lively as the palate).",4.31

Black Butte Porter,"Brighton, Co:
LOOK: Pours an opaque darkest of brown to black color with an easy to pour 3b finger tan or light brown head that slowly fades but has overall good retention as well as lacing.
AROMA: Same roasted malts, bakers chocolate and cocoa.
TASTE: Again you get the roasted malts, bitter sweetness. Has a little smoky aftertaste.
Creamy and easy drinking.",4.27
Black Butte Porter,"For some reason I thought I had rated this one years ago. Apparently not.

Pours extremely dark brown, nearly black, with a nice fluffy cola head. Good lacing.

Aromas of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, licorice, and some yeast.

The flavors follow the nose and that's just fine. Dark and semi-sweet chocolate, dark coffee, vanilla, licorice, buttermilk and dark fruit (cherry) sourness, astringent roastiness at the finish.

Medium bodied. Incredibly drinkable for such a dark brew, owing to plenty of carbonation and a fairly drying finish.

Are there better American Porters? Sure. But at this price point and availability level? Nope. Wanna show someone the difference between a stout and a porter? This might be the perfect brew.",4.25
Black Butte Porter,2/11/22 Pitch black with a nice tan head. Roasted / burnt malt carries the day here. Some light coffee bitterness. Low ABV. Well balanced. Will add to the rotation.,4.02
Black Butte Porter,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into my spiegelau stout glass.

It looks like Guinness (co2) on the pour which I'd say is a good thing. Those big beers usually seem to be pretty good looking. 1.5 finger head that fades to a decent covering of head. Almost pitch black but at the bottom of the glass you can see it's a dark brow color where some light can get through.

Smell is full and quite strong with some rosty malts shining through, but there is quite a bit of fermentation character here, mostly just the smell of ale yeast bit it is quite strong. Not a lot more going on here but it's very malt forward and seems quite strong.

On my first sip it's quite dry and decently bitter. Once again some of those roasty malts are hanging in the back. Quite a lot of that ale character is up front. Slight tartness coming from fermentation as well it seems. Not a british flavor here, but despite the american yeast, hops arent all that present here. Maybe some for bittering cause it has a higher ibu than a porter or stout from the UK, but it seems to be a very malt forward american porter. Good but could be a bit more balanced. As I drink the bitterness becomes less pronounced and the malts shine more and more.

Feel is quite smooth and creamy, not a lot of carbonation bit but it's there. Easy to put down but still rich like chocolate. Could be dangerous if it was less pricey but I like it.

Overall a decent day porter. I wish there was a bit more sweetness from the malt but that's just taste. It does seem a bit dry for a porter but the roasty dark malts shine nicely here.",3.86

Taste: Charred malt, slight smoke, and a bitter bite with a finish to match. Also had a generic ""beer"" taste that was a little too prevalent for me.

Feel: Relatively smooth, medium carbonation.

S - Funny enough, bubblegum is present and fairly upfront. Turbinado sugar and molasses follow closely, with hints of dark wheat and cacao.
T - Bauernbrot and slight bubblegum fade into a deep baker's chocolate and creamy ristretto espresso. Bittersweet and well-balanced. The finish is a bright molasses and French-roast coffee with chicory.
F - Creamy and easy-to-drink. Filling. Full-bodied with very light carbonation.
O - A great campfire beer! A complex (but not too complex) entry-level porter that's easy on the wallet. This is now one of my favorite brews. I highly recommend this, and will purchase a six-pack if I can find it.",4.7
Black Butte Porter,"One of those days where one (very sub-par) beer wasn't enough. No real head formed as it went into the glass. The weak (or maybe my sense of smell is going today) scent was of root beer, Bazooka bubble gum (do they still make that anymore) with a touch of citrus. It was definitely dark, though more molasses than black and almost as opaque. A buttery feel in the mouth followed by some carbonation as it slid down my throat. In between, a slightly smoky, cherry coffee? I guess... that's my story and I'm sticking to it. The aftertaste is a bit like bitter coffee dregs with a little too much sweet'n'low. 0 for 2 tonight and I'm out of beer and it is past beer's bedtime in the stores.",2.57

Feel: Very smooth taste, very little carbonation.

Dragon's Milk,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH goblet glass

This beer is completely black with no visible highlights and about one fingers worth of dark tan head that quickly recedes leaving behind a fair amount of lacing.

Lots of roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon caramel, and coffee. The bourbon is fairly strong, but not overpowering, and adds just a bit of spice to the nose.

The dominant flavors are that of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, coffee, and to a lesser degree vanilla. Just the right amount of bourbon character, noticeable but not overpowering. Very well balanced. Full bodied and mildly carbonated.

I served this to myself in one of those weird sour glasses and it works. I get people roasting this for calling it basic but that's the thing it is basic but this actually decently crafted.

Dragon's Milk,"Appearance: Deep amber in color with a massive, coarse, and quite persistent tan head. Scattered, patchy lacing adorns the glass walls. Before a strong light at the thinnest part of the glass, some slight ruby highlights can be seen.

Aroma: Strong notes of bourbon, coffee, bitter cocoa, vinous alcohol, molasses and caramel dominate the aroma. There are also notes of wood; the alcohol is quite spicy.

Taste: The taste begins with notes of molasses, caramel, coffee, bitter cocoa, bourbon, dark fruit, spicy alcohol. As the taste progresses, the wood and bourbon notes firm a solid undercurrent to the taste, advancing as the taste progresses, as well as bitter cocoa. The alcohol produces a moderate and pleasant warming sensation. The taste concludes with a modest and lingering wave of bourbon and wood.

Mouth feel: Fairly full and soft, with only modest carbonation.

Drinkabilty/notes: Really quite nice, and a fitting toast to the New Year of 2022. Would pair admirably with rich chocolate desserts.

Taste: Well blended chocolate, coffee, bourbon, roasted malt. Nothing really stands out among the flavors. All are mild and well blended together.

Mouthfeel: Nice thickness, quite warming from the higher ABV, even though it's not harsh or that noticeable. Dry finish. Very light carbonation.

Overall / Drinkability: A very subtle/smooth barrel aged stout. There is some bourbon barrel character, but it's mixed in with all the other flavors. A good sipping beer - quite drinkable.

Bud Light,"16 oz draft pour at a Twins game. Looks like a light lager. Smells vaguely of hops and malt. The flavor isn't terrible, but it is very watery. It was free. I drank less than half of it. No interest in revisiting this half-beer in the future.",1.97

On the pour a decent 3 finger foamy white fine head formed that dissipates at a medium rate to a decent cap and ring. Carbonation is fine and the body is a golden light straw. Some lacing, decent.

Aroma has some Metallic smell alongside a very light lager yeast that isn't the most crisp, but I was expecting worse. Slight tartness, but a decent but super light crackery malt. Quite light but better than expected.

Taste follows the aroma with some vague off notes but nothing terrible. No hop bitterness and a light crackery barley. Quite watery tasting.

Feel is light and carbonated. Pretty nice, amd the finish isn't instant either. Super drinkable, and not as close to seltzer as michelob ultra.

Overall this is a decent light beer. Better than coors light, keystone, natty, and michelob ultra. About on par with miller lite however. It's a light beer its close to water but not the closest.",2.78
Bud Light,"how i have been waiting for this day. in ireland, bud light is a relatively new addition to the market, and where it is sold it’s usually sold in 4 packs. now im hardly buying 4 cans of most beer, let alone this, but sure enough today in my local shop there were loose cans, i didn’t really know what to expect from this to be honest, and to be honest it really isn’t as bad as i was expecting, there’s nothing particularly astringent about it, that being said it is some pretty cruddy lager, it’s just a vacuum of flavour, white bread malt and a faint sweetness, no bitterness, medium to high carbonation, reasonably drinkable but incredibly thin and watery, yeah it’s not good, but it’s not the worst either",2.2
Bud Light,"The first time I had a Bud Light, I wanted a Bud Light Lime. You can do worse in terms of beer, I know folks who treat this drink with anathema. The fact of the matter is that you can consume a Bud Light and drive sober by the time you've finished a savory Mexican dish.",2.85
Bud Light,"Pours light golden with sparkling water like tiny carbonization fizz in lieu of frothy head. No complex taste, aroma or flavor to note. Not complaining since we are chilling and vibing at the Simi Valley Happy face Music festival with this “free” bottomless light lager “beer” include with admission. Better than water? Cheers!",2.27

Bud Light,"No more should be needed than one brown twelve ounce bottle poured into a clear pint glass. There's no head, no glass lacing, almost no aroma and it's one of the most transparent amber colors you'll ever see. There are vague taste references to yeast, malt, hops and alcohol, without any discernable hierarchy. There is some decent carbonation and it's blandly drinkable. Still, it's not worth the time, calories or expense, unless it's free. In that case, reread the other two reasons not to drink it.",1.43
Bud Light,"I decided to pick up a can at the LCBO in Ontario 473ml at 4% in Canada brewed by Labbats brewery.
anyways this bud light poured into glass with 1 finger head clear golden color good carbonation.. smooth easy drinking beer and very refreshing.
Didn't leave much of a lace but it tasted good . Labbats brewery did ok
I can buy this again",2.86
Bud Light,"Very enjoyable.
Good for those days when I want to drink 3 or more beers without ""paying the price"" the next day.

Hoptimum,"Yields a clear amber color with a bigger, stable head.

The aromas lead with ripe passion fruit, caramel and dried lime zest among flowery blueberries and nutty honey.

Drinks soft, with a smooth mouthfeel and a well nuanced, late effervescence, which successfully manages to establish a slightly alcoholic refreshment.

Tastes of sweet caramel, creme brulee and white bread dough, together with bitter, pungent limes and a sweet, resinous malt backbone. Offers an equally sweet middle part with a medicinal hop bitterness, bringing out a buttery, toffee leaden sweetness. Finishes soft with a layer of whipped cream and additional caramel, only to invite a hop bitterness, which numbs the tongue like a local anesthesia, revealing a faint hint of alcohol.

Not a big fan as this seems not very balanced, as well as the beer‘s single components seem unable to create a flavorful synergy. Everything in this is overpronounced and standing in its own way, trying to steal the show while being too full to dance.",2.71
Hoptimum,"This beer is hands down one of the best Imperial IPAs in the world. Nothing but hops from the head down, smell and taste is of hop resin, pine and slight grapefruit. You can also smell and taste a slight booziness which is inevitable for this type of beer. The ultimate cure for a hop fix if you’ve ever needed one.",4.38
Hoptimum,"Pours a fairly clear golden color with about two inches of a light tan head. The smell is of some citrus, strong pine and hops. The taste is definitely on the pine and hops side and the alcohol is hidden well. Definitely worth it.",4.25
Hoptimum,"Enjoyed it when I was new to craft beer, appreciate it still as an experienced hop head. It has all the marks of quality, but is as inoffensive as a hoppy, high abv, in-your-face beer can be. Lots of malts and well rounded hops that aren’t overly bitter or resinous, but still taste citrusy and flavorful. Too booze and too sweet. But overall a well made brew.",4.23
Hoptimum,"The pour and appearance is beautiful. Reddish gold, nearly two inches of head, great retention, mostly clear. It doesn't taste high abv, but you do feel it on your tongue and as you drink it. Good amount of pine and definitely a western. Taste gets better as it warms a bit. Very smooth. Great IPA. A new favorite.",4.58
Hoptimum,"L: Reddish gold body
S: Creamy tropical fruit; mango, guava, pineapple, and pine resin.
T: Rich and creamy tropical fruit concentrated with pine resin. Floral notes on the finish, and a lingering piney bitterness that plays back and forth with a bit of tropical sweetness.
F: Incredibly smooth from start to finish. The alcohol is very noticeable in the mouth and chest.
O: Similar flavor profile to Heady Topper, but a bit sweeter; would be fun to do a side by side. Shockingly smooth for how high the ABV is. Glad I finally found one.",4.22
Hoptimum,"pours a hazy pale amber body with a cream colored foam head that billows with moderately high retention that leaves a high amount of patchy sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy cap with defined halo

aroma is sweet floral and earthy grapefruit and misc citrus with a malty dark caramel malt backbone

taste follows that up with a honeyed sweetness and a trace amount of pine that flashes towards the end; it's sweet but very hoppy, eventually balancing out. a certain fruitiness can be picked out eventually, but it is nondescript outside of being citrus adjacent.

mouthfeel is high carbonation and thick bodied - a constant battle between thickness and carbonation pillowing. it ultimately runs mid-way between smooth, thick, crisp before abruptly finishing dry and syrup-sweet with a grapefruit hop aftertaste with tinges of lowkey pine

overall:
pretty killer, but balance is missing. it's sweet, honey sweet with a thickness that is at battle with the carbonation to create a disheveled feel that is hard to settle into. it is certainly hoppy, but perhaps a little crowded - the features blend together and meld into more of a flashcard representation rather than a display of different players coming together to make something bigger by highlighting their complementary features.",4.16
Hoptimum,"Checking a long empty box, had Hoptimum--now even more illegal in Mississippi--poured from 12-oz. bottle, label stamped ""PKGD 03/24/21C,"" trade from friend, into Sierra Nevada tulip pint.

Pours light amber with clarity and 1/2- to 1-finger creamy, cream-colored head, with good retention, leaving nice lace down the glass. Sweet malt aroma off pour, then aromas of grass and pine, and some stone fruit showing as warms. Begins with carbonation and big hop bite, over smooth malt body, soon nearly overwhelmed by alcohol beginning to build, then some sharp and sweet stone fruits are also evident, before a big but not unbalanced bitter piney and alcohol heat finish.

Unsurprisingly, has none of the common defects in huge IPAs, and is an appropriate biggest brother to SNPA and Torpedo.",4.04
Hoptimum,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into pint glass in September 5, 2021. There is a ""Package"" date of 05/14/2021 on the bottle.

Appearance: Medium gold color with 2 finger white head. It is slightly hazy, but less hazy than New England IPAs. Head lasts a minute, and there is a little lacing.

Smell: Strong aroma from the hops as expected in an IPA: mostly pine and grapefruit, Also some sweetness like pineapple. Overall the pine and citrus aroma dominates the other aromas.

Taste: There is a strong hops flavor that is both refreshing and bitter. Very fruity and contains flavors of grapefruit, citrus, pine, and a little sweetness as well. Hoptimum has as a very nice after taste. Overall a nice balance and very drinkable.

Mouthfeel: Strong bodied. High alcohol, which matches the 11.0% listed. I nice thick feel when drinking.

This is a great IPA. It has a nice mix of citrus, hops, and other flavors, which makes it interesting. It has stronger flavors and body than most other IPAs. This has a good hop bite, but not over-powering. It is a very good IPA, and I would buy this again. One of my favorite IPAs.",4.46
Hoptimum,"L - Golden with a ton of clarity with a white head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - Tons of fresh, bright, bitter, piney hops along with some citrus and malt notes
T - Follows the nose with a punch of bright, piney, bitter hops up front and throughout tied together with a malt backbone and citrus notes - some honey notes, caramel, earth notes. Some floral notes as well.
F - Medium bodied with moderate amount of carbonation. Smooth, soft, yet crisp
O - A pretty solid TIPA",4.5
Hoptimum,"The pour is honey colored. The taste is bitter grapefruit upfront with some bready malts in the back. The 11% abv is well hidden but I am getting some heat from the alcohol in my throat in the aftertaste.

T: Very sweet caramel malt, sweet rich hop flower, honey, grapefruit, sharp apricot, raisins, pine and spruce. Light alcohol midway through and pine/spruce tip enters at the finish making it long but not overpowering.
F: Mouthfeel is sticky, heavy-bodied and intense. It is also lush, soft, and has a creeping long conifer finish that is in excellent balance and contrast with the overall sweet characteristics of the beer. It is somewhat dry at the finish.

Hoptimum,"Bottling date 4-7-21.
Bright, orange-amber color with a white head that slumped to what looked like a ring of lace fire lapping at the curved glass walls. Clear with a faint murk, no rising bubbles visible but they cascade when swirled.
The smells are classic old school left coast IPA. Big bouquet of flowers and spruce tips, sweet honey, blood orange and apricot jam along side toffee dipped in vodka notes.
First taste is sweet up front but flavoring/ mid boil hops move in quickly to balance the rich, caramel malt backbone. Great complexity and balance - lush and heavy on the tongue but the hop character stands up and keeps this from being cloying.
Not a beer for big gulps, this is a snifter sipper that will have you looking for another soon after draining the glass.
Full bodied and a bit harsh on the back end bitterness and sharp with alcohol but dangerously drinkable and seriously well balanced.",4.11

Anchor Steam Beer,Its a really carbonated and standard malty beer. I get a festive-Christmas like after taste from this beer which reminds me of nutmeg or cinnamon. I don't like that part. Earthy and nutty is how I would describe it. However more earthy. It's not a bad beer by any margin just not something that I enjoy. I leave beers for my own record so based for my tastes it's a 2.5 type of beer.,2.33
Anchor Steam Beer,"12oz bottle poured into narrow gauge pint glass.

Appearance: Copper colored body. Big & dense bone white head.

Smell: Malt forward aroma. Light caramel, toasty, slightly nutty. Earthy hops perhaps? They are light and its hard for the nose to pull out the aroma.

Taste: Toasty, grainy, and lightly nutty malt profile. A bready element in there as well. Complex and smooth malt sweetness. Light bitterness in the finish. Gentle earth and floral notes.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. moderate carbonation level. Creamy textured body.

Overall: My first time drinking a California common / steam beer. This beer was an obvious choice because it is readily available with a wide distro footprint and it's one of those old school beer's that has a certain nostalgia about it. This is a really excellant beer. I can see why it's iconic beer for sure. I would drink a bunch of these on a hot day at an outdoor potluck or BBQ.",4.25

L - Clear orange-amber, with a one-finger slightly cream head that goes away rather quickly. Not too much lacing.
S - Floral and earthy. Caramel. A bit of resin, too.
T - Wonderfully complex! Starts off nice and bready (think pumpernickel and brown bread), and leans into a hoppy wave of earth and floral notes. Ends on a bread crust note, and a lowly toffee air. A slight white grape note is present throughout. Well-balanced, for sure!
F - Medium-bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Refreshing. Super drinkable.
O - My first steam beer, and I've got to tell you - it's the perfect fishing beer. Well-balanced and complex, while not being super overwhelming. Refreshing and crazy easy-to-drink. Tons of flavor. Highly recommend!",4.33
Anchor Steam Beer,"Poured from a 12oz can.

The look is a nice solid amber, crystal clear with lively carbonation and a one finger head. Dissipates over a minute to a thin covering. No lacing

Aroma is giving me strong malty lager vibes here. Very lager aroma maybe some hops here, but they are definitely a small amount of bittering only hops. Maybe a bit of off aroma, slight skunk even with the can, but it could be an older can.

Taste leaves the off flavor right in the dust this is delicious. Right up front is amber lager similar to the aroma but it quickly goes into a weird ester-y altbier sort of thing and it's very interesting theres quite an evolution on this one despite seeming pretty basic when I got into it. Some hop bitterness on the very back end. Dont know what to really compare it to. But it's quite malty.

Feel is nice and creamy big body in the mouth bit still very easy to put down. Its al.ost like a milkshake in texture but liquid and carbonated if you can catch my drift l. Probably not but it's good. All year.

Overall a very interesting beer. I'm glad I got it. Not really comparable to any other style, but so easy to drink malty decadent lager ale wonderland, despite the cover (which your not supposed to judge by) only looking average at best.",4.04
Anchor Steam Beer,"I ordered a Fat Tire, but the bar was out and the bartender recommended Anchor Steam as a good alternative. I'm glad he did.

Look - dark amber, nice head that lasted.

Smell - malty with hints of sweetness

Taste - really good. The malt shines with just the right amount of hops in the background

Feel - Above average with moderate carbonation

Overall, I really enjoyed this and will order it again if I see it on a menu. I've never seen it in stores around me (southeast).",4.23
Anchor Steam Beer,"Two twelve ounce cans emptied into a clear glass liter mug reveal a pretty colored beer. It's brightly copper-amber and rather translucent. The slightly off-white head is much larger than what should have been expected for a reasonably gentle pour of a chilled brew. Obviously, it's well carbonated. It smells fuller than most American adjunct lagers. The malt is easy to find and is quite pleasant. There's a note of hops, too, but they're playing second fiddle. The taste is also much more malty than hoppy, although it's not hoppiless. Overall, it has an earthy and slightly nutty flavor, with a hop bittering at the finish. Although pleasant, that's the only complexity of the taste. Ìt drinks more like a Kolsch than a lager. The mouthfeel is disappointing. With all that foamy head, it drinks surprisingly flat. It's like most of the carbon dioxide went into the head, leaving little left for the beer. The history of this beer is renowned, even by casual drinkers. But, the craft beer phenomenon has made this more of a tradition than a treat.",3.99
Anchor Steam Beer,"Pours a slightly hazy orange amber from the can, light, creamy 1"" head with moderate retention but great lacing. Nose is sweet and bready with sticky malt, toffee, and light yeast notes; barley tea as it develops deeper on the palate.

Anchor Steam Beer,"Appearance: Clear, copper color. Frothy, off white head with good retention

Aroma: Mostly herbal with some caramel malt note

Flavor & Aftertaste: Spicy & herbal. Hints of mint. Moderate to mild bitterness.

Mouth feel; Full bodied. Medium length, clean finish.

Overall: The first craft beer I ever drank. Can't believe it took me this long to right a review & notes. It's full bodied. Presents herbal & spicy hops aroma and flavors on a mostly sweet malt backbone. There is hint of mint. Moderate bitterness. Nice, easy drinker. More flavorful than typical American golden pilsners/lagers. Nice looking beer in the glass. Always a joy to revisit.",3.96
Anchor Steam Beer,This is one of my all-time favorites. Not for any one thing but for the sum total that it is. It's not too heavy to drink a four or so and it's heavy enough to know you are not drinking watered down corn fermented corn juice which I detest. The hop amount is nigh on perfect for the masses yet enough for the aficionado who discerns the kind and type. They never need to change this one as it is the perfect high-quality everyman's brew. I say that but it does command a more premium price than a everyman's brew and in most areas is only available in sixers (i.e. no 12-packs and no cases which is a huge mistake). I have only one more thing to say and that is I would drink this happily if there were no other brews and that is in spite of the new yellow and blue labeling which sucks as the previous label was the absolute best in the who brewing business.,3.68
Anchor Steam Beer,"L: Pours amber. Mild carbonation and nucleation. Remarkably clear.

S: Roasty toasty barley. Bready sweetness, and a touch of hops.

T: Tangy and zangy, caramelized grain.

F: Thick and bready flavor but it's rather lightweight.

O: I would relate this to Shiner Bock or Okocim. It's rather nice. I'm going to read about it and see what they have to say, now.",4.0
Anchor Steam Beer,"Generally an underrated beer. Pours a crystal clear copper color with an off white head, the slight head from 12 oz bottle dissipating in a few minutes. A clean malty nose with a mild more English ale hop note. This beer has a wonderful malt and hop balance, Lightly carbonated, an enjoyable clean malty taste with a crisp bitterness, think northern brewer / Kent goldings, unique in style, with a total absence of the typical Cascade piney notes. Totally unique and the canonical steam beer, the mix of pale and caramel malts provide a very slight sweetness that is perfectly balanced with the level of bitterness. Very drinkable, a really lovely beer.",4.38
Sculpin - Grapefruit,"12oz can purchased off the shelf as part of a mix-a-six pack for $2. PKG 07APR22, so this is almost four months old.

Look: Pours a very pretty copper color. Almost completely clear; just a very faint haze that appeared after I poured the bottom of the can. There was a thick, rocky off-white head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: I definitely smell the grapefruit aroma up front. It smells nice. Other fruity, caramelly, and herbal/vegetal notes but nothing distinctive besides grapefruit. After delving into it, I can detect nice apricot and orange zest aromas.

Taste: It's very tasty. Up front, there's grapefruit flavor with a bit of acidity. The mild, gentle initial grapefruit flavor explodes into an oily, bitter, pithy profile that attacks the sides of the tongue and the back of the palate. The finish is long, piney, resinous, and bitter with lots of grapefruit peel and pith. Eventually, I can detect a pleasant caramel malt sweetness after the bitterness subsides. Even though this beer is so bitter, I feel like there is an element of balance to it because along there's also a lot of caramel malt to help counteract the strong bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied with an appropriate level of carbonation. Someone oil, slightly chewy mouthfeel.

Overall: This has got to be one of the quintessential West Coast IPAs. I tried regular Sculpin IPA many years ago, and I was utterly unprepared for how bitter it was. This is also very bitter, and I think that my palate has adjusted over the years and now embraces bitterness. This beer requires a palate adjustment for many folks, and that's okay because many folks' palates (and minds) need to be adjusted! It's also nice to see that this beer can hold up to Father Time; at almost four months old, it's still very aromatic and flavorful.

Sculpin - Grapefruit,"Canned 3/10/21

As mentioned in my Sculpin review (last night), this was also one of the first beers that got me into the craft scene. Thusly, I never got around to actually reviewing it. At the time I just knew that I liked it, but couldn't articulate what about it I liked. Finally, 3 years later it's getting an actual review. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy amber gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Obviously some hops can give off a pithy grapefruit character, but it's easy to tell that it's just straight up grapefruit used in this one. I'm picking up on aromas of fresh ruby grapefruit, bready malt, white pepper, earthy hops, and light pineapple

In the OG, the aroma is far superior to the taste. Here, they meet in the middle and equalize, matching each others intensity. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting orange rind, sweeter grapefruit juice, grassy hops, bready malt, and light lemon. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, pithy grapefruit, orange rind, bready malt and light pine

A light medium body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a slick yet biting beer. Finishes mostly dry without much sweetness

It's good, great even. But it doesn't match the smoothness of the original. Definitely a worthy variant and it stands on its own as a good beer",4.21
Sculpin - Grapefruit,"It's been some years since I had this as one of my neighbors gave me a can he purchased in Cincinnati. For a few years after Sculpin was widely available locally, but now I rarely see it. In any case, it had the great hop bitterness of regular Sculpin -- with grapefruit on top. I liked it, but have not sought it out.",4.31
Sculpin - Grapefruit,"Obviously very citrussy scent with the sweetness of a little malt.

The taste is almost exclusively bitter which is good and then the grapefruit and some bready malts.

It's thin with moderate carbonation.  The finish is actually both bready and a little citrus.

Overall it's a very solid IPA.  I give it a 4.9 out of 6.",4.1

Upping the taste a little bit as since this is a variation the grapefruit should be the featured flavor and I did get it",3.79
Sculpin - Grapefruit,"First off this is definitely my favorite grapefruit beer of all time..Its been awhile since I've seen it on the shelves but it just showed up at my local hipster, labodega, gourmet beer store so I was enticed to pick up a can. ..

The date shows that it's only a month and a half old which is game on for an ipa, and I've had it in the past so it was like running into an old friend that your actually happy to see..

I poured this beauty into my speigelau IPA glass and got a perfect 2 finger head with a slight carmelized note and a pure strong grapefruit scent like no-other beer I've ever experienced...

Taste: Again, up front is initially strong notes of grapefruit and floral fading to the more hoppy IPA, not too bitter though

Feel: Easy to drink, not too heavy nor too rich, good amount of carbonation

An odd brew. Not an IPA. Not a typical wheat beer.

Glad I tried it but not really my style",3.51
Gumballhead,"Look: It pours golden with brilliant clarity. It has a white head with very good head retention.

Smell: It has grapefruit and citrus flavors. There is a low grassy element to it with slight yeast and some earthly notes.

Taste: It has strong citrus flavors with grapefruit. There are doughy flavors after the initial flavor which is strong in the finish. There are some earthen flavors and lemon as well.

Feel: It has a medium body with a hoppy bitter, but not harsh finish.

Overall, it's has plenty of flavor with citrus, grapefruit and lemon being the strongest up front and dough and earth finishing it off.",3.98
Delirium Tremens,"Poured Into a chilled mug......
Color of white Blonde like Blondie.....bleach blondes are hot...!!
Woooaaa, slow the pour down!!! This brew has a foamy head that simply did not dissapate!...The foamiest frigginn' head I have ever seen in a beer peroid?!?!......
Spicy hops smell, traditional with Belguin beers...
Of the bat Spicy mild hops deep and rich....Floral right away...then notes of crackers, lemon peel and honey!! Dis beer is da bomb!!! @ 9 Percent ABV you can hardly tell...sign of a great beer.
Good carbonated, bubbly....

Apricot, floral, and marmalade in an appealing perfume. Yeasty, spicy notes as the beer warms, some orange/citrus and a grassy hop late in the flavor. Light body, high carbonation.

Indian Brown Ale,"Appearance: Very very dark brown, but ruby red up to the light. Off-white to cola head with a bit of spotted lacing and average retention.

Nose: Nutty, coffee and toffee. Lightly roasted coffee beans, brown sugar and some chocolate at the end.

Taste: Creamy but a little bit dry upfront. Not as malty as I assumed it would be. It is slightly dry and a bit like sucking on a lightly toasted coffee bean. Astringent throughout. I get an unpleasant bitterness from the hops. So much so that I switched glasses halfway through to make sure it wasn't my glass. My eyes and my nose wanted this to taste a certain way, but my mouth said otherwise. Mouthfeel is nice, but a tad watery.

Notes: I was excited for this one as Dogfish usually hits it out of the park (in my opinion). I think the hops being added to what should be a bit maltier brew throws this one off. It's a great idea, but doesn't know what it wants to be.",3.38

Head is a dark red color. Smell some chocolate and caramel and a little fruit as well. Taste definitely was good. Right off the bat you taste some cocoa, a little nutty, and some coffee hints. What shines through is you taste some hops, not West Coast IPA strength or even NE IPA strenght , but just enough to give this a little bite, more so than your typical brown ale. Mouthfeel is light, definitely tastes lighter than it's 7.2 ABV. It's definitely a solid beer, a little slightly overrated in my opinion but definitely solid. If you like Brown Ale's and IPA's it's a must try.",4.03
Dreadnaught,"Found this classic at Gary's in Madison not too long ago, as I never had this before. Love 3 Floyds and was glad to see them return to this neck of the woods recently as they were one of the breweries that got me into craft beer, well over 15 years ago. Indeed, this was worth the hype as it's still one of the better Imperial IPA's after all of these years!

Such a beautiful copper hue to this as it was topped off with a ton of head that made this look like a loaf of bread, but with hops. Gorgeous, layered lacing stayed behind as I worked my way through this as I don't think I've ever seen so many rings on my glass at one time. Caramel, earthy hops, pine, dark bread, stone fruit, and a bit of tea spice were in the nose as the taste was just as deep, varied, and enjoyable. This wasn't weak but didn't quite feel as strong as it's listed ABV%, which made this that much more impressive. Toasted malt, weed, and a hint of chocolate stuck around in the back as this was a wonderfully layered beer that opened up nicely once it fully warmed.

This was strong but in the sense that there was so much flavor here as the alcohol was on par with everything else going on. Packaged on 3/21, this held up amazingly well and would be something that I'd easily reach for again. Really impressed with this as I'm glad that this is available here as I can't recommend this enough. It's easily worth it's lofty rating on here as this was an old-school brew that's easily withstood the test of time!",4.44
Dreadnaught,"16oz can from Beers of the World. Golden pour with a white fluffy head. Fruity, malty aroma, caramel, pine. Taste is some piney, mildly astringent hops coupled with sweet toffee notes. Bitterness and warmth rise up at the finish.",4.43
Dreadnaught,"ABV: 9.4%
IBU: 86
BOF #42 (currently)

Clear deep amber. Moderately carbonated. Very tall off-white head. The head is thick and creamy appearing with excellent retention. The surface becomes rocky and pitted as it does slowly recede.

The aroma is old-school IPA. Citrus – grapefruit, hints of pine and resin. Melon. Crackers and bread.

The initial taste favors the crackers and melon for the first few milliseconds, but with the grapefruit and pine coming quickly and dominating. Yet, these flavors back off a bit near the finish with a woody tannin and hops bitterness sharpening the end. The aftertaste lingering is bitter grapefruit, tannin and pine, and bitter. And, yet, the finish and aftertaste is on the sweet side. The alcohol is nowhere to be found except in the eventual buzz. The bitterness in the aftertaste intensifies as I progress through the beer, but if anything, that just makes this beer even better. Very well balanced.

The mouth feel is substantial – creamy, thick even for an IPA.

Overall, this is in line with my expectations. That may sound less than high praise, except that my expectations were quite high to begin with given the brewer and the BOF rank of this beer. An excellent DIPA. One to enjoy. Those of the juicy hazy milkshake “IPA” crowd, well, you should just move along.",4.38
Dreadnaught,"From the bottom of the can: ""PKGD ON 03/21/22""
There is some text below that but it has a big ink blot on it and can't be read.

Appearance: The body is a nice medium gold and light sun tea color. It has good clarity with a light opalescence. There is a medium-sized frothy white head with both very good head retention and good lacing.

Aroma: It has a pleasant wildflower aroma which is obvious and present but not strong. There are hints of hay-grass and pollen. A light mint aroma as well. It smells good.

Taste: Up front there is a light bit of peach with a touch of spearmint. Towards the middle of the mouth there is this light bit of caramel and some pleasant mint flavor. There are earthy notes of oak and twig with hints of tea leaf. Towards the back of the palate there is more of an earthy mint character. It finishes with a bit of cocoa chocolate flavor and toasted oak. It has a lot of complex and interesting flavors.

Mouthfeel: The body feels clean and on the lower side of medium bodied. It sticks to the tongue when it needs to but leaves it when appropriate. It has a medium hop bitterness and what feels like a bit of grain bitterness. Great carbonation.

Overall: It's a solid beer. It has a bit more of an earthy focus with mint notes and hints of oak, giving the beer a lot of depth and complexity. It isn't really an East Coast or West Coast style Imperial IPA which is kind-of fitting for a brewery located in Indiana. 3 Floyds really seems to hit their stride in this beer. By the time the glass is gone you want another one. I highly recommend it, and it's worth picking up at least a 4-pack. I would definitely drink it again. The highlight in this beer is the woody, oaky character that it has.",3.91
Dreadnaught,"6 oz mini-snifter pour at Lures Bar & Grille. Excited to finally try one of the OG pine/caramel WCIPAs. Pours a reddish caramel color with a smallish off-white head. Aroma and flavor feature caramel, pine, citrus rind, and booze. Mouthfeel is somewhat harsh and boozy. Overall: I've had some great old-school WCIPAs recently (Double Dale's is excellent) but this isn't one of the better ones.",3.89
Dreadnaught,"If I read the label of this great brew I might not have expected the genuine bitterness with not a hint of the usual juicy finish. I'm not disappointed, I just wasn't ready for what was to come. At $5.16 it is a poor value. My sample is exactly one month old.

It pours golden, translucent and fizzy. The aroma is pretty intense if you really go in for it - nice and citrusy. The taste is all dark malty and bitter hops with a thick and very bitter finish.

Recommended. I like a lot of 3 Floyds stuff, and this one is like the extra large version, with an extra bitter profile. Overpriced.",4.18
Dreadnaught,"Haven't had this beer in a long time. I found a 4-pack of tall boys dated two weeks out. Very fresh! How could I resist. This is your classic old school DIPA. Pours a mostly clear amber color, with a giant frothy head that sticks around forever. Aroma has some nice citrus notes with a touch of pine. Flavor is classic, while the hops steal the show, mostly an orangey citrus but some nice pine sap too, there is a nice malt presence, reminiscent if lightly toasted biscuits. Finishes fairly bitter, while the impression is borderline sweet, overall the palate remains dry with a lingering bitterness. Damn, I miss DIPAs (and IPAs in gereal) like this. So tasty! Yes, you can still find old school DIPAs, but they seem to get lost in the sea of hazies.",4.4
Dreadnaught,"Old school DIPA from Three Floyd’s. I’ve been so happy since we’ve started getting tons of their beers, including the barrel aged bottles. I love getting to drink these reasonably priced old school IPAs. This one pours a clear dark gold, with aroma of citrus, tastes slightly bitter, a bit of malt sweetness making the taste almost of lemons and oranges mixed together. Great west coast DIPA.",4.38
Dreadnaught,"So I'm updating from my 2013 rating. I gave it a 4.5 then. This probably isn't a good comparison.
I stopped by Glendale Liquors on Rt. 27 in South Brunswick and saw Dreadnaught, and didn't even give any thought to the $18/4pack price. Until sitting here looking at reviews and warming up on a Nugget Nectar, I never even thought to check the date. But I saw a review that says 3F have discontinued this beer. So I looked. I can barely make it out, but there it is, ""Pkgd on 2/14/21.""
Apparently, Glendale charged me $18/4 for a year old beer. Shame on me for trusting them. But lets see how it is aged. At 9.4% ABV, its got to retain something, though I don't expect it to be hops.
So it looks like a fine NE IPA...dirty blonde color with a good head, so hazy, its opaque...I'm trying to remember if its unfiltered? Do they do that in Indiana?
Age has definitely impacted the nose. I'm getting a moderately sweet, breadyness with no trace of pine or citrus.
Age hasn't been kind to the flavor, either. mostly that barleywineish sweetness with bitterness around the edges. Mouthfeel is still very chewy and quite lovely. But I won't add ratings to waterdown what I gave before.
But after a year, i'd give it 4.25, 3, 2.5, 4.25, 3.25.
And a warning to doublecheck the dates when you think you found something good at Glendale Liquors on Rt 27!!!!",4.5
Dreadnaught,"I am usually more an APA drinker with the occasional gem of an IPA. My last was Pliny the Elder. I was not expecting to reminisce of it from 3 Floyds, and from a $4.99 4-pack, no less.

A refreshing looking amber hue with candied pine on the nose. A burst of citrus ages to tropical fruit over a few seconds, then a pop of pepper and a grapefruit finish. It finishes with strong herbal notes that never overpower. A light, creamy orange washes over the palate soon after.

Just an absolute pleasure. I've been a big fan of 3 Floyd's Zombie Dust, but found their other variations much more of the same. Dreadnaught was expected to disappoint. I wondered why it was the last pack on the rack. I wonder no longer. World-Class, indeed.",4.47
Dreadnaught,"Pours a translucent golden color with a large fluffy head that ends up as lots of lacing.

Initially smells of slightly dank piney hops. A warmer glass adds grapefruit and pine apple.

Tastes of piney hops with sweet malt upfront with citrus and pineapple coming out as my glass got warmer. It has a slightly bitter and boozy finish.

This is a not overly assertive west coast IPA with some sweeter nuances and a punch.

Medium body with light carbonation. Light dry mouthfeel.",4.4
Dreadnaught,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 2/15/21, so 4 months old.

Looks outstanding in the glass. Clear pale amber body with a massive cream colored head. This slowly dissipates to a collar and solid covering, leaving layers of lacing.

Not much of an aroma here, not that I have much of a nose. A little musty fruit.

On tasting, a strong sweet malty wave washes through the mouth. Just when you start to think ""malt bomb?"", the palate is attacked by a pine/resin/grapefruit assault. Like 2 beers in one. Me liking this.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish pine citrus bitterness.

Overall, just an outstanding old school dipa. Would love to compare this 4 month old can with one fresh off the line. Holds up extremely well.",4.25
Dreadnaught,"Review 1549
Continuing with Three Floyds Beer, Dreadnaught is next. The last Pale ale was tasty, looking forward to this one. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered off-white head. The head is airy, foamy, and creamy with excellent retention. The dissipation left chunky lacing on the glass. The color is SRM 8, amber yellow with orange hues. The clarity of the beer is mostly clear with a few yeast floaties. A stellar presentation for the beer.

I first detect pine, grapefruit, floral esters, and resin. Next, I smell biscuits, lemons, a touch of passion fruit, wet grass, phenols, caramel, and a hint of dankness.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, resin, pine needles, lemons, pineapple, fruity esters, phenols, oranges, caramel, a wee bit of toffee, malty sweetness, grapefruit, herbal, and a hint of pharmaceutical.
The mouthfeel of the beer is warming, astringent, and tannic.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.

This is a perfect example of Imperial IPA. The hop profile is extraordinary. The malt backbone is firm but not overbearing. It reminds me of Ruination, but better. I am enjoying this beer.",4.75
Dreadnaught,"This, I think, is my first rating in NINE years. (I've done a lot in the intervening time on Untappd, but BA will always have a soft spot for me.)

So, as I understand it, FFF is no long producing this beer. I bought it recently for a mere $9 from a local shop. It was bottled April 2018.

I first had this beer a good 20-odd years back. This sample reminded me how incredible FFF is. Although this has citrus and mango fruits in the mix, at 3+ years, those fruits have ceded to the malts, pine and...a nice, dry finish.

I need to get back to that local beer shop and my the remaining stock of these big berthas. I think they had 5 or 6 remaining and in a fridge.

Gonna miss it when it's gone, but enjoying it now immediately transports me back 20 years. Ahhhh...",4.53

Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"This review will only be limited to the category of American Adjunct Lager. With that said we can skip the looks smell and feel because it doesnt matter when it comes to this. Pabst is probably my favorite of all the commercial beers with Miller Highlife right behind it. Never have understood why so many people insist on drinking Bud Light and it's the worst we'll,. I take that back. Natural Light is the worst beer in history but it is the same company. Anybody remember when Bud Dry was introduced? I have a suspicion that they accidently fermented all the sugars out of a batch making it dry as in 0 on a hydrometer. They tried to sell what they could but nobody liked it. The commercial said ""Why Ask Why?"". ""Drink Bud Dry"".

Better than Coors by a mile. Better than MGD by a mile. Not heavy carbonated or heavy ABV so it goes well with the summer heat.

Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass

On the pour a 2 finger head forms which reduces relatively slowly for the style to ring around the rim and a covering of fine bubbles over the whole beer. Body is light gold a bit darker than bmc beers, but very similar. Relatively lazy carbonation for the style, and crystal clear.

Aroma is very light, but it seems like a good thing as there isn't a lot of malt or anything else going on. Some adjunct sweetness and generic lager aroma but nothing fantastic or notable. Possibly vaguely corny and chemically as well, but not disgusting.

Flavor follows the aroma with adjunct sweetness followed by some vague malts and corniness. The flavor then goes into its yeasty flavors which is dominated by a dry generic lager flavor with a bit of diacetyl thrown in for fun it seems. Not much is really off, but there is so little malt flavor that's all that really comes through.

Feel is not the best for the style either, head doesn't really return to give a creamy feel but rather has mostly carbonation bite leaving the beer feeling rather dense. Still light compared to other styles but the feel was all that was really left for this beer to redeem itself.

Overall it's boring with just enough off and no real redeeming qualities to make it one that I'm not going to come back to. No malt flavors and the adjunct ""maltbill"" is so obvious that it's not even funny. Feels like corn soda almost.",2.7

But just know that this beer is good, got me drunk after 3 (16 oz) Don't let the stats fool yeah, it might be low ABV but was brewed with such care that it packs an unbeknownst punch. Don't just take my word, drink it yourself and tell us how it makes you feel.",3.6

Pabst Blue Ribbon (PBR),"The problem with PBR is it tastes passable if weak. So it's easy to drink, but by the time you've gone through one or two tall boys your short-term responsible drinking allotment is done and all you've drank is more or less nothing in the flavor category.
A flat out bad beer you can't drink and just give up on. With PBR you keep trying and by the time you figure out it's a road to nowhere it's too late. Which makes it the beer I hate most in the world. My advice is to limit to 1 12 oz serving or dump those 4 last ounces from the tall boy on principle. Probably was better before megacorp X bought it.",2.4

Hennepin,"Review 1529

My continuing quest for the best has to lead me to this beer. I had to get this beer shipped to me, living in a beer desert it hard to get good beer. The beer is 46 degrees and served in a tulip glass. A beautiful two-fingered bright white foamy and creamy head was formed. The retention of the head is excellent. Lacing was created on the glass as it dissipated slowly. The color of the beer is SRM 6, pale amber with golden yellow hues. The beer is clear with loads of carbonation bubbles.

I first get spicy hops, a touch of floral, malty sweetness, wet grass, and orange peel. Nosing further, I detect coriander, wheat, and phenolic.

The flavors in the beer are orange peels, floral esters, ginger, coriander, phenolic, lightly toasted malts, and malty sweetness akin to honey. The flavors kind of remind me of Belgium pale ale with a splash of Heff. It does have a light funk factor nothing I really could detect.

The mouthfeel is crisp, effervescent, and creamy.

The body of the beer is medium, high carbonation, and a medium finish.

This beer is stellar. The flavor complements each other well and the malt profile is there but not overbearing. The hops are subtle but firm giving away to the spice addition in the beer. If I could get this beer, it would be a staple in my beer fridge.",4.52

Hennepin,"Appearance: Upon opening the glass, it is billowing out of the bottle. Pours a semi-cloudy (~40%), medium golden/orange color that has sediment floating around in it. A strong white head. SRM of 9-10. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread and cracker malts upfront. This follows into a banana and clove ester quality. A bit of banana bread and Belgian spice. Some juicyfruit, but ultimately it smells malty. (3.75)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more bready malts upfront. Cracker, bread, and then follows into a Belgian spices of clove and banana. This linger and provides a tart and spicy pepper astringency before it finishes with a sweet, almost candied malt finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. Finishes soft on the palate.

Compared to Boulevard's Tank 7 Farmhouse Ale 4/16/21: Pours a more orange color with a milder head. More bready, clove, and banana malts. Less fruit, citrus, coriander, and yeast. Winner: Tank 7

Overall: A pretty good farmhouse ale/sasion. I wanted to see how this one compared to one of my favorite saisons, which is Tank 7. I think I prefer the Tank 7. This is a decent beer, but as other have mentioned its leans more malty, bready, and sweet. The clove, banana, and pepper spice show here.

Ah.... one of my first beer-loves, back in ancient times, c. December '97. Somehow I haven't reviewed it , & have to admit, slightly intimidated to do it now. How to do it justice? Will the ""objective #s measure up to my overall impression of it? Hmmmm??? OK, here goes :

Translucent gold-ish orange, with a huge forever head , that leaves a thick ring , substantial surface covering, and sheets of lacing . (Or it would, if I could hold off on drinking for a few more minutes - trust me - that's what happens. ;) )

Smell ? Nectar-Of -The-Gods, if you like that sort of thing. ;) . The usual banana, clove, ""spicy"" [ coriander+black pepper+ je ne sais quoi yeast aroma ], with a touch of ""fresh"" [wheat-derived, mostly] aroma, that usually accompanies saisons, goses, & Berliners. Just better than the usual.

Taste is similar to aroma, sort of, with elements of [very] ripe banana, black pepper, clove, coriander, 2-day-old homemade bread crust, a vague, very faint citrus element, a kiss of sweetness, and that ~indescribable (by me) , signature Ommegang yeast flavor . Some mild, mildy-drying bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, but give the impression of substantial presence, while also floating-on-air, just above eye level. Moderate, moderately-soft , carbonation tingle that extennnnnnnnnndddddddssss for quite awhile , before disappearing, & leaving the front pof the tongue a bit dry, & slightly stripped.

Overall, as you might guess, I am astounded & enthralled all over again. If anything, this might be a bit TOOOOO fresh , & could use 3-4 more months on it. If memory serves, I'd give the ""Taste"" rating another +.25, in that ideal state. ('Course, that might just have been the abv X [#beers] being the voices in my head. ;) In any event, if you haven't tried this, please, do yourself a favor, & go for it. (& for Dog's sake, don't drink it ice-cold - let it warm up to 45-50F , or so. :) )",4.48
Hennepin,"Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a thick white head. Funky aromas. Sharp carbonation and medium to heavy bodied. There’s a good saison flavor under there, but it’s masked a bit by the coriander and ginger. Maybe it’s just a personal flavor preference, but these flavors just don’t quite seem to go with the style.",3.68
Hennepin,"Poured from a 12oz bottle into a stem glass.
Strong 2-finger head when poured. Some decent lacing on the glass and nice lingering thin head on beer while drinking it down.
Strong copper color filled with carbonation bubbling to the top to keep that thin head going.
Coriander and spice right away invite you to take a drink.
Sparkling mouthfeel as soon as you take a drink and that smooths out at the end.
As described on Omegang's website, you can taste the coriander, spice, and orange peel for a really delightful beer drinking experience.
Overall, this is everything you want in a 'traditional' Saison- I fell in love with everything Omegang brewed years ago when Belgian beers became popular. It's so nice to revisit an old friend and put up a review on ba. I strongly recommend this beer any time of the year. I can't wait to try Omegang's newer offerings!",4.5

Great beer!",4.64
Hennepin,"Nice golden color, thick head, nice lacing. Smells sour, fermented wheat. Smell throws you off, it tastes nothing like it smells. Very smooth. Notes of orange, barley, spices, ginger. Nothing too pronounced, very well balanced. Mouthfeel is quite fizzy with medium-light viscosity. Overall, it doesn't smell good but it excels in most other categories. Excellent brew",4.06
Hennepin,"This beer has a beautiful, rich taste on poor. It has a succulent, foamy head with a light amber color. The aroma is not all that apparent. However, the taste is really good. It's crisp and refreshing, especially during a pandemic on a hot, humid day in DUMBO, Brooklyn. I don't smell or taste much in the way of orange peel or the coriander. However, the coriander taste is subtle but clearly there. This beer is refreshing. Even with a 6.5% ABV it's not heavy. A must true.",4.46

Blind Pig,"510 ml (1 pint, 1.25 ounce) bottle, bottled on 06/10/22. Served in a Spiegelau IPA glass, the beer pours a mostly clear golden/orange color with about an inch and a half off-white head that stuck around for a very long time. Lots of lacing, too. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like grapefruit, orange, pine, bready malt and some floralness. I think the taste is pretty similar to the aroma, but with a little more kick and the addition of some citrus peel, grassy and earthy flavors. Nice bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's slick and smooth with a moderate amount of carbonation. Pretty easy to drink. I wish more IPA's were like Blind Pig, I'd buy this quite a bit if I could get it around here. Thanks to one of my Instagram buddies for sending me this, it was a great surprise!",4.46

Not as nice, but still very good. Different.
Golden to orange look. Nice white foamy head with good lacing.
Aroma is citrus and pine-maybe woody like the label says.
I taste the pine, the citrus and the hops. None of those tastes overpowering though. Very astringent mouthfeel but with a decent amount of carbonation.

Blind Pig,"Brief Review:

O: First time trying Blind Pig, this beer has been around a while. Despite the West Coast IPA being out of style, this one isn’t too bad. Very light and drinkable, dry finish. Almost sessionable in a way. I’ve definitely had similar beers along the way, but it’s nice to have an OG this tasty.

Recommendation: Easy to get if you’re ever on the West Coast, it’s definitely a must-try if you’re out there.",4.56
Blind Pig,Beautiful to look at and smell but the flavors in the nose aren't in the taste. Hoppiness too overpowering to enjoy. There are more sophisticated IPAs to be had.,3.28
Blind Pig,"Canned Feb 21 2022, enjoyed Mar 20, 2022. So about a month old. Received from @JayORear in an LIF from NBW BIF #14.
Poured honey color amber and quite transparent, capped with a short near white head and active carbonation continues throughout.
The aroma was mild for me; but my nose id damaged from chemical foolishness (Really, when a liquid recommends that you use a respirator when using it, USE a frickin' respirator!)
The taste was a surprise. Russian River IPA, WC all the way, right? It's like they took a page from Bell's Two Hearted and balanced the malts in with the hops. That piney dominance I expected wasn't there, but it existed in harmony with other flavors; floral, doughy, herbal, etc. Not what i expected but still really tasty.
The feel? With the active carbonation, this checked all the boxes in the regards to feel.
OA, one I've been wanting to try a long time and finally got the chance. It's not what I expected but it's really good in an unexpected way.",4.53
Blind Pig,"Pours a clear darker gold beautiful creamy dense white head, great lacing and retention.

Blind Pig,"The Pig, bottled 122321, pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a thick dense head and BIG bubbles of carbonation. If there's a better smelling American IPA, I haven't smelled it yet. Floral and fruity it smells awesome. Tastes fabulous. Floral and fruity, slightly citrus the hops are perfection. WOW! So impressive. Mouthfeel is perfection. The lingering hop bitterness is absolutely righteous. Overall this is what IPA dreams are made of. The hops are just extraordinary in this wonderful blend.

An excellent balanced IPA with nice malt and bitter hop balance, a citrus and pine treat.",4.04
Blind Pig,Very bright and citrusy nose with a slight pine. Very nice bite with a quick hit of pine and ending with a citrusy bitterness. Kinda the opposite of Pliny which I found to be more pine dank aftertaste. Its definitely the younger brother of pliny but its still amazing. Definitely has the same elements in it just not as much.

Thanks to Donald for this surprise box!

Mostly clear gold but with a little chill haze, and a classic west coast head; bone white at 2 fingers, leaving gorgeous lace destroying the glass as it recedes gradually.

Aroma brings forward slight papery oxidation, with slight onion skin, dusty pine flooring, grapefruit rind, and dead hop leaves. I do not detect any yeast, malt, or ethanol in this beer. It is cutting and dirty and bitter smelling. It's a change from what I'm used to, but also brings me back to when IPAs were all emulating the giants like RR.

Flavor doesn't hit until about mid-palate. When that happens it brings sawdust first, then a little evergreen, then some onion skin, a tiny presence of crisp caramel malt, and then some papery oxidation. After you swallow it however, the flavor really shines. It sticks to your tongue and cheeks and roof, and sucks all moisture out. Then, seemingly suddenly, a wave of resiny bitterness and sweet honey take over and the oils take hold, pounding your palate with lupulin gland again and again. The finish is literally 10x as long as the beer itself, and takes time to dry on your palate. Then a whole new world opens up.

Feel is resiny, oily, very carbonated, with no alcohol anywhere in sight. Palate punisher, this one, as the oils destroy and scrub every taste bud from your mouth.

Overall, an impressive one to be sure, and it's easy to write paragraphs about it. This is one that should be in the books (and probably is), right along side its cousin Pliny, and has every right to be studied and emulated. This is a true west coast IPA in every sense of the word.

Exemplary.",4.33
Blind Pig,"Looks literally exactly the same as Pliny the Elder (had them side by side): beautiful, crystal-clear, light-amber-gold, with a big and pillowy head of bright white bubbles. Lots of splotches and streaks of lacing down the glass. Great looking beer. After that, the experience is very much like a muted and somewhat watered-down Pliny — some nice notes and well-crafted, but not really a standout. Piney, bright, citrusy, with solid bitterness, a lot of grassiness, some soapiness, and a touch of malt-sweetness. West Coast IPA all the way, with heavy grapefruit, but boarding on APA (for me) in terms of aroma and taste profile.

Crisp and refreshing but not particularly noteworthy.",3.97
Golden Monkey,"From the bottom of the can: ""BEST BY JUL 13 24 PBG 22194 14:38 FL""

Appearance: The body is a pretty medium shade of gold. It has pretty good clarity with only a slight bit of haze. The head is massive, creamy textured, and slightly off-white with a bit of an eggshell appearance. It has very good head retention and very nice sheets of creamy lacing on the glass.

Aroma: There is a bit of a banana aroma to the beer with a touch of an old paper scent. After the glass is agitated a bit there is a hint of a white pepper character that comes through.

Taste: Up front there is banana and a light bit of coriander. Towards the middle of the mouth there is a very light touch of clove mixed with more of that banana flavor. It has a very mellow sweetness that is balanced well with the beer. The flavor doesn't transform to the back of the mouth or in the aftertaste and stays mostly banana with a light hint of clove at times.

Mouthfeel: It is very smooth and easy to drink. Carbonation feels a little on the light side but the body of the beer still feels great. It has very high drinkability and it hides the alcohol well.

Overall: It is a really well made beer. The can states that this has a ""Belgian yeast character of banana and clove"" and they really hit the nail on the head with that description. The beer has a pleasant banana flavor with just a light touch of perceived sweetness that feels balanced. It is enjoyable to drink. I would recommend it and I would buy it again.",3.88
Golden Monkey,"Surprisingly good American take on a Tripel. Purchased a six pack of 12oz bottles and sampling in a tulip glass.

Allowed bottle to warm to 50F before pouring. Little to no head and very little lacing. On the nose, I am getting faint bananas and cloves with a background note of caramel. Taste is actually very yeast and malt forward, with a higher-than-usual sweetness and a clean lighter hop finish (Tettnang, maybe?). Subdued, but present, alcohol taste, which is not out of place for the style. Some black pepper notes on the tongue, which is present in my favorite Belgians.

It is the mouthfeel that throws it off, for me. For the style, it feels much thinner than I expected. If it was not so thin, I think that it would drink a little slower. Somehow, this is an almost crushable tripel, which is just as dangerous as it sounds. Allowing this to sit in the glass and warm up a bit, it becomes more balanced, and I get some slightly floral notes and a slightly improved mouthfeel.

Honestly, for the price, it exceeded expectations. I would have no problem buying it again, although I would not say it is the best in the style. However, it might be my favorite of American tripels, so far.",4.1
Golden Monkey,"Poured from 12 oz bottle into tulip glass. A 1"" off white head drops slowly, no lacing. Color is golden amber. Aroma of banana, clove and other spices. Mouthfeel is medium with dry finish. Flavor bursts with clove, allspice, earthy hops, yeast rolls. Overall: lots of flavor but not necessarily a situation of more=better. It's very good but not excellent. I probably would not buy this particular tripel again for that reason.",3.57
Golden Monkey,"October 9th, 2016 - A classic, but well worth reviewing again. Those Belgian esters hit softly but with definition, coaxing the olfactory with pear, banana (peel) and clove, with a richness that is intoxicating. The flavor is even better, translating those esters into a chorus of fruit flavors, and some nice spicy garnishes. I find pear, cinnamon and custard, with a little pepper for an unexpected kick. There's a reason this has been around for so long. Here's to hoping it's around in another decade.",4.05
Golden Monkey,"Tried this beer on a recommendation from a friend who originally sent me some Victory Beer in a beer box. To me, it tastes great and the ABV is in the mid-upper range that I like to start with.

Golden Monkey,"Fairly light head. Smell is sweet; banana and bubblegum, esters, coriander, cloves. Taste follows; sweet slightly caramel malt, banana, a hint of orange peel and citrus hops, becoming bubblegum and fruit esters, finishing with plenty of cloves and coriander. The alcohol is quite present; finish is dry. Not bad, but a bit too sweet and too reliant on the presence of spices for me.",3.74
Golden Monkey,"clear yellow with a short & short lived head with a faint aroma of banana, clove, and candied orange peel

Monkey tastes of banana, clove, candied orange peel, pear juice, with a peppery hit at the end.

not a bad tripel for the price",3.65
Golden Monkey,"Originally when I had my first Golden Monkey it was in a Victory mix pack. That mix pack had hop devil, prima pils, another victory beer I can't remember and golden monkey. I remember dreading having to drink Golden Monkey and would often split it with someone rather than waste it. The bottom line, I was out of touch with the world of Belgian style beers. Long story short, over time, Golden Monkey ascended to one of my favorite styles. This is a clean, spicy, and dry finish beer that leaves you with a warm happiness.",4.52

Oh man, how the hell have I never reviewed this one? This was a big one that pulled me into craft before my legal drinking days. I would also wager that it was my first Belgian-esque beer, but I can’t say for sure. Enough talk, rime for a proper review of this classic

Pours a cloudy gold with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves decent lacing

There’s not a whole lot going on in the nose, just a nice balance of spice and fruit. I’m picking up on aromas of clove, overripe banana, white pepper, orange rind, and bready malt

There’s a bit more going on in taste, and it’s a bit sweeter than the aroma especially on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, white pepper, grassy hops, crackery malt, banana, and light coriander. The swallow brings notes of candi sugar, toffee, clove, overripe banana, bready malt, apple skin, and orange rind

A medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer with a bit of bite. Finishes neutral but a bit too sweet

This is a good beer, but after years it pales in comparison to other Tripels and Belgian beers in general. Still, I’ll always have a soft spot in my heart for this one",3.85

Storm King,"Label says best by Oct 22, 2022. Interesting since an imperial stout can get better with age.
reviews i've read lead me to expect something different in the nose, but the sweet, dark candy smell, betrays nothing about this being any different from any other Impy stout. The opaque blackness topped with a thin, offwhite foam also seem normal. The only deviation is the additional bitterness of the hops, which only appear to me in the taste, rather than in the smell. Its noticably drier than I'd expect, and the alcohol is well hidden. Hops dominate later in the taste.
Its a nice change, but, to me, a minor flourish rather than a major deviation from the style. The mouthfeel is light, but chewy. Overall, very nice, and at a comfortable price point for an imperial stout.",4.37

Mouth feel is medium-full, rather soft and creamy even with a tight carbonation present. The alcohol is hidden pretty well. Overall, I'm glad they brought this back.

So this is one of those classic beers that everyone in the forums talks about quite often. All that talking must've done some good, because Victory decided to bring this one back for this year. My last beer to close out a wonderful Chirstmas I just had. Let's crack it open

Pours a very dark brown with 2 fingers of tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Upon first whiff of this, there's no question that this an old school Imperial Stout, just loaded with bitter roasty aromas. I'm picking up on aromas of charred toast, dark chocolate, roasted malt, acidic coffee, earthy hops, and light toffee

Oof, it's possibly even more roasty in taste. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, bitter coffee, earthy hops, toffee, and light grapefruit rind. The swallow brings notes of char, caramel malt, toast, dark chocolate, herbal hops, pithy grapefruit, and acidic coffee

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a roasty and bitter beer. Finishes mostly dry with a huge roast character

This beer is definitely a product of the time when it was popular, and it's pretty damn good for that. Drinks easy for what it is",4.12
Storm King,"So this stout is very interesting to me, since it uses European malts and American hops. I read some reviews about this stout that were much older, stating that it tasted more like a black IPA than a stout, but I disagree with this assessment. It tastes like a European imperial stout to me, with cocoa, slight coffee, a bit of bread, and a little bit of a hop bite, but really can't tell that the hops create any outstanding bitterness. Certainly not a thin beer, but certainly not the thickets beer I've ever had, and quite dry on the aftertaste.. I really enjoy it, but it's not as good when warm as some other thicker stouts. Overall, great stout, but better when served up slightly on the cold side. If you want something to drink at room temp, this probably isn't it.",4.24

Storm King,"Appearance:
The type of brown called to mind by an untamed forest, thick with brawny tree trunks, swallowed up in the darkness of its own, impermeable canopy; nightfall immersing it in sightless black. Oh, it has a head too… Right. Got a little carried away there. It’s a lush, wonderful head of pale, sandy froth with long-lived retention and lace that starts as a sheet, then breaks into cobwebs.

Bouquet:
Smoked oats, coated in a chocolate that’s never even heard the word “sugar,” let alone mixed with it. The backend yields dark malts and miniscule, earthy hops, pulverized into powdery dryness.

Feel:
So plush and thick, it’s like chewing on a satin quilt—but in this case, pretend the quilt is edible and chewing on it is not the result of mental derangement. A weave on low carbonation provides a bit of fiber-like contrast to the texture… Hmm, I’m not really selling you here, am I? Look, its good okay. Full bodied and smokier than a volcanic plume. Drink it and instantly gain +100 Manly Points.

Taste:
A billowing cloud of woodsmoke engulfs the palate, leaving the tongue to blindly trip over dark, earthy hops, bang its shins on blocks of raw cacao, and fall, gratefully, onto a pillow of soft oats at the end.",3.93

Pours an opaque black with about two and a half fingers of tan head. Great retention, great lacing.

Smells mainly of roasted/smoky malts with a hint of coffee and baker's chocolate.

Taste is bitter dark chocolate with strong roasty/smoky notes. Touch of coffee in there too.

Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style but still pretty full-bodied. This is a different kind of IS than the RISs I'm used to. Strong bitter aftertaste that lingers for a long time. Low to medium carbonation.

This is really a decent beer. A little different than what I'm used to but a great change of pace. Glad Victory brought this one back.",4.12
Storm King,"Perfection incarnate for me. This is exceptional - seriously. I think one of my favorite beers has to be Alchemist's Luscious. I don't get up to VT more than once (maybe twice) a year. I have a couple stowed away to enjoy this holiday season from a summer trip - I love that stuff but this is so reminiscent. Stylistically, profile, aesthetic. It's quite a surprise for me. What I'm trying to say is, this to me fills the luscious void in a sense. Price point is excellent as well. Man, what a beer. Big, bold, bitter, luscious stuff. I suspect there's something of cascade in here - that hop just becomes what you need it to. I dunno, this is wonderful stuff though. Grab it.",4.92
Storm King,"L: Jet black body with a finger of brown head.
S: aromas of coffee, espresso, hazelnut, and roasted nuts
T: big time coffee/espresso notes, followed by a nice hop finish with a touch of bitterness

O: outstanding, underrated in my opinion",4.25
Storm King,"pours a deep cola brown-near-black body with a tan foam head that has low retention and leaves occasional thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin murky cap with occasional thick bubbles and a thick defined halo

aroma is clear, thick and rich molasses sweetness with thin licorice herbal hop and mocha

taste is espresso with dark fruit underpinnings and that herbal licorice tinged hop; dark chocolate is kinda buried here but in there with the roasted malt; resinous pine underlying

mouthfeel is somewhat thin bodied with robust carbonation; comes across like carbonated espresso with pillowy bitter prickles throughout and a dry, hopped finish with an herbal, licorice tinged hop and robust dark chocolate and espresso aftertaste

overall:
straight up carbonated espresso beer. pretty great and somewhat complicated and tinged with resinous pine and lowkey herb. pretty great overall, but lacking balance",4.31
Storm King,"I’m not sure how this beer gets such a high rating. Ether I’m wrong and need to study beer more to understand it or everyone else is wrong. Or I can just simply have a different opinion which is probably the case. We will go with the last one I guess. I get nothing on the nose other than a slight burnt toast scent. The taste is of burnt soap or a semi cheep cup of coffee. Mouth feel seems non existent. I think Victory can do better than this by a long shot.

After I wrote what I said above, I saw a comment below saying that it is more of a black lager and yes!!! That’s it!! The post even said if it is a black lager than it is a good black lager! This is indeed a wonderful black lager and not a stout. Shame they call it a stout. It is the hops that add too much of a bitterness for a stout without the maltiness, yet for a black lager it is perfect.

Strange how names can make all the difference.",2.55
Storm King,"Imperial stout 9.1 abv with relatively high IBU at 65. This is a style of imperial stout I really enjoy, and it shares the heritage of North Coast's venerable Old Rasputin. Glad I found this one. Bought a 6-pack of 12-Oz bottles and went back for the case. In PA this one is $40 per case of 25 or $10.49/6-pack, and an exceptional deal. Appearance: Black, tan head, good lacing. Taste: Strong coffee, caramel, malts, balanced bitterness to offset the stout sweetness and clean finish. No alcohol heat or odor, so be careful with this one. It's a seasonal favorite.",4.71
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,"Pours black with a couple fingers of khaki foam. Aroma is sticky resin, with toasty and roasty malts underneath. Sticky, but dark, with earthy undertones. Flavor profile is sticky resin and mild dank hops, with roasty and toasty malts underneath. Caramel and earthy flavors build as the beer warms. It's a really sticky IPA, but with dark stout undertones. Mouth feel is medium-thick with a mild velvet, fluffy texture. Very low grit. Overall, sticky dark beer, which is always a juxtaposition, but in a favorable way.

Served in a 15.5oz Spiegelau tulip from a 12oz bottle. Reviewed from notes.",4.13

Great flavor combination with the piney hops and dark malt. Always a place for this beer.",4.3
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,"I’m very impressed with Stone for this one—most Stone IPAs have the same exact generic bitterness; however, this one is different; this one has a balanced hop flavor, balanced bitterness, and is oh-so-smooth. Pours a dark brown like the color of the glass bottle it came in, yet looks basically black poured into a glass. Has a head you would expect from a darker beer like this…the head dissipated but still left a thin lingering layer…the lacing is wonderful. The 8.7% ABV is extremely well-hidden in this brew. Honestly—this does leave your tongue longing for more sip after sip, with the melody of flavors. I’m about 2/3 done with this 1 pt 6 oz bottle and I have no idea why I’m already feeling buzzed. Nice work on a unique brew, Stone. Try it while you can as it is a limited re-release.",5.0

Aroma was actually hoppy for me, which was surprising as most black “IPAs” are more malty than hoppy.

12 oz. can dated 12/22/21 - 8.7% ABV / 90 IBU
Brewed and canned in Richmond, VA
Poured into a Bell's branded tulip snifter glass

Look - Pours a thick and dense light tan head that leaves lacing. Pitch black appearance with small amounts of light coming through revealing a reddish hue.
Smell - Not getting much aroma from the beer while it's cold. Maybe some toasted malt. As the beer warms, there's the scent of pine, grapefruit, coffee, and faint dark fruit coming forth.
Taste - Initial taste is charred malt and pine that brings a nice bitterness. Getting light chocolate and citrus flavors as the beer warms. Also getting dark fruit and berry qualities. Can't detect any alcohol flavor.
Feel - Medium bodied with a sharp mouthfeel and you can feel the booze burn on the back of the tongue. Has a fairly dry finish.
Overall - Nice hop flavors that balance well with the smoky malt. Easy to drink despite the high ABV.",4.47
Sublimely Self-Righteous Black IPA,"Clear, very dark brown, near black with a substantial foamy tan head that persists and produces some nice lacing.
The aroma is pine resin and caramel with some notes of raisin and plum.

The body is solidly medium, very smooth, good carbonation level.

Palo Santo Marron,"Im sampling this 12 oz bottle at cellar temp poured into my snifter. This bottle is about 7 years old and has been in my cellar for most of its life. The beer pours black coffee color with no light passing through the glass. Very minimal tan head foams up and remains a thin edge layer throughout sampling. I leave maybe a ml in the bottle as there are some sediment chunks that Im not interested in.
The aroma is rich and complex malt profile. I get brown sugar, some vanilla, and rich woody notes. I also get a little booze and hints of port in the background. I also do get just a wisp of oxidation cardboard buried. glad I opened now and not next year!
First sip reveals a medium body with mild yet still slightly tingly carbonation. Texture is definitely sticky and coats my lips and palate with each sip. Flavor is deep malt with brown sugar, some tobacco, dark cocoa powder, and wood. Finish actually also has a little dark fruit and some booze. No hop character anywhere and I dont get any oxidation on the flavor profile. I do find this to be a sipping beer due to the texture and slight booziness on the finish. Interesting and enjoyable, but I need to go back and get a fresh bottle to remind myself of what it tastes like without aging.",4.13

Palo Santo Marron,"Instead of the strict five point review format, I'm just gonna tell it like it is.

This beer is and in-depth, syrupy mouthful of deliciousness, especially when comparing it to your average pint of not-nearly-as-heavy brown ale. I bought a 4 pack of bottles on a trip (bottled 10/09/20, drinking it on 1/8 and drinking it at whatever appropriate temperature for this type of beer, fuck fussing about degrees F) and it's an excellent beer. Very little noticeable carbonation and all of those dank, roasty, delicious flavors I love in a brown ale whether exceptionally heavy or as light as newcastle.

For sure, worth an excellent review in my eyes",4.81
Palo Santo Marron,"It smells like a sweet steaming loaf of decadent brown bread on some exotic wooden cutting board with a bottle of smokeless scotch opened just next to it.

It has the taste of a ball of dough rolled in rich and bitter cocoa nibs. Once that slightly fades you can taste some wood that a little alcohol has been spilled on.

It feels smooth like hot cocoa down to the fact that it warms your mouth with the high alcohol content. Mild carbonation prickles a little and when you swallow you're left with a dry and clean bitterness.

Overall it's really interesting. I like it and it's unique. I give it a 5.3 out of 6.",4.44
Palo Santo Marron,"Deep brown appearance with a large, dense, tan head and good lacing. Aroma is a mix of molasses, chocolate and vanilla extract over the wood. Sweet, roasted malt flavors along with some dark fruit. Hops take their time to clock in and you may have to wait a bit for them to register. Full bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel. Lingering, sweet, slightly cloying finish. Alcohol was warming but approached the 12% in a stealthy fashion.",4.13

smell: one of the best parts. the palo santo marron wood of course gives it some woody scent (redwood? rosemary?), but also a very savory char. like a BBQ smoker

taste: soy sauce, barbecue sauce, salami, rosemary, thyme, sage. i can't get over how savory this is. i don't even get a ton of acutal oak or wood, it just tastes like someone stacked their smoker with some very tasty wood, and made a bunch of meat. it's not a campfire beer, it's a barbecue beer, in that it tastes like a whole meal

Palo Santo Marron,"Bottles 4/24/20

I actually set one of these aside in the cellar before drinking a freah one, pretty sure it’s a 2019 and I plan on drinking it next year for my college graduation

Pours a rich dark brown with a finger of khaki head that reduces to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

Aromas of toasted malt, caramel, vanilla, and light milk chocolate. Really just a touch of oak but nothing spectacular

The taste starts off charred, more roasty like a stout. Some intense vanilla and rich malt with dark roast coffee. The milk chocolate comes out on the finish

Quite the light feel for a brown but still full in flavor with moderate carbonation leads to a smooth and nearly dry finish

This was not exactly what I was expecting, I wanted my mind to be blown. I guess that ones on me, but I’ve heard it gets better with age. I’ll have to set aside other beers for graduation too, but this will be nice
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So, the day has finally come. I graduated from college with a Bachelors degree in Mechanical Engineering earlier today (okay, yesterday really) and now it's time to whip out a bottle of this I've had for a while dated 4/12/19. Let's dive right in

Still looking the same in color but with a slightly bigger head and more lacing (3.75->4)

Holy hell, the wood in this older bottle is significantly more present. I'm picking up on aromas of toasted oak, pecan, creamy vanilla, espresso beans, brown bread, and subtle milk chocolate (4.25->4.5)

Honestly this tastes pretty similar to what I have noted from the fresh bottle, just a little less roasty and charred. Maybe it could actually use some more time in this regard (4->4)

The body remains identical here, but I do think it deserves a slight bump up from before (4->4.25)

Overall this has to go (4->4.25). This definitely impressed me more than it did initially, but I think setting another bottle aside would be fun to see how the taste evolves",4.2
Palo Santo Marron,"Pours deep copper with a 1/4 inch wispy, tan head. Light lacing.

Palo Santo Marron,"Very dark, appealing brown ale. Almost totally opaque like a stout. Smells great! Smokey, roasted caramel scent with some vanilla aromas. Very flavorful, complex brew, but it's a little too sweet. It feels a little syrupy and thick, unfortunately. It's a great beer for someone who has been dabbling in the waters of craft brewing and enjoys darker, sweeter beers!",3.83
Palo Santo Marron,"This brewery, they do as they please, because they’re established and have the following to do so. I personally commend them for making beer that nobody else would. With that being said sometimes it’s too over the top and that’s the case with this brown ale. I’ve never seen a Brown Ale with such a high ABV. It’s too over powering and doesn’t drink like any brown ale I’ve had. Honestly if they toned this down a bit , could be a really amazing brown. Worth a try but not high on my repeat list.",4.13
Lunch,"Appearance: Slightly hazy gold, frothy white head with very good retention.

Aroma: Tropical fruit and berry. Not aromas we quite muted, got no citrus or pine.

Flavor: Hop forward, flavor follows aroma. Moderate bitterness

Mouth feel: Medium body, creamy smooth.

Overall: I was actually a little disappointed, but this sample was about 3 months old. Aromas and flavors were more muted than I expected. I got berry and tropical fruit but very little citrus and no pine per the description. It can be hard to find Maine Beer Co in my area that is less than 60 days old unless you just get lucky. While it did not live up to the hype, I enjoyed this more than most IPA's because the bitterness balanced sweetness well, didn't overwhelm and destroy the palate. It has a nice creamy, smooth mouth-feel. 7% abv is very well hidden, would not know it is that high. Enjoyable beer, but was very overpriced for what I got. Based on price/enjoyment I would not purchase again simply because it is expensive.",3.95
Lunch,"16.9 oz bottle dated 5/22/22. Poured into a pint glass, fridge temp.
Orange gold, short fluffy white head.
Fresh green piney hop smell with grapefruit and citrus notes.

Feel is on the light side of medium, smooth, medium bubbles.
Overall, good fresh beer, price point is OK, this is a simple and unpretentious glass of good.",4.24
Lunch,"An easy pour from a 1 Pint .9FL. OZ. bottle released a fat finger of creamy white foam with long retention and thin rings of lacing. Translucent dark yellow straw color appears golden in bright light.

Citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pine greets the nose, toast and cracker in the background. Somewhat dank, hints at being sweet.

Semi-dry with medium-high bitterness, malty and juicy-but not too juicy. Lemon and grass are added to the hop profile, a Kolsch-like wine and grape flavor emerges. A hint of caramel and toasted grain joins the malt. The finish is fast with malt and juice flavor dropping off, citrus and piney hops with a peppery bite linger a while.

Medium light bodied with ample carbonation, boldly flavored yet balanced and smooth. Alcohol is cleverly hidden.
True to style with clean and fresh taste. Born on date 31MAY22, 69 days old.",4.43

Lunch,"500ml bottle, about a month old

Pours two massive fingers of fluffy white head into my Willi glass. Retention is pretty good, and half a finger of head remains after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks pretty nice. Body is a hazy orange, with a hefty amount of bubbles coming up. Looks pretty good so far.

Nose is pretty tame - citrus rind, mandarin oranges, some sweetness. The orange comes out a little more with heavy agitation. Smells good enough.

The flavor is not much different. Light citrus, some orange.

That said, the mouthfeel completely transforms this beer. Carbonation is on the higher side. Body is somewhat light - drinks much lighter than 7%. A very small touch of sweetness; finishes very clean. Bitterness is medium. This is crisp, wet, and incredibly refreshing. Outstanding mouthfeel.

Drinkability is off the charts good.

Appearance turned out pretty nice. Lacing was cohesive for the most part, and some foam hung around to the bottom.

This feels like a pale ale that got crossed between the east and west coast. Has the look of an east coast, crispness of a west coast, and weight of a pale. On its own, the flavor is ok, but the mouthfeel really accentuates and elevates that. Very nice beer.",4.2
Lunch,"From the bottle's neck, it smells like an IPA but more nuanced. Like hoppy bubble gum. Pours a bright amber color with a large, long, retainful off-white head.
Very smooth, hoppy, malty, and refreshing. Candied hops and sweet malts. Occasionally bitter resin notes come out and are soon overridden by its general smoothness. The tropical notes take a bit more of a back seat, but they're there, particularly with some orange rind, melon, with the addition of some slightly herbal or peppery notes. Well carbonated till the end. The only thing I can compare it to is Pliny the Elder. Good beer, I would definitely enjoy again.",4.46
Lunch,"16.9oz bottle purchased off the shelf for $6.99 (on sale for $1 off) plus a 5 cent deposit and 8.62% sales tax. Bottled on 7/14/22, so this is exactly one month old.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a translucent haze. There was a thick, off-white head with compact to medium bubbles that slowly reduced to a very thin layer.

Smell: Aromas of tropical fruit (papaya), stone fruit (apricot, mango), citrus (grapefruit), and pine. Unmistakable green bell pepper aroma. I also get an interesting creamy vanilla note on the nose.

Taste: This is extremely drinkable. This beer has a nice caramel malt backbone to complement the hoppiness. It has a dry finish, which is mild to moderately bitter. The bitterness does not linger on the palate for so long. The finish also has a nice orange zest note along with some spiciness. Pine resin on the finish as well.

Feel: Medium bodied with a very soft mouthfeel. Appropriately carbonated.

Overall: Maine Beer Company does it again. They know how to make very tasty beer!

From the website:
Flavor profile: Aromas of orange, grapefruit, and lemon with pine and herbal undertones. Tropical notes of guava and papaya with subtle caramel and malt sweetness.

Lunch,"Went to our newest wine store in town, couldn’t believe they had it, and was the last one! This is a very easy drinking IPA. Seems like a West Coast and New England had a baby.

S: Honeyed melon, white grape, dank grass, subtle tangerine, pine, and cracker malt.
T: Dank grass, honeyed melon, white grape, white pepper, soft and bitter pine resin, tangerine, dry cracker malt, and subtle lemon, earthy, and floral notes. Nice complexity!
M: Light body. Dry throughout with citrus and other fruit sweetness, mildly bitter with subtle earthy and spice elements. Delicate cracker malt backbone. Excellent balance!
D: Wow! What an outstanding APA/IPA (seems to sit right on the border between the two). Superb for style.",4.67
Lunch,"Appearance: Yellow/Blonde glass with serious chill haze. Holds a halo of white foam that leaves a few wisps of lace.

Aroma: Lemongrass hop note, some crystal malt base, mild overall.

Taste: Gentle profile, light slightly earthy, slightly pine hop bitterness blends with a full malt base, slight perfume floral note, little tonic water finish.

Mouthfeel: Slight grit in a silky base, medium heavy carbonation, medium body.

Overall: A little underwhelmed given the big scores it gets. It's a fine beer, just very East Coast in my book. Hops just didn't pop, not nearly citric enough for me, leaving this more of an APA ranged beer. It shipped from Virginia, arrived very warm, that might have taken some of the bloom off of the hops, I'd be happy to try again but I don't see the bones of a great whale here. Still a good catch.",3.92
Lunch,"Poured from a bottle into my tulip glass.

Look: Pretty dark straw head with a thick foamy head. Body itself is crisp but also has slightest tinge of haze.

Smell: Pine, candied orange.

Taste: Orange hops, Some vegetal/grassy notes, even slight onion mid palate. Some graham cracker malt (think honeyed Teddy grahams). Dank pine and grapefruit, sight peppery alcoholic finish. Hoppy but very well balanced.

Feel: Medium bodied, very drinkable.

Drinking a 2 week old Lunch is one of the more pleasant beer experiences I've had in a while. Would love to try this on tap. Awesome beer, well worth seeking out.",4.44

Brown Shugga',"Wowser, this is a pretty stout Am Strong Ale!! For me, it is is a bit overpowering with the initial bite and then the finish is a bit bitter. It is a really good beer for this style, but I cannot say that I find it to be a great beer. I know that is weak but that is just due to my taste. As always, I recommend you try this (if interested in the style) and form your own opinion.",3.89
Brown Shugga',Pours a copper color with a foamy tan head that lasts quite a while. No discernable aroma. Tastes of brown sugar. Starts out sweet but finishes with a hoppy bitterness.,4.02
Brown Shugga',"Bottling code from September 2019

Dark translucent copper, one finger of beige head, clumpy lacing. partial cap, variegated bubbles.
Caramel, dates, dark honey, spice cake aromas
Light hop tart orange citrus, pine, yet also brown sugar, and caramel flavors
Substantial body, alcohol noticeable, initial hop bite, but nice balance that drinks too quickly. Lingering hop tingle. Carbonation dissipates steadily but is stubborn given the ABV.
Evergreen standby in the winter months.",4.09
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"A bit surprised I had never reviewed this beer before.

Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Rich dark brown color with great beige head and nice curtain lacing.smell and taste of dark chocolate and roasted malt. Clean, not overpowering taste. Rich, smooth feel. I wish I had another bottle!",4.19
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Poured from a 16 oz can into a Wilmington Brewing Company Can Glass

The beer pours nearly pitch black with only the lightest ruby highlights, and about two fingers of dense light tan head that slowly recedes into a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a minimal amount of lacing

The aroma is dark & milk chocolate, coffee, and some roasted malts. Very pleasant and inviting.

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The chocolate is complimented with the roasted malts. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and more pronounced milk chocolate flavors. Light/medium bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, that is very smooth and easy to drink. Quite enjoyable",4.01

Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Pours a very deep, dark brown. The look is black, but held to a light you can see the deep ruby shades going through. No beer so far that’s been nitro’d has the ability to pour as big a nitro head as Guinness — but Young’s comes very close, with a thick, dense finger tall head that looks a little more watery and a little more creamy than other nitro stouts. Hard to ever rate nitro beers low on the looks department.

Wonderful aromas of dark chocolate, chocolate dust, cacao beans, roasted coffee, caramelized sugar in sticky toffee pudding, and light burnt and toasty malts. What can you say? It’s good!

Taste follows the nose, but is regrettably more watery with a thinner body than the nose suggests. They do not lie about the chocolate, dark chocolate intermingles with milk chocolate on the finish, which is a bit sweeter. Gentle bitterness from the roasted malt on the front. Earthy with a nice almond-esque nuttiness throughout.

Based on the style I’m almost tempted to say this is a lighter bodied stout but I’d say it’s square in the medium bodied category. This is straight up nitrogenated, there is barely even a tickle of the tiny bubbles on the palate. Not quite flat, however, this creates a very very smooth mouthfeel. As smooth as you can possibly get, even more than other nitro stouts. Semi-dry finish that leans to the sweet side.

I will be honest, I came into the review a little disappointed. I am used to Young’s like the picture on BA, the nice dark glass in the regular carbonation. Ironically, I actually love nitro stouts. But years ago when I first started drinking good beers, I loved to split Young’s with a friend. One of the first real chocolate stouts on the market, and it was so good. Not sure if I’ll ever find a bottled one again.

That all being said, this was still not bad. You sacrifice certain aspects and bolder flavours for the smoother ride of the nitro when you go for the widget can. This is still a remarkable beer, one that is actually pretty easy drinking for people used to stouts and nitros. Could easily have a few in a night. The flavours are subtle but varied and complex enough to make a great beer.",3.9
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly black, color with a moderate light tan head. SRM of 22-23. (3.75)

Aroma: Mild aromas of English cocoa, bittersweet chocolate, cocoa nibs, some earthy black malts. Smooth lactose. (3.75)

Flavor: Smooth flavors of bittersweet chocolate upfront. Some tobacco & smoke. This smooths into a milk chocolate, dark malt, and creamy lactose on the end. (3.75)

Feel: Lighter bodied. Low carbonation. Drinks sort of flat with tobacco bitterness and cocoa lingering on the finish. (3.50)

Compared to Founders' Porter 3/7/22: Pours a similar color, milder and lighter head. Milder aromas. More bittersweet chocolate, tobacco bitterness. Less chocolate, espresso, lactose. Lighter body.

Overall: An English Stout for sure with the bittersweet chocolate and tobacco notes intermixed with the chocolate. Lighter-bodied and under-carbonated in my opinion. Has the English flavors, but that was about the only thing I found enlightening about this beer. (Final Rating: 3.73)",3.73
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"4pk of 12oz bottles (Best before 23 JAN22) picked up at the Arundel Preserve Wine and Spirit: Hesitated a long time prior to trying this, ""Double Chocolate"" sounded like way too much chocolate. Frankly, could barely smell it and even that might have been ""peer pressure"". More, but thankfully NOT overwhelming chocolate on the tongue with some malt thrown in. A smooth drinker, but I don't think I'll be coming this way again anytime soon.",3.8
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,The pour was a very smooth dark chocolaty pour. The smell reminds me of a very strong malt chocolaty smell on the nose. The taste was actually very surprising as you could taste the malts and chocolates. Over all this stout is very unique in it's own way and I would definitely enjoy a bottle every weekend!!!,4.78
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Pours a beautiful, inviting head with aromas similar to a chocolate milk, rather than chocolate itself. On the palate, the beer is much more straight forward with a heavy blend of both milk and dark chocolate qualities and roasted malts, much to my surprise of the rather subtle aroma. Moderate carbonation with a perfect lingering finish. Extremely creamy and smooth; like a Nitro brew. The smoothest beer I've had which actually blows my mind. Beautiful combination of a strong chocolate taste without being too heavy or sweet, which comes unexpected from the much lighter aroma.",4.23
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Pours jet black with a 0.5"" tan head, settling out to a solid ring, nice streaky lacing. Nose is chocolate milk, chocolate syrup, and light roast. Taste is milk chocolate, a bit of bitter baking chocolate, and some deeper roast notes. Mouthfeel on the thin side, but helps avoid this from getting too heavy. Delivers noticeable chocolate flavor without becoming overly sweet or heavy. Warrants respect for its subtlety.",3.76
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"I've had this beer in both cans and bottles. The cans I purchased locally in winter '19-20 and found that the taste was negatively effected. It was slightly metallic. While in London at a Young's pub in summer 2019, I had a 500 ml bottle. It was very nice -- smooth, creamy, with chocolate notes. I was surprised it was not on draft, but perhaps it was because it was summer. Still, it was a cool and rainy day in mid-June.",4.03
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Look: This was poured from widget can, so the bottle pour might be very different. Pours a rich dark brown on hair below black. Pours like a Guiness with all the seperation expected. BIg 2 finger tawny head. The head lasts forever still a finger high at 5 minutes. The head is dense and marshmellow like. Sticky as can be.

Smell: Dark chocolate, but so subtle. Maybe the head is holding it in but way to subtle to be appreciated.

Taste: Watery up front, both dark and milk chocolate, with hints of almond nuttiness.

This beer is a total enigma. Phenomenal look, disappointing smell, decent taste, and a mouthfeel that starts out weak but picks up some steam in the end. As a big fan of chocolate stouts, this is kind of disappointing. I'd say this beer is far too muted. It earns a B-

Feel: Very watery up front, but it finishes with a creamy dryness.",3.47
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Pours similarly to a Guinness, just a lot darker. Smells mostly like cocoa, with a slight coffee aroma. The taste is very chocolaty, and with the bitterness of the beer, its like a very dark chocolate. Like an 80% dark chocolate. The beer is extremely creamy, and creates a wonderfully pleasant feeling. The perfect carbonation for a stout. Almost smoother than a nitro brew. This beer is very good and i would highly recommend it to a fan of stouts.",4.01
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Look: So dark that light can't pass through it. Like my soul :3c nice persistent foamy head
Smell: Chocolate (DUH ITS CALLED CHOCOLATE STOUT DUHHHHHHHHHH), tobacco, Bailey's
Taste: It has chocolate flavor, but is missing the creaminess that I personally associate chocolate with. Notes of malt and black coffee. Strong black coffee/dark chocolate aftertaste.
Feel: Not much carbonation. Pretty smooth and dry. Would not go on a second date with a man like this.
Overall: One of the better stouts I have drank, but I am not much of a stout cat. Its not too dry which I like, and the flavor is not intense so it is very drinkable.",3.4
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Looks great. Dark with smooth creamy head. The Widget really does its job. Scent is too weak, even taking into account the thick head. I liked the roasted slight hint of chocolate taste but I'm not a chocolate and coffee beer enjoyer. I feel for the style the chocolate could have been group out more prominent. Smooth perfect bitterness feel.",3.92
Young's Double Chocolate Stout,"Appearance - Pours a jet black with two fingers of creamy tan head.

Smell - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, coffee bean, earthy and leafy hops, dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig), and earthy yeast.

Taste - grainy roasty malts, cocoa, and coffee bean upfront. The earthy and leafy hops come through next followed by the dark fruits (raisin, plum, fig). The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes creamy with all elements lingering.

Overall - A flavourful sweet stout that delivers on all flavours. I am impressed on how velvety smooth this beer is with all the bold elements in it. A stand out in this category and deserving of a try from those that haven't sampled it yet.",4.18
Stella Artois,"Poured into a 2/3 pint glass . 4.6% UK brewed version .

Smell : Alcohol and slightly astringent

Looks :Closer to yellow than amber, a fingers width head that bubbled down completely. No lacing.

Taste : A slight sweetness that moves into a slightly too sharp bitterness that lasts long after the mouth full.

Mouth feel : Decent , not too thin or thick. Carbonation is extra fizzy , bordering on pop like.

Overall: To use a sports analogy Stella Artois is even par in golf . Nothing to be upset about , nothing great but nothing awful. You can do a lot better and a lot worse .",2.98
Stella Artois,"Had on tap at bout time pub & grub Arvada

On arrival the head was a bit disappointing, 1 finger of bone white average bubbles, that dissipated quickly to a vague ring. Body is a golden yellow, with lazy carbonation.

Aroma is light, with some vague and not very present euro bittering hops and a light light pale crackery malt. Very clean however.

Taste is once again pretty light but malts do come through clearly as malts, with just a bit of corniness. A light but clean and floral hop bitterness is present, but once again pretty light. There are some light esters in the mix, but I can't pinpoint quite weather it's off or just a quirk.

Feel is full bodied but drinkable. Not quite chuggable as it is quite filling, but it's a decent table beer. Medium finish and feels quite malty.

Overall if it was cheaper and less hyped up I'd like it a lot more, but for the impression it makes on non-beer drinkers I'd expect something a bit more crisp, amd refreshing. Everthing is there but I've certainly had a lot better. Closer to a hoppy American lager than a pils, although still better than a lot of euro cheapos.",3.21
Stella Artois,"If there is no Carlsberg, this is my go to beer. I also have fond memories related to this beer as it was my beer of choice during my college years so it holds a special place in my heart. Taste is exceptional, smells fresh and grainy and its golden colour is a thing of beauty.",4.55
Stella Artois,"Such a good beer this is my #1 goto.

Taste like a beer should taste, no added fancy flavors or crazy biterness, just a good European beer! Belgium sits between France and Germany, 2 countries who make arguably europes best beers. I can taste both influences, it is hard to describe. I have had atleast a thousand beers but I do not expect to find anything better than Stella. Good beer!",4.87
Stella Artois,"This used to be a pretty decent beer 20 years ago, as I recall, but now it is bad. Tastes like soap and burnt caramel with a hint of pee soaked diaper. I have never actually had a pee soaked diaper, but this must be what it tastes like. Very bad, embarrassingly bad. Not something I would ever want again. Really quite awful. Tart, metallic, oily, with a slight hint of barf. AVOID.",2.09
Stella Artois,"Color is a light gold color, with a fine white foam. Pulls a nice head but dissipates fast. Carbonation is decent. Smells citrusy, light and a hint malty. Flavor is ok. Light citrus note, malty and smooth. Fairly boring though. Overall its a alright easy drinker, nothing special but not bad.",3.73
Stella Artois,"From a can dated bb 3-23-23

Nice white sticky head with lace and clean looking pale gold color.

I'll get back to you on the smell, wheat crackers - orange rind hop notes, produce dept..

The malt is not too sweet but picks up a bit of honeyed barley, nice mild drying hops.

Smooth, slick, and refreshing with light carbonation.

I like this beer even compared to many $11 a six craft beers, yet when you get it on sale and get twice as much for the same price, well then it is really hard to beat.",3.53
Stella Artois,Mi!d aroma with nothing really coming foward. Taste was balanced without any distinguishing character. A bit thin feel with a not much aftertaste. A good middle of the road beer. Too bad we can't drink the recipe from 600 years ago.,3.16

After the first taste at the nearest pub in port we've been steady daily since then. I found it to be consistent worldwide until now. Can't explain but the tastes is off. St. Louis water source? Not as bad as canned Stella but I don't like it. Sorry girl I'm going to miss you.

Furious,"Poured from a can. Caramel in color with a large tan head and some lacing. Smells of pine, grapefruit, and caramel. Flavors are more towards the pine side with hints of citrus.",3.83
Furious,"First beer that I've had from Surly as I found this at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona while I was out there recently. Heard a lot about the Abrasive but this easily fit the bill as it was a wonderful IPA with a ton of body and flavor, as it nearly felt like an Amber / Red Ale!

Loved the chestnut hue to this as it was topped off by a *ton* of thick, bready head that stuck around and clung to the side of my pint glass, in the form of deep rings of lacing. A fine haze was in this as there was a ton of caramel, pine, and earthy hops in the nose with them being much stronger in the taste. Some herbal tea spice and bread rounded out the flavor as this was one to fly out of my glass quickly, as the carbonation was just light enough to keep this from feeling too heavy. Orange pith and deep earth emerged as this warmed up, as everything faded nicely once I finished this off.

This had a bit of booze, but nothing excessive, as it complemented the flavor profile quite nicely. Canned on 3/16, this looked and felt as fresh as could be with the impression of a tap beer that I'd easily have again. Loved this brew as it's easy to see why it's ranked so highly on here!",4.21

So much so, going back to baseline e.g., Two Hearted) is boring... I just want to drink another red Surly. It's the hoppy balance with a bit of bite (rye?). I live in Indiana. and wish they offered it in the Hoosier state.",4.81
Furious,"A tremendous IPA. It pours a deep amber color with strong lacing. Lots of citrus, with some sweetness like caramel or maybe butterscotch. And a truly smooth mouthfeel.",4.35
Furious,"Canned in October. No doubt the hops have shifted in their representation. Still an impressive hop forward IPA that pays homage to the left coast but establishes its on identity.

Huge head, tons of lace. Lots of pine and citrus What's really lovely is the Scottish malt base.

Nice amount of pine and citrus hits the nose with significant force. Good amount of biscuity malt.

Solid malt front is quickly subsumed by the huge hop component. Pine starts with a big and firm citrus follow through. Super clean and dry finish with a surprising amount of malt. Light hop oil.

Feel is solid and easy drinking. Solid carbonation and quenching swallow.

This reminds me a bit of the early West Coast IPAs like Pizza Port et al. Bigger and heavier malt backbone give it a distinctive personality. Hops are huge and all over this beer. A nice bookend to the other great midwest/heartland American IPA, Bells Two Hearted. Great overall brew. British malt, American hopping. Wonderful beer.",4.01
#9,"I personally love this beer, I saw alot of 3.75 rating which was a shock to me. This beer is a classic of the 90s and is still going strong for good reason. I am currently sipping one and I'm 32 years old. I remember seeing the cap with the hypnotizing swirl on it and witty sayings in the cap when I was just a kid. When I got older I started drinking these and understood why my parents loved them. I hope this beer stays around long enough for me to keep enjoying my childhood. As weird as that seems, with this beer and reading the caps it reminds me of the good times I once had when I was little growing up in the 90s. I miss that free spirit attitude everyone had and the beers taste helps me reminisce those awesome years.",5.0

Pretty decent Pale Ale. Less bitterness than an IPA.",3.92
#9,"It's a shame they are no longer at their Burlington, VT spot because I wish I could visit the once popular home to this wonderful serum. Anyways, a bronze liquid fills my glass with a foamy white head. Fairly standard appearance, but a wonderful aroma of apricot/fruity sweetness permeates the glass. A sip and you quite literally are mystified by this beer. What am I drinking? It's got a sweet flavor to it with an almost malty touch. A really crisp clean beer that is unique and hard to describe, but really what it is is delicious.",3.84

Faintly hazy pale amber body. No head retention, hence no lacing.

Not much of an aroma. Somewhat fruity.

On tasting, the fruit is there, with a fairly strong sour bitterness.

Mouth medium, finish sour bitterness

Overall, none too pleasant to this palate, and I dont think its age related.",3.42
#9,"Beer pours a little cloudy with a little head, and a few small particulates. Smells more like a fruity ale than an IPA (which I like). tastes pretty good in my opinion, but not as hoppy as a pale ale( perhaps that's why it says not quite pale ale on the front). It's like your average run of the mill ale, but just a bit more fruity and a light hop flavor towards the end. The carbonation is mild, not smooth like nitro brews, but relatively soft. Overall I could drink em all day and not be sick of the taste, but it would be my first choice if I was looking to only drink a beer or two after dinner. That being said if I see them in the custom six pack fridge I would be okay with adding one of these.",3.6
#9,"A definite rich color and apricot/fruit smell. It claims it's not quite an ale, and it feels like it needs a bit more in the hoppy department to even out the fruit flavor. With all that said, if on a hot day you need something not hoppy and not a lager, this works quite well as an evening drink after a day in the yard.",4.06
RuinTen Triple IPA,"Poured into a goblet: color is amber, transparent, head is off white and presents 1 finger thick, dissipates to a solid top, some lacing and streaking on the glass sides.

Smell is big, bitter, slightly biting - notes of pine, earth, citrus, juniper, some honey and syrupy notes, light caramel.

Taste is similar with big, bitter notes of hops and alcohol - pine, earth, citrus, honey, syrup, light toast and caramel, some tonicy/herbaly/juniper notes.

Mouthfeel is moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, strong bitterness and slight boozy burn.

Overall - amazed that big, big non-hazy IPAs are this hard to find - so much more nuance, flavor, and drinkability.",4.3

RuinTen Triple IPA,"(12 oz can, EJBY 08/13/22; purchased cold single at Shangy's last week... poured into a fat tulip)

L: clear, tawny-colored liquid with perhaps a faint hop haze; cratery, exploded foam sponge upon pour, collapsing quick into a thick, gummy collar... two droopy eyebrows of lace

S: semi-characteristically Stone melange of piney, outdoorsy, juice nectary hops along with a cane-sugar syrupy malty underbelly and moderately strident, tonic ethanol kick... upon further sniffage, an herbal cannabis overtone all day... supreme vibrancy if a bit indistinct in its aroma indentifiers

T: bitter-herbal, pungent hops blasting the palate roof while a jammy, citrusy hop and malt nectar permeates the palate floor with its airy, booze-shocked essences... the aftertaste is leavings of fruit and sugar sweetness with the peppery charge of biting bitterness still attacking the top, even cutting through to the sinuses... it's almost like a Malort and Cointreau-infused strong amber ale

F: resinous, silken, near cordial glory, lithe and luxurious yet punishingly pungent... its glassy, ghostly undercurrent is perhaps (along with its hot sauce fire) its most striking characteristic, as it seems to just float in the ether

O: for all it's brashness, quintessentially Stone in its relentless (to me, fantastic) bitterness, it sports jagged facets of two-dimensional, static, obscure, muddy expressions... I'm somewhat enjoying this, but craving something more characterful, though its tactile sensations are leaving me perplexed and intrigued (1970)",4.33
RuinTen Triple IPA,"Deep gold with decent head. It smells like alcohol and piney hops. Taste is bitter, a little hot, some malt , herbal, piney, with some fruit flavor poking through. Pretty strong and a little rough around the edges but not unbalanced and fairly easy to drink despite its profile. It reminds me of the original Hoptimum a little. Not a bad strong ale but I’ll file this in the been there done that and move on to other things, cheers!",3.85
RuinTen Triple IPA,"Disappointingly long lasting bitter after taste with no sweetness at all - unusual for double digit ABV.

RuinTen Triple IPA,"Canned April 15th enjoy by August 13th 2022.

Pours a clear gold, not much to talk aboot in the foam department.

Smells extremely hoppy but with a big malty bite. Citrus, some pine, leans into some tropical fruit but not hugely.

Huge Citrus bitterness and the malty sweetness is almost as huge, call it in balance, I reckon. Alcohol is there in spades but it is not hard to deal with.
A little bit spicy, earthy, vegetal, short sips are best for me.

Sticky, somewhat juicy mouthfeel.

Kind of wearing on the palate but I enjoy it.",3.76
RuinTen Triple IPA,"So cool they decided to brew this beer again.

Look: Old gold body, nice off-white head.

Smell: Pine, floral notes, orange peel,

Taste: Intense grapefruit hops--almost abrasive (in a good way!). Some sweet toffee malts mid-palate, fresh squeezed orange juice too. Clean, citrus-lemon finish with slightest white pepper alcohol note/burn. Wow.

Feel: Very big beer fuller medium to full bodied IPA.

Overall: This beer would be awesome to pair with food. Doesn't make sense to have more than one of these IMO, but this is an awesome West Coast IPA. The kind of IPA that got me into craft beer in the first place--very nostalgic and fun to try. And a pretty reasonable price point to boot. If I can find another fresh batch I'm definitely trying this again.",4.31

RuinTen Triple IPA,"I dont think i ever had the original.

Look is awesome. Deep amber with great clarity. Whats amazing is rhe syrupy thickness and the way the bubbles slowly rise from the bottom of the glass and just dont stop. I dont think ive ever poured a beer that has this much energy.

Smell is kind of mute.

Taste makes me think I have had this before. Its eerily familiar. Very bitter but not stale or difficult to drink.

Smells strongly of pine and resin with a nice tropical fruit background (pineapple?).

Very bitter, piney taste. Nice alcohol warmth. Slight malt sweetness.

The taste is bittersweet caramel malt with resinous citrus and pine sap before the earthy fully bitter finish.

Full hoppy, piney aroma.

On tasting, a haymaker to the tastebuds. Full on strong piney resinous bitterness lasts way beyond the finish. Hints of grapefruit. The malt base is strong, allowing a sweetness to lay under the bitterness without being trampled to death. Abv definitely felt, quite warming in the throat.

Mouth close to full, finish a sweetness and then that building, lasting bitterness.

Overall, excellent big dipa, tipa, whatever you want to call it. Had this as a sample at a Knoxville brewfest some years ago, and was hoping it would return. Appreciate the 12oz can size as well.",4.42

RuinTen Triple IPA,"Had this one on tap, after the Stone Enjoy By 31-10-15, at Ernie´s Tin Bar, Petaluma - and I was about ready for anything. Powerfully and aggressively hopped throughout, but still kind of balanced by the rich and fairly sweet malty base. Good stuff - when you´re ready for it.",4.0
RuinTen Triple IPA,"Tremendous nose of pine and citrus that is impossible to ignore. Taste is citrus hops with a slightly sweet malt body and lingering hop presence on the back end. Medium carbonation and medium-high body with some creaminess.
The ABV works with the beer and the way the brewer handled the hop load, ABV, and finish is fantastic. A truly drinkable triple IPA.",4.09

Goose IPA,"16 ounce draught pull in a chilled mug at Shrimp Shack in Ft. Myers, FL.
Arrived filled to the tip top, zero head, unremarkable smell, tastes common, maybe sub-common.
Feels like a thin food rinse, which worked out fine in pushing a shrimp po’ boy down.
Overall, a solid “meh”.",3.39
Goose IPA,Straw colored with a moderate head that settles nicely. Aroma is floral with a bit of citrus. Taste is reasonably typical IPA with a good amount of grapefruit with some breadiness and a moderate finish. A solid but not remarkable IPA.,3.53
Goose IPA,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a thin layer and leaves a little nice lacing.

S: Grassy, resinous, floral, a little citrus, earthy herbal notes, biscuity bready malt, and a pretty dry finish.

T: Citrus, lemon and grapefruit, floral, resinous pine, subtle fruity notes, apricot and peach, grassy earthy notes, biscuity bready malt, and a dry finish.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: The first few sips feel more like a lightened up classic American IPA with all the pithy citrus presence, but as it warms up the English side really comes out. Nothing overly exciting, but credit where it's due, it's actually pretty nicely balanced and rather drinkable. Probably never gonna be my first choice, but there are worse options to have around.",3.84
Goose IPA,"L- Good tall light tan head and transparent light copper beer.
S - Bitter grapefruit pith, some resin notes
T- Strongly bitter with grapefruit pith and pine resin notes. Little bit of floral sweetness and light malt do not help tamp down the bitterness for me.
M- Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation and drying bitters.
O- Strong hop bitterness put this out of my favorite zone.",3.44
Goose IPA,"Poured from a 12oz can
Unsure if this is the right place to review as this is just called IPA not Goose IPA but maybe it's just newer AB branding.

On the pour it's a pretty good looking beer with a decent sized rocky head and some nice lacing. Crystal clear straw color with no haze.

Smell is carrying some grapefruit and tropical notes with a fruity sweetness. I cant pick much else up with this sickness, my nose isnt quite functioning.

The taste is bold with bittering hops right in your face and a nice trickle of fruity flavors following behind it. Maybe a tad bit of malt backing it up, but nothing crazy, just firm pale malts standing in the back.

The feel on the other hand suggests more malts than I'm tasting the head comes back to life as you drink especially in large amounts slowing you down. But it does feel relatively seasonable other than that not too heavy on the stomach.

Overall a standard every day ipa for those that love ipas it isnt shy about the hops and the malts are firm enough to keep it steady. No off flavors and seems good enough quality wise. Not a huge IPA guy myself.",3.48

A- pours a clear golden yellow with a one finger head that has shirt retention

S- floral and earthy hops with undertones of biscuit, caramel and honey

T- floral hop bitterness up front is countered by some caramel maltiness. Mid-palate brings out some biscuit and a hint of citrus. The finish falls off, leaving only a hint of floral and citrus hop bitterness

M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that turns slightly creamy into the finish",3.48
Goose IPA,"Poured from a bottle, ""Drink by 10 Oct 21"", but I got it from a neighbor who was not storing it cool and not sure how long...
Anyways, it's a classic. I haven't had this in years so won't debate how it holds up against its former 'independent' self, and I don't care. It's a fine IPA, clear amber-yellow and classically bitter and malt-balanced, straight up citrus/pine hops and a dry hoppy finish.

I wouldn't have picked it up in a store, but happy to drink these from a friend.",3.75
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Had on tap at the Pour House on Market in Denver in a Sam Adam's ""curvy glass"".

On arrival a one finger fine head that dissipated to a decent covering pretty quickly. Body is a hazy golden yellow with fine but active carbonation. No lacing on this one.

Aroma is intensely lemony with a nice hit of wheat on the back.nowhere near a hefeweizen, but this is an ""American wheat beer"" so it's pretty good. Clean lemony wheat ale.

Taste follows the aroma but it is quite balanced and all the lemon flavor tastes gery natural like lemon juice. Behind that is a solid wheat malty backbone with just a hind of bitterness on the very back. The bitterness could be lemon zest or hops it's hard to tell but maybe they are working together.

The feel has an intense carbonation bite that is quickly followed by a soft and pleasant head. This is a pretty dry beer in terms of mouth feel, but the finish is medium long and quite smooth.

Overall this is a surprisingly nice wheat beer with lemon additions. The grains of paradise aren't particularly noticable but I have a hard time picking up coriander in belgian brews so maybe this is similar. Overall this is a nice summery lemony wheat beer that is nicely balanced in the malt to lemon rind, but hops are hard to specifically pick up.",3.86
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Pretty light copper color, a flat wheat taste with barely a hint of citrus. Bland wheat and grass aroma without a distinct citrus scent. Not my favorite from Samuel Adams, but it is a good enough beer.",3.81

Look: Slightly hazy yellow-gold pouring a 1.5 finger head which dissipated into a thin cap

Taste: Lime zest, lemon zest and wheat. Small amount of hops lingers in there. Tiny pinch of baking spice. Little to no perceivable bitterness.
Feel: Moderate carbonation and light body. Crisp and refreshing.
Overall: This is the beer that got me onto wheat beers and remains as one of my favorite beers. Really refreshing beer for hot days.",4.1
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"I had high hopes, but the beer is at best lack luster. I'm a home brewer and I recently tried, and liked, Blue Moon Belgian White. I made up a recipe to brew a wheat beer, inspired by Blue Moon Belgian White. So, I thought I would try other brands to see if they were less, equal, or better than the Blue Moon. The Samuel Adams beer is just OK, not close to being equal to the Blue Moon. As I type this, I am drinking a single 12 oz bottle of Shock Top Belgian White (bought to do side by side with Samuel Adams Summer Ale) and it could be a kissin' cousin to Samuel Adams Summer Ale. I do not think I could tell them apart in a blind test. I will not be buying either of these again, and will go with the light, tasty, and very refreshing Blue Moon Belgian White. Both of these beers command a premium as compared to Bud, Coors, Tecate, etc, but they don't deliver on the taste, so, why bother and pay more? They all are, after all, just beer, and are very drinkable. My first impression, when I drank the Samuel Adams Summer Ale was, ""I'm glad I only bought the six pack of bottles and not paid twice as much for the 12 pack!""",2.28

Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Slight lemon zest smell mixed with some light malt. You can taste the typical wheat beer flavor on the front but then there is this strange lemony, sour, citrus finish. I make it sound bad- it’s not bad. It’s actually very refreshing on a hot day like it was today. The grains of paradise make a decent showing in this beer and add a nice depth to it overall. I will probably be buying some more before the season ends. At 5.3% ABV, it’s easy to enjoy a few of these while grilling or sitting outside with friends. It’s not my usual choice of beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. Try a 6-pack if you haven’t already.",3.59
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"This is an interesting citrus wheat beer. It's got more fruit flavor than something like a Blue Moon, but there's something odd about the smell. I think I just don't like beers that smell too fruity. Taste is better than the smell, but I'd like at least a little bit of bitterness and hop flavor. I also taste something slightly spicy, but I'm not sure what it is. Overall, just an average beer.",3.26
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Even with low expectations this still disappoints. Does not resemble any other wheat beer I've had, and other large-ditro one's get it done much better. Sam's just consistently brews below-avg beer.",3.06
Samuel Adams Summer Ale,"Look...Pale brown with some haze
Smell...citrus wheat hint of honey, hops
Taste...juice bitter explosion into a pilsener not too bitter drying finish. A beer i wish i woulda found earlier in the year.

Overall... I am always reticent to try new beers from the Boston Beer Company as I have not bought one in 20 years? Yikes it probably has been that long!!! And this beer was given to by a friend so i will maybe have to take off the 20 year hiatus off the Sam Adams, Anyway this beer is very nice example of heff pilsener mix.",3.88

What seperates this wheat beer from all others in the pack is the quality of the ingredients. It feels and tastes like someone cares.",4.0
White,"Bottle from Whole Foods.

A mildly hazy light yellow with a dense, white head with excellent retention and lacing. The nose is rich and delicate with a blend of soft grain, light spice with soft clove and a really lovely, delicate citrus note. Delicate yeast notes and soft earth. The palate opens clean and spicy, lightly grainy and with a beautiful citrus note, clean and earthy. Delicate dough on the mid-palate, light wheat, drying on the finish. Crisply carbonated, lovely texture. Brilliant.",4.28
White,"I am not a fan of white beers or wit biers in general so this is a biased review from start. Had it on tap at high-end steakhouse. Good, solid pour with appreciable head. Unfortunately, tasted like other white beers and added nothing new. My opinion on these have not changed",2.19
White,"Procured in a trade with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022. Drunk in July 2022.

Pours a very pale, almost watery yellow. It has a thin foam rim around the edges and leaves lacing on the glass.

The nose is yeasty, vinous and spicy, with coriander peeking out between the layers. It's what I consider a classic witbier smells like.

Taste closely follows aroma. There's more clove on the palate than picked up in the nose, and the spices really pop once the beer is on the tongue. The finish is quite dry, which immediately makes me want a second sip.

In the mouth, there's a significant carbonic prickle, and it follows the beer down with the swallow. The beer is not particularly high in alcohol but it leaves a warmth in the stomach.

Overall, this is a very tasty beer and could be drunk in significant quantities if desired, especially on a hot day.

Cheers!",3.84

Maximus,"A solid double IPA. More resinous than citrus with a heat that builds up as you continue drinking. Plentiful pine notes with the resin. There is some citrus, but this is definitely a resin type of DIPA. Dry finish with plenty of bitterness. There's some malt character here but it is easily overshadowed by the hops. It feels a bit on the heavier end of IPAs and does tend to stick around. As I continue to sip on it, notes of pineapple, savory notes, and even candied dried fruit.",4.13
Maximus,"Love the hoppy smell when the bottle is opened. Tastes great and you really don't notice the higher ABV, especially on a warm summer day. Very drinkable anytime but iced cold is the best.

Look - Pours a dense off-white head that leaves lacing. Crystal clear, golden amber appearance with a small amount of streaming bubbles.
Smell - The scent is very floral. Also picking up a lot of citrus like orange juice, and some berry scents.
Taste - The taste follows the nose with the floral and citrus flavors blending together and creating a pleasant taste. Bitterness is very minimal, and alcohol taste is non-existent.
Feel - Medium bodied mouthfeel and finishes with almost no dryness.
Overall - A dangerously drinkable brew that has great citrus and floral flavors, and you know it.",4.3
Maximus,I got a 6pck of bottles of this beer from my local meijer store. It poured a clear copper with thin white head that is leaving some lace. The scent had bitter citrus and pine hop notes.

Maximus,"12oz Lagunitas bottle served in a pint glass. Beer is brilliant golden in color, with great clarity, and a nice fat orange-tinged head. Aroma doesn't have me jumping up and down, but there's big alpha hop flavor, complemented with a very slightly syrupy golden caramelized malt body. An oldschool IIPA that doesn't go overboard on alpha. The result is bitter but still quite drinkable.

Taste is sweet malt base followed by bitter grapefruit peel hops; orange peel middle; very little pine with some earthy hop dullness on backend. Medium light body, moderate minus carbonation; no warmth from 9% abv; no astringency; smooth malty/sticky feel.

Smells wonderful, like grapefruit, lemon, malt and a nice vegetal essence. The taste is definitely balanced, in an impressive way with sweet malt as a backbone and sharp citrus notes with bitter hops all dancing in harmony. Slightly quick and clean finish. Each sip makes me want more, but at 9.0% abv this one is dangerous.",4.25
Maximus,"This has a nice semi dark amber color to it, perfectly clear and very effervescent. The head is thick, about two and half fingers and very bubbly and long lasting.
Nice citrus smells, lemon rind and grapefruit rind mixed in with a mild wheat grass and pine aromas and a bit of a pungent smell follows that.
Smooth and very tasty, the grapefruit flavor hits you first, followed by a semi sweet pine and spicy/herbal mix, very earthy. It leaves a nice bitter aftertaste in your mouth.
The body feels a bit light for the style, but that being said, the flavor is right on and more than makes up for the feel, overall this is a fun beer to drink.",4.17

Maharaja,This is an amazing beer. I have no idea why the named it after the official beer from India. The Indian made beer is like a nice coors lite. This is a man's beer. Fruity mango. Nice balance between 10% and sweet n bitter. Love it. Get it if you can,4.89
Maharaja,"Ok this one is pretty. It's a orangeish copper barely translucent with a white head that settles into a nice cap and leaves lacing all over the walls of the glass. It smells very sweet with caramel bites and a touch of piney mangoes, but it's not as fragrant as expected. The alcohol is present on this one. The gates is sweet and warming up front followed by a nice tropical fruit flavor that compliments the alcoholic sweetness nicely. This one goes down too smoothly for a double digit abv beer.

I was surprised by the smell— sweet for an imperial, with mango and pineapple immediately, along with a twinge of dank hops. The taste is big and complex. Sweet at first, with the mango and pineapple, becoming floral pine and bready malt, finishing moderately dank and bitter. The 10% is apparent after a few sips. Feel is wonderfully creamy, soft, and wet, which seems to balance the big flavor and ABV.

Maharaja,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a nice foamy light tan head of 1F sits on a golden orange tinged beer with about 80% transparency.

The nose is floral, bready, light grapefruit and pine.

I taste lightly sweet malt with grapefruit and alcohol with pithy hop dryness. I also get some pine and a bit of sulfur and a hint of thymol (Listerine note). This is not nearly as dark and dank as Avery describes. It is not too bitter but rather presents too much of a sharp alcohol character.

Mouthfeel is slick and medium bodied with drying astringency and alcohol. Very light carbonation and a hint of metallic tang.

I am glad I got to try this beer. The beer did not taste super hoppy unless it is those ""off"" notes of thymol and pine resin mixed with alcohol that is just not doing it for me.

Orval Trappist Ale,"I have had this beer many times and much enjoy it. I can’t believe I never actually reviewed it. So here it goes
Poured from a can into tulip glass
Appearance – The beer pours a hazed deep amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has amazing retention, slowly fading over time and leaving a ton of foamy and streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is strong of a biscuit malt mixed with lots of coriander and some clove. Along with these aromas comes notes of yeast and apricot as well as a touch of pepper and hay.
Taste – The taste begins with a nice crisp cracker and biscuit malt flavor mixed with a nice blend of spice of coriander, clove, and white pepper. Other flavors of yeast and herb are there as well, blending nicely with the malt and spice. There is a bit of sweetness mixed within as well, with notes of apricot, peach, and white grape. The taste remains similar in nature throughout, maintaining a smooth and balanced flavor. A touch of hay joins in at the end, leaving one with a flavorful, but nice crisp and clean taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel- The body is very light and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. Fantastic for the style and taste and very easy drinking.
Overall – A great Belgian pale ale. Super flavorful and amazingly easy to drink. Fantastic.",4.25
Orval Trappist Ale,"L - Poured as directed by Orval leaving one centimeter in the bottle. Beautiful caramel-orange color with a three finger creamy head and aggressive carbonation. Head retention is the most I have seen on a beer. High lacing throughout the session.

S - I was surprised at the faintness of the nose. Some spice, citrus pith and malt. But, towards the end of the session, the spice and malt stepped up with a hint of bread. I then realized the beer was too cold.

T - Citrus peel, malt and hop bitterness, which is more pronounced than expected and nicely lingers on the finish. The hop bitterness is interesting because it is so balanced. Unlike other Belgian styles, this ale is only slightly sweet.

F - Medium-full bodied with high carbonation that becomes more tame. Medium dry finish. ABV is not overwhelming but you begin to feel it towards the end of your glass.

O - This is a strange beer for me. My first Belgian anything that was not sweet. Oh, and the bitterness through me for a loop. However, the bitterness was very nice and as the beer warmed, the aroma and flavor increased in layers. Definitely will have this again.",4.2
Orval Trappist Ale,"I’m reminded of valet Chris Rock agape at Eddie Murphy’s dump truck in BHC2: I get $20 for a car, $50 for a limo, WTF is that???

Some fruit notes on the nose, and the abv is apparent.

On tasting, strong and full flavored. Quite bitter, some light fruit wafts in and out. Abv seems higher than the 6.9 listed. A little sweetness here and there.

Mouth very full. Finish bitter and a little drying.

Overall, enjoyable drink once the palate adjusts to the bitterness level and can enjoy the nuances. Wouldn't say no to another.",4.17
Orval Trappist Ale,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, deep amber color with a massive off-white head that lingers like root beer float. (4.50)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of citrus upfront. Followed by grapefruit, juicyfruit, bubblegum, and bread spice esters. (4.00)

Flavor: Strong and funky flavors here. There's grapefruit and tart pear fruit. Then a strong funky yeast in the middle. A semi-sweet pale malt finish. The funk lingers. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. A full mouthfeel with a lingering funk. (3.75)

Compared to Saison Dupont 5/21/22: Pours a darker color, larger head. Stronger aromas. More funky yeast. Less juicyfruit and bread spice. A larger body, and sweeter.

Overall: A lot more barnyard funk on this one that I had expected. Almost overpowering. Granted, this one is about 3-5 years in age. Maybe more than usual wild yeast formed. Hard to get a whole lot of other flavors here because the funk and tart fruit overpower a bit. Not sure if this is normal for this one. I think this one may have been spoiled. Maybe I'll have to try it fresh sometime. (Rating: 3.86)",3.86
Orval Trappist Ale,"L - Poured from a bottle into a Dogfish Head Signature Glass at around 55 - 60 degrees. (Bottled on 08/07/2021, poured on 05/10/2022.) Humongous off-white/bone white head on a not very aggressive pour. Head does not dissipate quickly. It’s frothy and foamy to no end. Lacing stays for the whole drink. It’s a light copper clear color. Incredibly appealing look.

S - Deep malt characteristics up front. Warm baked bread. A little yeast sweetness as well.

T - Taste is lighter than scent. More of a cracker or biscuit malt, with some sourness paired with sweetness. Light fruits come through as well. Maybe a citrus zest. Some earthy tones appear in there. Finish has some mild bitterness and pepperiness. The hoppy bitterness and pepper is more present as it warms up. These dry bitter flavors really overpower the second half of the drink.

F - Medium-to-heavy carbonation, but medium-to-light mouthfeel. Surprisingly dry finish. Almost like a brut champaign. The more I drink it, there’s a lot of dry aftertaste. Which is not appealing.

O - Overall, I love the complexity and mixture of this beer at the start. It begins as a great blend of malts, yeast, and light hops, with none of them overpowering the other. Each taste brings something a little different. Then, as you drink, the bitterness, dryness, and pepper starts to overpower. So much so, that my appreciation diminished by the end. I didn’t even want to take the last two gulps to finish it. Unfortunately, I will not add it to my rotation, and would not recommend in favor of other offerings.",3.32
Orval Trappist Ale,"Bottled Dec 21, 2021. Pours a hazy penny-copper colour with two fingers of thick, white head. It slowly collapses, sticking around a decent amount, into a millimetre (or two) thick dense foam cap.

Spicy and doughy aromas typical of Belgian yeast swirl with a little bit of floral, spicy hop notes. Caramel malt is present in good amount. Slight funky earthy spin, with good leanings towards some lightly musty but fruity affect — grape, apple, and citrus.

Feels like I’ve been waiting my whole life to try a beer like this, fusing my love of crisp pale ales and doughy Belgian ales. Spicy and fruity up front, biscuity and doughy on the back end, medium-low presence of bittering hops throughout that are primarily earthy and floral in quality. The spicy, peppery phenolic character is quite nice, and a little nutty as well, a mix between almond slices and cloves, white peppercorn and coriander. Citrus zest and peel is noticeable on the back half of each sip, and adds both a fresh quality and adds to the bittering presence of the hops. A beer that lets each note rise before melding into the next one before melding into the next one, which gives this beer a remarkably balanced taste profile. Grassy, zesty, earthy, mildly funky. The funk is stronger on the nose than palate.

Light-medium bodied with higher carbonation, fairly effervescent. Long, doughy and yeasty finish that leaves impressions of bitter hop and lemon peel on the edges of your tongue and hints of phenolic spice. Finishes dry.

A Belgian Pale Ale… Finally! I love PAs, and I absolutely adore Trappist ales. Combining the two, amazing! When the LCBO finally got a new batch in I could have it for the first time! This is a very fresh batch that I need to grab about 5 so I can cellar them and come back to this review every couple of months. Great fusion of flavours. I can see this mellowing and evolving over the years, though I imagine there’s likely a Goldilocks zone before it gets too aged it mellows out the great yeasty phenols as well as the grassy, fresh hops that are present in higher amounts than almost any other Trappist ale and most Belgians in particular. Lovely ale",4.34
Orval Trappist Ale,"I've read the previous review by illtexzona , and agree that freshness has to do a bunch with quality. the Whole Foods in my neighborhood started carrying Belgian & Trappist things & most recently Orval. I bought 2 almost immediately- probably the freshest Orval Ive had, & it's a completely different animal than the ones at the other most reputable liquor store- totally worth the (recently inflated) price.",4.21
Orval Trappist Ale,"Bottled April 8/21.
Pours a clear orange amber colour with teaming fluffy off white head. a bit of haze as got some dregs at last of pour.
Fruity funky aroma - earthy hops, definite Brett effect - grape, lime, ripe apple - fruity esters, bubblegum and a touch of band aid.
Taste follows with a funky fruity sweetness, that somehow manages to be tart and a bit spicy; notes of lemon, bubblegum, and at the back an aggressive bitterness that mixes with an herbal sweet-tart flavour.
Exceptionally effervescent carbonation, boldly bittersweet and funky with a dry finish. Have had before and frankly enjoyed more - I feel I did not hit the sweet spot of age for me.",3.75
Orval Trappist Ale,"I'd call it a deep honey color liquid with marshmallow fluff filling the glass. It is a little hazy but you can still see thru it. The head stubbornly falls to a dollop, but is leaving huge residue on the glass.

The aroma is fruity banana esters, slightly sweet, a bit of bubble gum. White grape, some extremely mild funk, some earthy brett. A bready note supports all of the aromatics. Maybe a little lemony citrus to cut through the rest and liven it up some.

The taste is intriguing. Not at all what I expected from the nose. It is really soft. I get the esters and bubblegum notes first with a lovely malty sweetness, but with further sips the aromatic notes recede a bit and it lays even more more malty and spicy. It strikes me more like a wild ale, quite yeasty but with more than enough malt to tie everything together. If it is funky at all, it is very laid back. There is spiciness that seems like a bit of coriander and a hint of anise. It's fairly phenolic giving it a nice peppery sensation. Noticeable amount of bitterness on the finish, and there is a lemon note that lingers and helps reset the taste buds.

I'd call the body medium, lively carbonation, pretty dry. The bitterness, while evident, is pleasantly mellow.

It's unique - and somehow everything that is going on plays nicely in the sandbox to deliver a highly enjoyable drinking experience that I really can't put into words. This is certainly a case where the gestalt matters. It's fun, makes me happy.",4.27
Orval Trappist Ale,"Orval it’s a classic and Unique Trappist beer. With golden brown color, high carbonation, and amazing head retention! Aroma Wiest sweetness and Wood and a flavor of Slight malt yeast and have a woody bitterness that comes through. Cheers!",5.0
Orval Trappist Ale,"Served from the bottle in a Boulevard tall tulip.

Pours a partly hazy sunrise auburn topped by over a finger of bone foam. The nose comprises sharp hay, dry biscuit, grass, sweet flowers, and funky wheat. The taste brings in more of the same, a touch of mild clove and black pepper swirling around in there as well. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a Death Valley level of dryness in the finish. An enjoyable Trappist treat that gets even more interesting with more age on it (4 and 5 years seem to be damn solid right now).",3.83
Orval Trappist Ale,"Bottled 2/9/2021

L: Amber body with a massive frothy head

S: Barnyard, Belgian yeast, earthy, hay, vinegar, slight bubblegum and clove

T: Medium bitterness, barnyard funk, bready, spice

F: High carbonation, medium bodied, clean and slightly dry finish

O: Unique and complex drinking experience",4.08
Orval Trappist Ale,"Bottle bought in 2016, finally opened 1/3/2022.

A - Pours copper orange, mostly transparent but some haze with the yeast, short white head, persistent cap, some lacing but not much.

S - Brett up front, bandaids and acidity, apple and white wine, grape highlights. As it warms, the Brett recedes and a powerful bubble gum sweetness comes forward.

T - Follows the nose, but with the acidity, fruit and a touch of bitter pith front, and the Brett coming in beneath. The plastic and barnyard notes are there but they work as a part of the whole.

M - Bright brisk carbonation, light weight, slick feel, clean finish.

O - A rock solid drinking experience, 5+ years in the making. Quite happy I opened this one up.",4.28
Orval Trappist Ale,"Bottle dated 8/7/21, drank 1/1/22

This is the probably the freshest Orval I've ever drank. I'd compare it to drinking a young lambic, and how it mellows out and flavors change over time. Young Orval pours with a ton white foam in the middle and whispy head around the edges. Tons effervescent carbonation and grassy hops. The belgian yeast hasn't had a lot of time to take over yet. I've had this beer several times and now I want to do some side by sides with aging after having this fresh one.",4.18
Orval Trappist Ale,This is probably the best beer on the planet. No two Orvals taste the same; every bottle offers a unique experience. You can drink it fresh or aged. I am currently imbibing an Orval bottled in April of 2020 and it is out of this world. These Brewers from Brasserie d'Orval only need this single offering and its humble labeling to show what true Masters they are.,4.8
Orval Trappist Ale,This was stupid carbonated to me but I was forced to drink it out of the bottle at the time. That said it heavily reminded me of champagne and I look forward to putting this in a glass next time,4.03
Orval Trappist Ale,"Pour is highly effervescent with a lot of white foam. Smells like raisin and is very smooth heft on the palate. Tastes phenolic with slight brown sour dough bread with slight hops. The 6.9 ABV is hidden well. Overall, complex & smooth; I like it!",4.15
Orval Trappist Ale,"Appearance: Cloudy, muddy copper. Pours to a massive frothy off white head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Lots of funky, yeasty aromas.

Flavor: Moderate bitterness. Spicy & earthy.

Mouth-Feel: Light to medium bodied, a little creamy. Pours highly effervescent, but releases the carbonation nicely. Drying, moderate length finish with a mild trailing bitterness.

Overall: This would be consider a ""young"" beer. Bottled in May 2021, drank in November. It still has the yeasty, hoppy character that mellows with age. Curious how this will taste about a year or two down the road. Pours super carbonated, producing a huge, fluffy off-white head, but seems to release the carbonation better than other Belgians. Makes it a little more drinkable. Very nice.",4.56
Yeti,"The 9.5% ABV was too high. Don't get me wrong, I love a great buzz as much as the next guy. But my taste buds mostly registered the alcohol flavor which overwhelmed the other flavors in the beer.",3.15
Yeti,"Here’s another one I’m surprised I haven’t reviewed before.

Pours a luscious liquid black, like delicious motor oil. Creamy cocoa cap of foam.
Cocoa and coffee roasty notes come up front on the nose. The sip has a prominent hoppiness that gives it a sharp roast character. Long lingering finish. Opens as it warms. Always reliable. Always delicious.",4.73
Yeti,"Looks dark black, jet black, frothy head that lingers, some very nice lacing. It's a little cool still so there's a bit of haze on the glass. Smells of dark chocolate, toasted malt, licorice, syrup/molasses, maybe some BBQ bark.

Taste follows. Very chewy, thick beer. Not overly sweet, finishes dry and bitter. Actually reminiscent of Storm King. Maybe it's cascade? Anyway, nice easy drinking, bitter option. Good beer. Easily worth the price of admission.",4.24
Yeti,"Poured into a pint glass at about 50 degrees. Black as used motor oil with a khaki 2.5 finger head that reduces down to a nice thick film that lasts. Epic lacing from the top down. Absolutely no light coming through this beer. Smell is heavily roasted coffee and baker's cocoa, with a very slight hoppy funk hidden underneath the malt character. Taste blows me away with rich cocoa and straight coffee with very little sweetness aside from an initial and very short-lived toffee kick, and the hops really add a nice floral punch that ends in a long-lasting bitter hanging on the palette. Mouthfeel is medium-thick and fairly heavy, but velvety smooth and the CO2 level is somewhat light, which makes it filling, but not bloating. Alcohol is hidden nicely under all the bitter malt and hop character making this a very nice sipper that really hits the imperial stout bullseye.",4.94
Yeti,"Look: Jet black pour from a 12oz can into a 20 oz cup. A bit of foam risen to the surface. Not much lacing as it goes down.
Smell: The aroma resembles a heavy caramel toasty stout with slight chocolate after hints.
Taste: Heavy roasted chocolate for the initial sip followed by aromas of caramel aftertaste.
Feel: medium to heavy bodied for this one, doesn’t taste like a 9%. It resembles a 6-7% for me. Not to shabby.
Overall: Not bad! I’ve been meaning to try this beer for a while but haven’t had the chance to get it. It’s a once in a lifetime experience so if you can get you’re hand on it I say go for it to at least try. This wasn’t the pick of the crop for me but it doesn’t mean it isn’t for anyone else.",4.25
Yeti,"Very nice lacey head. Smell is sweet— caramel malt, coffee, and a hint of citrus. Taste follows- a pronounced pine hoppiness upfront becomes leather, roasted malt, caramel, and salt, finishing with coffee and chocolate notes. Moderate to high carbonation, and quite masked alcohol. A very nicely balanced, not overly sweet stout. Can’t ask for more than that.",4.13
Yeti,"Stunning pour. Huge thick lacey brown rich head, that just stayed there.

Slight hoppiness on the nose, and in the taste. Not really enough maltiness to break through, but still very enjoyable overall.

A very solid, well priced beer.

This is my number 1 inexpensive beer. Serious beer, and the price just makes it special.",4.31
Yeti,"Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of dark chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes of black coffee, caramel and vanilla. Smooth but bitter at the finish.",4.15
Yeti,"Look: Wo bud. Black with straight up tan sea foam everywhere. Lacing is mesmerizing.

Smell: Hoppy, roasted and sour.

Taste: Ink in beer form. Bitter, dark chocolate, coffee, grass, hint of aspirin. No remorse.

Feel: Medium to full bodied. Carbonation is barely there.

Overall: One of my favorite stouts. Thank you, Great Divide.",4.84
Yeti,From a can dated 5/5/21. Jet black with a quarter inch of dark brown head. Roasted malt smell. Heavier body but very smooth feel. Roasted malts and coffee flavors with a lasting bitter finish. This is great!,4.32
Yeti,"12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Canned on 2/3/21.

L---Darkest, impenetrable brown color. Massive light brown head had great retention and left phenomenal lacing.

S---Roasted malts. Coffee, caramel.

T---Follows the nose perfectly, but a little bit stronger..

F---Feels big, although the high ABV is hidden. Well carbonated. A sipper, not a gulper.

O---Just excellent.",4.24
Yeti,"Poured pitch black with a two finger choco malt milkshake head that dissipated slowly leaving heavy lacing. Absolutely beautiful! Nose of roasted malt, molasses, toffee and coffee. Taste follows the nose but is very robust with layering of flavors followed by black licorice, leather and pronounced hop bitterness that lingers for a long finish. Moderate - heavy body and medium carbonation. Dry finish. This is a real sipper with its fullness, pronounced flavor layering and higher ABV that is hidden. I would have scored this higher but the bitterness seems to overwhelm the brew, which I do not believe is characteristic of a well balanced RIS.",4.07
Yeti,"Bottle, kindly shared by gunnar. ABV 9.5%. Pitch black colour, brown head. Lovely aroma of heavily roasted malts, cigar box and leather. Intense roasty flavour with notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and English liquorice. Brilliant stuff!",4.5
Yeti,"I mean this is solid, since it's imperial I wouldn't recommend if you're not into the higher alcohol realm. This tastes like 5% when it's really 9.5%. Easy drinking im not gonna say I had my mind blown but def real solid.


After trying this more and on tap I still really would keep coming back to it. This is just consistent",4.5
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"330ml bottle into a pint glass. Best by 5/26/23, so plenty fresh.

Looks nice in the glass. A glassy pale yellow body with a small white head, shrinking to a ring and covering.

Strong banana, wheat, yeasty aroma.

On tasting, confirms the nose. It's very strong, maybe a little too strong.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish wheat, yeast, and a faint bitter note.

Overall, pretty decent witbier, maybe a bit too strong to be considered refreshing, but a nice enough drink.",3.83
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"As summer comes to an unofficial close this weekend, this is a good time to remember a nice summer time brew. We picked up a pack of Hoegaarden a few weeks ago and enjoyed them in rapid succession on a nice rooftop night. This beer is Allagash and Blue Moon with some balls. Great spice to these suds with lovely orange notes and a real spice kick. Both RC and myself had never had it before and I'm sure it will be revisited soon.",3.84
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"One of my top beers. It is amazing that something bursting with so much flavor is so inexpensive relatively.

Strong wheat flavors, mixed with something herbal or botanical. Very easy to drink quickly - once I start drinking a bottle it is so delicious and smooth that it does not last long. Cloudy appearance with bits of yeast swirling around.",4.73
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"11.2oz bottle freshest before 28/02/2023 poured into a tulip glass at fridge temp 4.9% ABV. The beer pours hazy soft yellow in color with nearly white head. The head recedes to a thin cap. The aroma is mild with coriander, wheat malt and vague citrus peel. The taste is all of that with a nice injection of clove / bubblegum yeast flavor. Minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is soft, medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, good.",3.74
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"Awesome, summer beer perfect sweet and sour flavor from malt and orange and coriander super balanced and refreshing every time for a Belgian wit ale",5.0
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"Look: Clear yellow with 2 fingers of head
Smell: Notes of wheat and lemon
Taste: Crisp and clean. Wheat and citrus notes are detected.

Overall: This is a very refreshing beer on a warm summer day. Definitely one of the best products that I have tried from Anheuser-Busch.",4.0
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"Enjoyed this around the firepit recently for the first time in at least a decade. My first real go-to Wit. Love it nostalgically, and still delivers great flavors, especially at such low abv",4.09
Hoegaarden Original White Ale,"Excellent taste for a large brewery and a wildly distributed product.
Great citrus and spice notes. Far better than most mass produced offerings.
Best served cold with some food.",4.16
Coors Light,"Obviously, it's Coors light. There is a mix of light bread and banana scents with a much cleaner finish than the competitor light beers. I usually keep this around for the end of the night when I don't want much more alcohol/calories but want another round. It also has a place in a large cooler for a summer event. Not a bad product for what it is.",2.76
Coors Light,"Bought at a supermarket in Algorta (Spain). 330 ml. bottle poured into a Pilsener glass.

-No foam head. Lots of bubbles.
-Herbal smell.
-Pilsener taste but very bodied.
-Almost no after taste.

Very dull beer.",1.79
Coors Light,"Had an original Coors beer recently and it brought back memories from the 60s for me. Got one of these to see if it did the same. It did. Not close to what I really remember though. Anyway, if you're looking for something light, this one will work.",2.23
Coors Light,"Poured from a 12oz can best by September 12th 2022 into a pils glass

On the pour I was pleasantly surprised by a nearly 4 finger head from a slightly hard pour. The dissipation is still fast enough that it goes down to a covering over top in a minute, but still I expected worse. Very very lively carbonation with a very pale straw body, barely darker than a champagne.

Aroma is bad. Watered down, and what is there is all awful terribly treated yeast. Has an old sweaty character to it with a certain metallic quality as well. No malts are detectable on the nose over all the offness. Straight failure barely has a beer smell it's just bad. Not disgusting like shit, but it's bad. I can see why it's called piss water.

Taste is thankfully not like the smell some malts are actually present, just a vague crackery malt with zero bitterness to balance. The malts come at the very end however and the rest of the beer gives a beer flavored seltzer vibe. Very watery even in flavor.

Feel is of carbonated water with much more carbonation bite than necessary. Slightly more body than actual soda water with some head forming on your sip but it's hard to get past the carbonation bite. Super easy to put down from the can though, for the same reason white claws are easy to put down, your body assumes it's just bubbles and water.

Overall you'd probably be better off drinking keystone light or even bud light. I prefer Banquet over Budweiser, but coors light is some authentic piss water.",1.9
Coors Light,"Pours a pale golden color with a huge, spongy head atop.

Aromas are defined by fresh cut hay, a spicy hop note and a rustic toffee sweetness.

This has quite a refreshing mouthfeel to it with a late, stony effervescence, highlighting the light body of the beer.

Tastes of hay, well water and a bubbly, mineralic carbonation, inviting a well working malt backbone to the palate. Has a subtle, yet sugary mid palate with nothing else to offer and finishes with a sprizzy, yet watery ending.

This manages to be light and refreshing, while unfolding a one dimensional flavor profile at the same time, making this perfect for when its effect is more important than the beer‘s actual taste.",2.78
Coors Light,"There are some instances when Coors Light tastes like the greatest thing in the world. When you need a light beer and you peer over at the tap handles and spot Bud. Then Miller. And then you scan a little further and see those mountains peering over the other handles it brings a feeling of relief over me. Of the big three light beers in the US, this is without any dispute, the best. Semi sweet, crisp, American piss water. How it should. I’m a sucker for a good Molson Canadian, this basically that in light form. We get it, light beer, piss, feh. There’s a time and a place for Coors light. It’s refreshing, it goes down like nothing and it doesn’t tastes like stale cat urine. That’s a win in my book. Love Train.",2.72
Coors Light,"I bought a silver bullet 473ml at 4%.
In Canada.
Poured beer into glass with 1 finger head but leaves a little bit of a lace as you drink it.
Very clear clean golden color good carbonation.
Overall an ok light Beer

Coors Light,"One of the first beers I've ever tasted many years ago. I described it as alcoholic water that's been soaked in bread.

Years later, I'd imagine not much has changed.",1.38
Coors Light,"So, I'm frequently prompted to drink this in a nearby neighbors' garage upon passing. I am frequently reminded that this is the very worst of all the macros, at least the popular ones. Surely there is worse beer possible, so I left room for those with my rating.",1.84
Coors Light,"It’s not a classy, sophisticated, craft beer. I know it. The color doesn’t give you warm fuzzies about it having taste. It smells like any macro in its class, nothing special. All that being said, I enjoy an ice-cold Coor’s Light. It’s light on the palate, refreshing, and not overbearing. You don’t drink it to impress or prove your knowledge of beer. You drink it because you’re a beer guy and it goes well with burgers or wings. It’s also nice to have while watching football or a movie.

It’s not going to overwhelm you with anything but you know what you’re getting. It’s wholesome, it’s decent, it’s affordable.",3.5
Coors Light,"I grabbed a can of Coors Light from somebody's refrigerator in California. I drank the can of Coors Light and wrote a review...

Look: Coors Light had abundant amounts of foam.
Smell: Coors Light had a chemical grainy adjunct beer aroma.
Taste: Coors Light had a vague flavour similar to carbonated water with hints of alcohol.
Feel: Coors Light had good amounts of fizzy bubbles.
Overall: Coors Light is a beer for people who will drink anything to quench their thirst.",3.0
Fresh Squeezed IPA,"16 oz draft pour. Pours a light amber/yellow color with an off-white head. Aroma and flavor feature juicy citrus, a medium and slightly sweet malt backbone, and moderate bitterness. It's easy to drink and I preferred it to the Surly Furious I drank before.",4.1
Fresh Squeezed IPA,"My go to for a lower abv and lower bitterness ipa.

The aroma is your typical IPA , citrus and pine, very noticeable.
Fruity upfront, sweet, then the hoppy, crisp, bitter finish.
The mouthfeel is medium, with the hops giving it a somewhat dry finish.
To me this is a very good IPA, sweet fruit, juicy, slightly bitter, but not over the top.",3.87
Fresh Squeezed IPA,"Look: Amber honey like color 1 finger sightly off-white head.

Smell: sweet aromas of citrus, mango, pine.

Taste: Sweet beginnings with mellow flavors of mango, lime, lemon, orange peel, grapefruit, pine and a dry, nice and bitter mouthfeel.

I little disappointed by the amount of hop presence.

IBU: 60 IBV: 6.4%",4.14

Fresh Squeezed IPA,"Very drinkable. I’m not a fan of IPAs that feel thick enough to bite. This one was smooth without being watery- good balance. Good flavor. Well done.

My first Deschutes brew. Will try more.",4.71
Fresh Squeezed IPA,Delicious and lots of hops. Pours with huge head (4 fingers) that leaves tons of lacing. Lots of hops aroma and flavor finishing into mango. Silky and almost creamy mouthfeel. Just a bit lacking on bitterness to throw off the balance. Very very good overall though.,4.3

Fresh Squeezed IPA,"12oz can, tulip, canned 10/5/21.

Red skewed amber with a crackly, generous papyrus colored head and even some nice lace.

Juicy grape, mango, and peach rings. Vibrant, and again, very juicy.

The peach rings and gummy candy come out strong. There’s a malt backbone with an English character, which is something I haven’t tasted in a hot minute. The bitterness is smooth, medium, and finishes cleanly.

A medium-light body and creamy carbonation combine for a really put together beer.

I thought I’d had this before and that it wasn’t memorable, but now I’m not so sure. This is a really nice combination of new hops and throwback to English pale ales and early American craft.",4.24
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"L - Poured from a bottle into an oversized wine glass. Pours a medium brown color. Two finger off white/light tan head on medium-aggressive pour. Head appears frothy. Lacing is frothy and dissipates back to head quickly. Reduces down to a film. Can bring back a small head with agitation.

S - Bready malts up front. Some sweetness as well. A little bubble gum or even honey. A little spice too.

T - Taste is a wonderful caramel molasses, with bready malt. Some dark fruits and spice come in also. Bubble gum and cola hits as well. No hoppy bitterness at all. A little bitter chocolate though.

F - Excellent medium mouthfeel and solid carbonation.

O - Overall, this beer is a treat. I love malt-forward beers, and this one does not disappoint. The whole Trappistes Rochefort range is one of my favorites. This is already in my regular rotation, and I highly recommend it to all.",4.63

Bottle Date: L 15.10.2019
Glass: 0.33L Rochefort Chalice/Goblet
Temp at Pour: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Cloudy and opaque chestnut brown with a 1-finger creamy tan head. The head dissipates to a 0.25"" cover that only starts to break up when I start sipping the beer. Excellent lacing down along the glass

Smell:
Sweet fruits along with dark fruits such as dates, raisins, currants, and plums. Touches of brown sugar. Hints of baking spices such as nutmeg and Ceylon cinnamon. Very slight booziness. There is a faint underlying malt note also.

Taste:
Closely follows the nose with the fruits leading the parade but are then joined by more pronounces spices and bready malts. A sip finishes sweet with a very slight alcohol burn.

Feel:
Smooth and velvety with a medium-full body.

Overall:
An outstanding BSDA and an outstanding beer. This bottle is more than a tad old - it is over a year and a half past it's best-before date and was purchased over 6.5 years ago (Nov, 2015). And it is still very, very good.",4.51
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"A careful pour yields a finger and a half of a large frothy white head, which dissipates leaving a white bubbly ring around the glass. A deep, chestnut brown colour that is very cloudy.

It’s got a nose as delicious as any strong Belgian dark, so you know what you’re getting. The stars for Rochefurt 8? Deep aromas of raisins and dried dark fruits, sugared and caramelized desserts and fruits, very rich and gorgeous smelling yeasty, doughy breads. A lot of spices mixing in here, I’ve never been an expert on spices but you can always recognize cloves, though I wouldn’t say that’s the major spice smell here. Cardamom? Blackcurrant?

Lovely and complex taste, which (as contrived as this always sounds) follows the nose pretty tightly. Those doughy, chewy malts are just too enjoyable. Definitely nice and sweet, the high alcohol level brings tastes of rum, raisins, and figs, as they always do for malty Belgian dark ales. Spicy cloves and peppery notes dance around, the candi sugar on the palate also gives me a gentle cinnamon impression, though it intermingles well with all the spices. Long, tasty doughy finish, very malty and bready. Nutty toffee, caramelized desserts. What else can you say? It’s phenomenal as always.

Now, while the flavours are strong for beers in general, I’m going to say they are wonderfully balanced for Belgian dark ales. Strong dark malty beers like Aventinus Eisbock is more of an explosion of these flavours, and certain other Belgian darks are more unrestrained. This works in this beers favour, for anyone who enjoys the style will enjoy the complex evolution of the flavours over time.

Medium bodied and fairly sweet, this is slightly more carbonated than others in this style, medium carbonation overall. The good carbonation coupled with the small bubbles creates a foamy and creamy sip. Semi-dry finish with well concealed alcohol that emerges just enough to breathe life into the flavours on the palate, giving them a unique dimension.

Hell of a beer. Absolutely delicious, while some lament the size of their cellar list, I am always happy I have so many Rochefurt beers in mine!",4.56
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Yowzer! Really do I need to say much more than it's from Belgium. Okay .... Beautiful dark caramel color, super smooth and delicious and packs a punch too .... Terrific!",4.5
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Appearance: Pours a cloudy light brown color with some orange hues towards the bottom. A soft pour produced about three fingers of meringue-like off-white head.

Smell: Yeast, nuts, sugar, old kitchen spices, sage comes to mind as well as allspice.

Taste: Sweet up front, raisin bread, burnt sugar, once the sweetness fades away I get a slightly toasted note along with some nuts. Can't detect any bitterness.

Feel: Medium bodied, loads of carbonation, dry, can't feel any alcohol warmth.

Overall: Delicious. It hides it's abv very well.",4.61
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a chalice glass, the ""best before end"" date is ""L.03.02.2026"" which I understand to be March 2, 2026. I also understand the bottled date is five years prior so that would indicate this one was bottled on March 2, 2021.

APPEARANCE: pours a hazy, brown color and there are larger bits of sediment floating about when held up to light, bountiful two finger head that slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there is some lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a beautiful beer!

SMELL: bread, sweet chocolate, dark fruits like fig and raisin.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet bread and chocolate with dark fruits like fig and raisin, the 9.2% ABV is well disguised.

PALATE: medium body and somewhat creamy, medium carbonation.

OVERALL: this is a great BSDA, I love this style, one of my all time favorites but hard to find, Chimay Blue is the other I can recall having and this one stacks up very well, I will buy this again and will recommend to anyone who enjoys the style.",4.54
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Beige head that fades to a rim and a bit of lace. Sugary brown color.

Nose is sweet and dates.

Taste follows with caramel, a little brown sugar and chocolate, malty sweet.

You already know its gonna be good, its a trappist ale.",4.44
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"L: Pours an opaque light brown with a tan 2 finger head

S: Malt, fig, raisin, spice

T: Complex mix of winter fruit and bready malts. Very smooth for 9.2%—no alcohol burn.

F: Medium bodied with lively carbonation.

O: This is the first beer of the style I’ve tried so I don’t have anything to compare it to. Once I try more, I’ll revisit my review. Still, I’m not surprised it’s #1.",4.12
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Looks a light brown. Large head that lingers. Aroma of sweets, sugar and caramel. Taste is similar with chocolate overtones and figs and slightly dank like a dubbel.

Feel is quite light and sweet. Alcohol very well concealed. A very smooth brown ale with some dankness. Very nice",4.1
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Pours a cloudy, dark amber to mahogany coloration with a medium, fluffy head. Smells of slightly bready, caramel malt and candied fruit, with hints of brown sugar, spice and honey as well. Taste is a great balance of slightly bready, caramel malt and strong candied fruits, with notes of fig, date and plum, as well as lighter apple and apricot, distinct brown sugar and honey, with some spicy accents of clove and cardamon as well. Finishes bittersweet, with a strong sweetness and some candied fruit, brown sugar and hints of spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a rich body and light carbonation.

While this certainly makes for a very rich and complex example of the style, it's just too sweet for my personal taste, which is somewhat mitigated by a light bitterness in the finish, while I can also appreciate those spicy accents, but those overwhelming caramel malt, brown sugar and honey notes are bit much for me, bordering on cloying, while the fruity notes feel quite candied as well, resembling those candied fruit bits you get in fruitcakes. This certainly has a certain feel of fruitcake drenched in honey to it overall and while some may love that, it's really not for me. I much prefer the darker and a bit more roasty and bitter Rochefort 10, which is a lot better balanced to my personal taste.",4.06
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"A-burnt orange cloudy, with prodigious white creamy head from the carbonation. Pour gently.
S-Mild essence of yeasty brown bread, dark fruits
T-Bready nutty malts, spices, sweet but not overly. Below average bitter.
M-Luscious for a medium (-) body. High carbonation.
O-First time for the style, and this specimen is wonderful",4.39
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"I bought a bottle today at the LCBO in Ontario 330ml at 9.2%.
Poured a 1 to 2finger head into glass.
Leaving a lace all around as you drink it.
The beer is strong just sipping on it but it seems very easy to drink it with a medium bitterness level.
Overall a great Belgium beer
Cheers",4.09
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Purchased at the LCBO on 11/11/21. Stored at 4 C, on it's side, and poured into a chalice.

Appearance - Pours a maduro brown, it's the spitting image of the wrapper of the cigar I'll be smoking after dinner, a CAO Flathead Carb 660, with a medium thickness white head that quickly diminishes to a thin film, a little thicker in the center.

Smell - Strong fruits with a nice nutty, malty undertone tying it all together. I'm picking up raisins, currants and it reminds me of fruitcake. In the best way possible, I like a rich, well made fruitcake.

Taste - Just a slight hint of alcohol burn at first taste, which is quickly killed by the maltyness. The above noted fruit flavours then rush in and it's a long finish more malt and baking spices.

Feel - I love the creamyness of this beer, it's full bodied with carbonation on the milder side of medium. Nicely coats the mouth, enhancing the finish.

Overall - This is one of my favourite beers. Top 3. I prefer it over the 10. The mix of the flavours and just how it's so beautiful tied together is something of beauty.",5.0
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Appearance: Cloudy, saddle brown. Mousse-like, tan head with great retention

Aroma: Fruity esters: plum, apricot, apple

Flavor & aftertaste: Follow aroma, plum, apricot, apple. Low bitterness

Mouth-feel: Medium to full- bodied. Moderate carbonation. A little creamy

Overall: Outstanding. Would never know this is a 9.2% abv beer. Nice looking pour with excellent head and retention. Layered fruity esters in the aroma & flavor. These beers always fool me at first. Their aromas seem one or two dimensional at first, but as you make your way to the bottom of the glass, keep swirling and sniffing and more complexity comes out. Very easy drinking. No flaws in this bottle.",5.0
Trappistes Rochefort 8,"Dark raisin brown in color. Poured with a fizzy, tall, off-white foam with medium low retention. Aromas of dark fruit, sweet fig, and mellow dark malt. Medium bodied with assertive carbonation. Dark fruity flavors, fig and raisin, with mellow dark malts - similar to aroma. Very low spicy hop flavor followed by pleasant boozy warmth through the end. Finished dryly as the fruity and malty presence was overtaken by the booziness. A pleasant, boozy, cool weather ale. Very nice.",4.16
Heineken Lager Beer,"This is without a doubt, the most inconsistent beer on the market. Majority of the time I have had one, it' been skunky and not enjoyable at all. Yeah, the look s good and the feel is pleasant, but the skunky, bitter taste leaves you not wanting another. Freshness and storage is key to getting a Heineken that tastes okay.",2.7
Heineken Lager Beer,"Drank from 12 oz green bottle; no birth date. Taste of flat carbonation with slight but don’t biuscut taste. For what it is, there is far better out there",3.6
Heineken Lager Beer,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Shaker pint glass, ""best by"" date ""May - 2023"".

APPEARANCE: pours a clear, light golden color with 1 finger white head with decent retention, the head slowly dissipated until a thin, broken layer of small bubbles remained, there was minimal lacing on the glass, medium carbonation.

SMELL: sweet corn and Euro skunk.

TASTE: the taste follows the nose, initially sweet corn and then a skunky Euro hop profile.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: I used to drink this at the country club and thought it was classy, until the craft beer movement changed my life forever, now I just think it's another AAL except the bottle is green and it was brewed in Holland, it's overly sweet and skunky, I would not seek this out again.",2.72
Heineken Lager Beer,"I put together a mix-six at the local supermarket. I included a bottle of Heineken. I hadn't had a Heineken in years--maybe 40; I remember it as a crisp, fresh, beer, much better than the American AALs of the era. I saw the ""malt lager"" appellation on the label, and thought that this must be a new product, an all-malt Heineken. Turns out it's the same, classic Heineken: It's an adjunct based lager, a bit hoppy but with a sweet overlay in the flavor that I suppose is a result of the corn in the recipe. I was a bit surprised by the extent to which I disliked it--I could barely finish the bottle. The sweetness clung to it all the way down. I love all things Dutch--visiting the country, cycling in it, exploring and savoring Amsterdam--with the exception, I guess, of this beer.",2.47
Heineken Lager Beer,"Poured from a 24oz can best by March 2023 into a pils glass.

On thr pour a fine 3 finger head forms woth a light straw body that has strong carbonation. Head retention is good, but it becomes fizzy looking. Vague lacing.

Aroma is largely light skunked hops, mistreated lager yeast, and some light but bright esters. Maybe some vague corniness but not a lot of malt other than that.

Taste is quite similar to the smell woth the same off notes right up front. As some of the cheap euro characteristics fade a slight floral happiness does stick through in the largely bitter hop extract. Once again a light and oxidized corny maltiness barely shows up on the finish.

Feel is fizzy with a lot of carbonation bite. It's easy to drink but not the smoothest from all the off flavors. Not as watery as expected but bretty light. Longer finish but not great.

Overall this is a meh beer that's overpriced I only picked it up because it's the last thing that isn't a high gravity malt liquor left that I haven't reviewed out of the 24oz singles at my local shitty liquor store. I wish it was maltier, but I guess the hops are actually detectable albeit gross.",2.63
Heineken Lager Beer,"Light Golden color, clear and has a white head. Smells very malt forward with a hint of citrus. Taste alright, kinda boring. Malty, some nuttiness and a hint of citrusy crispness. Overall its a alright, easy drinker. Its refreshing but its nothing special.",3.57
Heineken Lager Beer,"Imported Heineken is horrible.
I had it on tap on the Rock of Gibraltar and it was amazing.
It could have been the fact that it was very hot & I was very thirsty, but that was the best Heiny I ever had!
The bottled stuff to me tastes like stale hops and moldy malt.
I despise it.",1.68
Heineken Lager Beer,"Best By Date: September 2022

A - Light gold pour with vibrant carbonation.

S - Caramel, rice, and corn aroma.

T - Starts with some light earthy caramel malt followed with very light citrus, and then has a slight bit of toasted caramel on the finish.

M - Light medium body

O - This beer is what it is. It's been a staple in the beer world for a long time but not my gig. The fact I'm actually writing a review is really a feat in itself. This beer was brewed for quaffing, not sipping. All good.",3.12
Heineken Lager Beer,Drinkable beer if it’s fresh and ice cold. Once it begins to warm up the taste turns sour and skunky. This is a beer I’ll drink if it’s given to me but will never buy. At $3.40 per can in Ontario there are a lot of better options at the same price or cheaper.,2.6
Heineken Lager Beer,"Sparkling pale gold with a tall white head settling to a very thickly persistent white blanket clinging well in doily lacing.

Just now realizing I have only ever had Heine Light, this is way less skunky than its younger sister, and it's actually got some faint banana characteristics. Color me dumbfounded!

Aside from that, there are notes of fresh baked buns with a slight tang of lemon rind, and its got a fluffy medium body that finishes semi-dry.

Wow, I really thought this would be a sub-3 score.",3.22
Heineken Lager Beer,"My first Heineken—I made sure to get it in a can to avoid risk of skunk. Smell was fine—a little fruity. Taste is just meh. Not the worst macro, but not as flavorful as the crafts I prefer. Average at best.",2.83
Heineken Lager Beer,How this has survived for so long is well beyond my ability to comprehend. Throughout all the many years I've occasionally revisited this vile stuff it's always had a rather revolting aroma which carries through into the taste. An off-taste which appears popular.,1.36
Tank 7,"Bottle with a best by date of 14-Nov-2022. Pours a somewhat opaque amber-yellow color. Great aroma - yeasty and spicy, pours with a nice, fluffy white head. Taste explodes in the mouth - a bit of lemon, spices and a pleasant hint of yeast. This is an excellent beer - it hides the 8.5% abv pretty well and never feels hot. Taste lingers on the palate in a pleasant way and makes you want more. Excellent!",4.35
Tank 7,"Generically rated as I haven't had it in awhile, but easily a favorite of mine. Has any eggy yeast taste that leaves me craving more. Personally one of my top 5 favorite.",4.24
Tank 7,"This is my first rating and I’m learning about beer as I go, but I felt compelled to talk about one of my favorites.

Brewed in Kansas City Missouri

Smell of banana with a medium sour aftertaste. Refreshing but also filling.",4.79
Tank 7,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Color is a pale amber with a two and a half finger head. Decent lacing. Fluffy head like a Coke Float. Hazy, foggy. The fluffy head stays and stays.

S - Yeast front and center on the scent. Sweet and earthy. Some citrus or pear skin as well. Sour scents as well.

T - Taste follows scent. Yeast and sweetness. Like sourdough with sweet cream butter spread across it.

F - Medium to thick mouthfeel with some frothiness.

O - Overall this beer is a treat. Wonderful yeast flavors. I was introduced to Boulevard by a friend from Kansas City, and Tank 7 has been a favorite for years. It’s definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a yeast beer.",4.43
Tank 7,"16oz can with a best by date of 9-17-22. Opened 5-8-22.
Huge meringue like white head that crests over the rim and has amazing retention. Orange-gold, not opaque but close. Tons of visible carbonation. Thick lace. Apricot and lemon nose with some yeast character. Stone fruit, grassy hop bitterness and white pepper (?) spice. Drinkability is high - packs a punch at 8.5%. Medium body with high carbonation. Long, fruity and dry finish. Outstanding.",4.27
Tank 7,"Look: hazy gold, nice white head, good lacing.

Smell: A little banana-y, definitely belgian-y.

Taste: the banana backs off, other eaters still present. Note of cloves. Some malty sweetness as you would expect, followed by a mild lemonish dryness that cleans the palate.

Feel: the fizz is just right, lightens the feel well.

Overall: it is, in fact, an American Saison. It brings in the base flavors of a Saison Dupont, but lightens them, with more emphasis on the hop/citrus.",4.53
Tank 7,"Look: It pours golden and clear with a white head. It has excellent head retention.

Smell: It has a spicy aroma with coriander and lemon. There are some yeasty and earthly elements as well.

Taste: It has a spicy flavor with a bit of dough and coriander. It has some lemon in the background with some pepper. There are also earthly elements and a bit of yeast as well.

Feel: It has a medium body with a dry finish.

Overall, there are strong spicy flavors with light fruitless in the background and other complex flavors.",4.12
Tank 7,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a long lived tall foamy head and a lot of lacing.

Great wine, orange, bready yeast flavors.
Unique flavor combination. Smooth mouthfeel with no alcohol heat. Lasting carbonation.
ABV is too high to drink all day, but wonderful in moderation.",4.67
Tank 7,"While not a perfect traditional version Saison, this beer has become a essential household favorite. I was extremely skeptical at first because my standard for Saisons is high. This beer pours a clear golden into a tulip glass and holds a clean white head, but not too much. Finishes distinctly edgier than that a traditional Saison, but the bittering hops resemble a slightly citrusy and grapefruitlike finish. As an individual and enjoyable beer, I cant find many faults. The taste is smooth and well balanced. It finishes clean and crisp. On occasion during the lakefront summers, I add a splash of lemonade. Of the zillions of beers the Boulevard makes, this is my crown jewels favorite of theirs.",4.4
Tank 7,"Extremely pretty beer. Bright, orangey yellow with a strikingly white head. Nose is Belgian yeast with subtle barnyard notes. In the mouth it's soft at first, with prickly carbonation coming to the fore as the beer sits on the tongue.

There's the usual Saison peppery, funky yeast profile and candy sugar sweetness that dominates at first, with some American hop character following, mainly on the orange/grapefruit side of the spectrum.

Beer finishes dry and peppery.

Very nice beer!",4.21
Tank 7,"Hazy bright gold with a tower of snow white foam that rings + sheets; challah dough and musty lemon rind with bits of bubblegum, white pepper + flowers; honey on fresh bread, pears, marmalade, a bit of cellar, slight rubber bands + pepper, then herbal, grassy, spicy finish; med, thick, smooth, no heat.

4.25 4 4 3.75 3.75

A good looker, and the nose says a lot: sweet, low on phenols, high on esters, and with a thread of farmhouse.
The taste is as advertised: orchard fruit esters piling onto a pils + candy sugar base (I’m guessing) with not quite enough pepper or clove, but an unexpected hint of earth instead, then a bunch of hop aromas without much bitterness.
This is too sweet, both literally + sensually. The main thing about saison, to me, is the dryness, and regardless of the final gravity, this doesn’t give the impression of finishing dry. You’d never call this “crisp”.
I’ve heard it’s American hops in here; if so, they’re boosting the esters with citrus + other fruit where they shouldn’t be. And the 38 IBUs need to be closer to 45 or even 50.
Don’t get me wrong, the craftsmanship is on point: handsome, burn-free, and goes down easy.
And I read where this is a food beer; I can see that - it *needs* food to cut through all the fruit on show here.
But it’s not what the Belgians call “digestible” - and whatever its other merits, I can’t forgive it that.

I wanted to love this, and it’s tasty, but I didn’t want a second.",3.94
Tank 7,"Drinking this at home.
Poured from a 16 ounce can into a pint glass.
Looks golden orange with a nice dense foamy head that dropped quickly to a thick cap.
Smells yeasty, orange, grapefruit funky.
Taste follows the nose nicely and not boozy at all despite the higher ABV.
Mouth feel is medium for the style.
Overall an excellent Saison that I would definitely drink again and will be looking in stores for.

Tank 7,"This is GREAT for a saison. A little strong, of course. If you can stand certain IPAs, and love Boulevard's other exceptional releases, then this is for you.",4.22
Tank 7,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a 4-pack for $13.99. I purchased this in early February 2021, even though it was from a high-turnover store, and it was canned on 8/19/20 (best by May 2021). So it's over 15 months old. No big deal though as I've had this beer aged and I've had it relatively fresh and it was enjoyable either way.

Look: Pours a beautiful light copper color with a frothy, thick, rocky off-white head and a subtle haze. The head slowly subsided to almost nothing, but left behind some nice lacing.

Smell: Very aromatic with notes of citrus - lemon peel and grapefruit pith and zest - along with pepper and funky saison yeast. Smells both hoppy and dry. The nose is also somewhat ""juicy"". Makes me think that it is going to be mouth-watering and refreshing. A bit of alcohol on the nose as it warms.

Taste: Delicious. Amazing that this beer, in a can, has such a long shelf life. It may have lost some of its hoppy aromatic qualities and brightness, but it is still good. While the nose gives the impression that the beer is going to be juicy, this beer is far from it on the palate. Up front, it's slightly sweet and citrusy. There is a grainy, bready maltiness that comes through in spite of the hops. The effervescent beer quickly transitions to its spicy, bitter, extremely dry, grapefruit pithy finish that lingers super long on the palate. It's crazy that this beer is 8.5% ABV. The alcohol is barely noticeable, and I would have believed you if you told me that this is 6.0% ABV. The ""funkiness"" is reserved and I don't get any off those off-putting medicinal flavors that sometimes come along with other farmhouse ales.

Feel: The carbonation is perfect and the body is medium. Nice mouthfeel.

Overall: What a great hoppy American saison. It's awesome that this beer is so good and so accessible, coming from a brewery with such wide distribution as Boulevard. I do think that I prefer this beer when it is fresher. Even still, it is solid and it has developed a different character with a bit of age on it.",4.23
Corona Extra,"What can I write that hasn't been written or said of this beer. The highest selling Mexican beer in the World. The greatest marketing of Mexican Beers.

Corona Extra,"Poured from a can into a glass. The appearance is crystal clear straw color with a soapy white head that quickly fizzles away.

The aroma is slightly sweet, green apple and corn with hints of flower and grass.

The taste is pretty much the same as the nose. Green apple skins, grainy, lightly sweet, hints of corn, a little bit of white flowers and grass on the back end. Zero bitterness. Finishes as crisp as the aforementioned apple.

Mouthfeel is...fine? Light but not watery. Fizzy. Drinks like a pretty typical carbonated beverage. Super crisp and clean, though. Almost nothing is residual.

Wow. I was surprised by how much I liked this, at least from this format. A skunky bottle might have given me a more negative impression. This is a solid, refreshing corn lager. If you go in thirsty with no aloft expectations, you'll probably enjoy it, too!",3.84
Corona Extra,"consumed straight from the 12oz clear glass bottle. typical cheap, easy drinking lager smell and taste. nothing fancy but i think that’s the idea here. i can kind of see why they add a lime to this beer as it helps offset the somewhat “cheaper” beer flavor with some citrusy zest. decent mouthfeel though. it’s got some bubbly carbonation and crispness to it. it’s not a half bad thirst quencher on a hot day. personally, i’d take modelo or pacifico over this.",3.38
Corona Extra,"Poured into a pils glass from a 24oz can best by December 2022

On the pour a decent head forms then immediately dissipates entirely. Body is a golden yellow with average carbonation, crystal clear.

Aroma is skunked, even in the can. I wonder if getting the beer lightstruck is part of the process. It still has some detectable not ruined hops but even so there is some cheap lager aroma here as well. Not bad but not great. Some vague sweet malts are detectable under everything else going on.

Flavor is quite similar to the smell, but with less lager flavor although retaining the skunkiness. Some hop bitterness is there but the skunk is present the whole time. A corny light and sweet malt finish does come eventually after a weird tartness subsides, no wonder people drink this with lime.

Feel is easy drinking crisp and very highly carbonated. Quite light but has a surprisingly long finish that is actually pleasant.

Overall this is a pretty flavorful lawnmower beer that still feels light. Hops are present unlike a lot of beers in the category but there's also a lot off about it. Nothing disgusting as I think a lot of it is intentional but I've had better.",2.79

Taste is fairly mild, but dominated by the yeasty funk. Grassiness follows, then maybe a little grainy sweetness. A surprising bitterness builds, and I get a little lemon zest.

L: Pours light hazed apricot color, medium low carbonation, creamy 1"" soft white head w/dents, good retention, random sticky lacing.
S: Sugary Xmas cookie dough, honey, graham cracker, caramelized malts, a hint of dark berries, a trace of alcohol as beer warms.

F: Sharp & tart, lightly tacky med-heavy bodied mouthfeel w/a med-long drying finish.
O: A big tasting and large feeling IPA with enthusiastic amounts of hop tang. It is redolent perhaps of a Christmas Ale in it's depth. Stately, broad and big, it is outstanding in it's style.",4.35
Flower Power,"This is purely subjective. Clearly, it’s a great beer! I got to try this on an endless layover in NYC where it was offered in bottles at the lounge. The honey notes arent a world of flavor I personally love as much, but the beer itself is nice and balanced and a quality zipper — especially when waiting eight hours for a flight.",3.7
Flower Power,"Honey colored with no head to speak of. Nose is slightly sweet, but also a bit pungent. Tasting is where the magic happens. Bitter is the best adjective available, but it is great bitterness that follows through the entire palate. Great beer!",4.56
Flower Power,"Review 1554

My continuation for beers I usually would not consume. The beer is 44 degrees and served in an IPA glass. The pour created a two-fingered off-white head. The head retention is excellent; it slowly dissipated, leaving some lacing on the glass. An amber yellow with orange hues, charting around SRM 7. This beer is clear with some carbonation bubbles.

I first smell floral esters, pine, herbal, and biscuits. Nosing further, I recognize lightly toasted malts, grapefruit, a hint of dankness, a touch of mango, and pineapple.

The flavors in the beer are floral esters, pine resin, herbal, biscuity, lightly toasted malts, pineapple, and grapefruit.

The mouthfeel of the beer is astringent and dry.

The body of the beer is medium-plus, medium carbonation, and a full finish.

An excellent IPA Full flavor and bright.",4.27

Flower power paved the way for my introduction to IPAs.

Old Chub,"Poured from a 12oz can, canned on 12-7-2021

On the pour a nice, tan, 3 finger head forms filling my pint glass, it then recedes over a couple minutes to a thin foam cap and ring around the glass. The color is a very dark reddish brown that becomes a dark brown red in the light. Lazy carbonation finds its way to the surface.

Smell is quite roasty but with strong notes of dried date from the mingling of yeast and malts. Some vague hopping possibly detected? Definitely a complex malt forward traditional scotch ale smell. Quite sweet.

Taste follows the smell but brings more roast amd leaves a little bit of the dark fruitiness. It is still present but it shows up more with the slight wave of bitterness after the sweet caramel malt notes pass. The bitterness does build a bit as you drink, as well as sweet yeast character. Quite a complex beer, quite low ibu I'm assuming however.

Feel is quite velvety, and not too heavy especially for the abv. It does stay on the palate a bit and Definitely isn't watery but it is very easy to drink.

Overall a traditional scotch ale from an American brewery. And a very interesting yeast and malt character at that. Some hops present in the form of a vague bitterness, but quite earthy and sweet. This is good.",4.01
Old Chub,"This is a 12oz. can poured into my Oskar Blues pint glass. The brew is a dark brown, to dark to observe the carbonation. The head is almost a finger of thick tan foam that quickly recedes to a thin cap.
The aroma is sweet malts, toffee..
The flavor starts sweet, some cocoa, a touch of coffee, then there is a crisp dryness with a little alcohol bite at the finish .
The palate feels a smoothness up front, a slight dryness, and a little heat from the 8% ABV.
This tastes very good and I keep going back for more, but I suggest you sip this one and enjoy. I think this one could sneak up on a guy!",4.08
Old Chub,"Brownish red color with a half inch of light tan head. The nose is chocolate, toasted whole wheat bread, rye, wet grain, and a touch of coffee. The taste is almond toffee, brown bread, molasses, hazelnuts with the skin on, roasted corn, and a delicious maltiness. Very nicely balanced beer that goes from mildly sweet to barely dry to a light lingering bitterness. The mouthfeel is a pleasant creaminess that borders on chewy. The key here is the malty grainy toffee taste. This is a very good drinkable beer.",4.18
Old Chub,"Very good beer, complex and chewy, woodsy flavors of maple syrup, raisin, butterscotch, cocoa, toasted bread, caramel, vanilla, licorice. The expected sweetness for the style is nicely balanced by a touch of bitterness and even a hint of minty pine as the flavors linger. Excellent smooth rich feel, thick but not sticky, with a great jolt of lively fizz. My personal favorite of the Scotch ales. A malt monster, not for hopheads. An excellent beer as close to flawless as I've had.",4.43
Old Chub,"Deep reddish brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma of roasted malts, nut, cocoa, and dark fruits. Taste is sweet of cola and dark cherries, nutty roasted malts and a definite smoked flavor. Some marshmallow as well. Nice medium chewy mouthfeel. Alcohol is held in check by the full malt flavors and overall this is a nice ale.",4.04

Old Chub,"355 mL can from the LCBO; dated Aug 14 2020 and served barely chilled. This is the last of a 4-pack that I bought in late 2020.

Pours a muddied brownish-amber colour, with a deliberately rough pour producing half an inch of foamy beige head. It leaves behind a thin collar, but little else worth mentioning - though a good swirl does leave some spotty lacing and legs behind. Mostly just sweet on the nose - lots of caramel and toffee, with notes of cherry red licorice candy, dates and figs; these obscure subtler suggestions of toasted bread, molasses, plum and alcohol.

A fine beer, indeed - complex and flavourful, though the scales are certainly tipped toward the 'malt' side of the equation, with an almost fruit cake-like flavour at the forefront. There's caramel, toffee, toasted bread and molasses, as well as cherry, prune, date and fig; hints of cocoa and smoked malt at the finish, leading in to a slightly warming aftertaste with lingering hints of toffee, earthiness and dark fruits, as well as a touch of booziness. Medium in body, with relatively low carbonation levels that weakly brush against the surface of the tongue; feels smooth and a little slick on the palate. If you've got more than one can, you might want to pace yourself - it's easy to pour down the hatch, but as Samuel Jackson once said, it'll get'cha drunk.

Final Grade: 4.2, an awesome A-. Old Chub has been on my wants list for a couple years, and I'm thrilled to strike it off. I don't know if this is the best scotch ale I've ever had - it's tasty for sure, with a varied array of flavours, and the 8% is exceedingly well-integrated. That being said, the smoked malt aspects are fairly subtle, and overall it's a little sweet for my tastes - minor flaws for this style, of course, if they can even be considered flaws in the first place. If you see this beer and are in any way curious, do not hesitate to purchase it - I'll be doing so again at the first opportunity.",4.2
Old Chub,"Pours deep mahogany with amber glints and a small toffee colored head. Huge raisin, caramel, stewed fruit notes in the nose. The taste is intensely malty with roasty notes mixed with berry and fruity notes. Leafy, woody hops in the back. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Cherry, chocolate and roasted barley notes in the finish.

A nice Wee Heavy. Very malty and complex. A must try if you like malty beers.",4.29
Old Chub,"L: Pours a very deep brown, mahogany if you will. Accompanied by a somewhat thin tan head.
S: Smells rich of toasted malts, sweet, little bit of caramel, dark fruits, toffee, kind of bready.
T: Very much follows the nose, chocolate & vanilla are present in the taste as well.
F: I would say full-bodied, low carbonation, warming feeling from the alcohol, but not too much, smooth...
O: Really impressed by this one, definitely will buy again.",4.48
Old Chub,"look: two finger off white head which quickly dissipates to a thin layer of bubbles, beer is a clear mahogany colour with good levels of carbonation in the beer.

smell: quite a nice aroma, smokey, peaty, scotch, black bread, toffee, dark fruits, cherry, prune, raisin, fig, molasses, treacle, smells boozy enough, nice sweetness to it.

taste: a tasty malty ale, brown and black bread, toast, smokey, ash, a touch oaky, some whiskey, scotch whiskey, peaty, caramel and toffee, sweet dark fruits, fig and raisin, sweet fruits and smokey malts linger on the finish, as well as some bitterness, quite nice.

feel: medium bodied, light to medium carbonation, would be nice if it was a bit fuller bodied, some alcohol warming, quite drinkable for its strength

overall: a most pleasant ale from oskar blue’s, very easy drinking at eight percent, and quite tasty.",4.04
Old Chub,"Clear mahogany appearance with a large beige head and very good lacing. Malty aroma dotted with caramel, walnut shells and toffee. Earthy, smoky, toasty, grainy flavor, a touch of licorice, more caramel sweetness. Finally, at the very back of the palate, a modest amount of floral hops. Medium-to-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel. Alcohol is warming but not intrusive. Overall, just really nice and pleasant.",4.21
Old Chub,"On tap at Das Beer Garden. Deep brown. Smells of toffee and caramel. Light butterscotch notes. Tastes of toasty malts, hop bitterness, then toffee and faint hints of butterscotch. Medium heavy. Hoppy enough to barely taste like a wee heavy. Mostly tastes like a big, sweet brown ale, but hints of the scotch ale come back in the back end.",3.78
Old Chub,"Poured into a pint glass. Pours a dark amber with a tiny head that dissolved pretty quickly, however, there was some nice lacing left behind.

Smells mainly of caramel malts, toffee, coffee, chocolate and a hint of dark fruit.

This brew evolved as it warmed, initially when it was cold I was only able to pick up the caramel and the coffee up front with a hint of the dark fruit, but the latter flavors and aroma came alive once it warms up. When it warms it approaches cloying, however I am completely fine with that because sweet beers are my thing. Medium mouthfeel. Pretty tasty brew, cheers! Only thing that's somewhat disappointing is that I'm not picking up much of the smokiness. I paired this with lamb chops.",4.15

Prima Pils,"Canned 5/23/22. Best by 11/23/22.

L: Pours a clear gold with a medium fluffy white head that thins to a sticky film. Irregular and thin lacing.

S: Bready aroma, with a bit of lemon and just a touch of dank.

T: Bread up front, followed by some earthiness. Finishes nicely; dry and slightly bitter.

F: Medium mouthfeel and carbonation.

O: Well-made, if not exceptional. The earthy/musty/dank element seems a bit out of place, but not unpleasant.",3.79
Prima Pils,"Pours a bright golden hay with a moderate head that dissipates slowly. Lacing is on the lighter side.

Lots of grassy hop notes touch the nose. There is a herbal quality there too.

The sip keeps the grassy and herbal notes going. A light grainy character sits in behind. It’s all punctuated by a crisp almost spicy finish.

Light bodied, well carbonated and very enjoyable.

This is an excellent American Pilsner. Up there with my favourites from Suarez, Live Oak and Olde Mecklenberg.",4.29
Prima Pils,"12oz bottle received as a gift from a friend. This beer is often available in mix-a-six packs for $2/bottle. Says Best By 12 Apr 22; it's about 5 weeks past that date.

Look: Golden light straw color with a very small white head and lots of tiny bubbles rising up. Has the slightest chill haze.

Smell: Smells lemony, spicy, and earthy. There is a nice bready malt backbone with a good amount of sweetness too (think apple juice). I think there's a bit of skunkiness here too, and I'm okay with that. After swirling the glass, I get green bell pepper notes on the finish.

Taste: This is a very traditional German pilsner style. It's very light and slightly sweet on the palate up front, and the finish is crisp and bitter. This beer is very hoppy but it's not resiny at all; the hop character is slightly floral, but mostly citrusy and the finish is rindy / pithy without being juicy at all. A lot of spicy character also...lingering on my palate is an almost peppery, earthy flavor. There is a bit of skunkiness, but it's my own fault for not drinking and reviewing this sooner. That being said, I don't really mind it so it's all good.

Feel: Light to medium mouthfeel. Crisp and refreshing. Carbonation is appropriate. Very easy drinking.

Overall: This is renowned to be one of the better American-made Pilsners and I would say that it lives up to the hype. It's very easy to drink and fairly enjoyable without being boring. I just wish that it was easier to find this beer fresh; even though I live just outside of Philadelphia, it's not so easy to find and when you find it, it's often not so fresh. I think that's because so much of America is suffering from IPA-itis, a lot of beer stores are not having high turnover with beers like Victory Prima Pils so it tends to sit on the shelves for a while or a lot of stores have even stopped carrying it. I also with that Victory would brew their Home Grown Lager again, but that's a discussion topic for another time.

From the bottle:
A crisp yet distinct Pilsner brewed with German hops that bring vivid notes of floral and spice with citrus and lemon. This is truly brilliant, bringing nuanced complexity together with smooth, easy drinking.

Prima Pils,"I have never reviewed what is probably my most drank beer of all time so here we go…

Pours beautifully light straw color, crystal crystal clear. Vigorous pour leaves a nice big fluffy white head with good retention and some nice lacing to.

Smell is so much grass, spicy and floral hops and a bright snappy maybe grainy malt aroma.

Taste leans into the hops as well, the floral hop bite show more in the taste than nose. Grassy and cracker like and spicy hop finish.

Super super clean and easy to drink, dry and nice bitter finish. Grassy like bitterness that lingers well after the sip is gone, the dry finish enhances this aspect in a very nice way.

Prima Pils,"Labeled German Style Pilsner. Look and feel is pilsner and acceptable within the style. But, all I taste from this beer is grassy hops. To call it a German pilsner, this falls short by Victory. They need to sample Warsteiner, Wernesgruner, Spatan, Bitburger, Paulaner, Kulmbacher, etc. Mexico made Bohemia Pilsner is a far better German pilsner than Victory Pils.

Light golden beer and a white sticky head that together just look crisp.

Sweet cracker malt, mowing sweet grass, and a whiff of sulphur.

The initial taste is corn and crackers. That sweet corn remains an undertone to very floral, sweet grassy hops that carry me through to a slightly herbal, crisp finish.

Rather a full body, but crisp with plenty of carbonation.

Flavor: Intense flavors of rich chocolate, coffee, toasted black malt, and some vanilla and rich chocolate on the end mixed with some mild earthy toasted malt and smooth espresso roast notes. (4.50)

Feel: A large body. Rich and smooth without being too cloying or thick. Appropriately and surprisingly clean and dry for 10.2%. (4.25)

Compared to North Coast Old Rasputin 1/16/22: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More chocolate and espresso bean roast. Less black malt, earthy notes, and root beer.

Narwhal,"Pours black with a medium persistent rich tan head. Smell is roasted malt, some coffee notes, maybe even a little dark fruit. Taste has a big sweet backbone but it's overwhelmed by the bitter roasted malt. Great malt profile that's hard to place. Dark chocolate and coffee notes, but that's a bit of a cop out to describe what's a more complicated malt taste. Spicy warming boozy finish.

Smell - Dark roasted character primarily. Then some caramel and chocolate and vanilla, and alcohol. It really doesn't hide the alcohol very well. 4.25

Taste - Dark roasted coffee. I just now read the description on the back label and it literally says word for word ""dark roasted coffee"". So yeah, it sure lives up to that. Baker's cocoa noticeable too, as it notes. It's not bad by any means. But this style has very stiff competition, and I rate within style. 4

Mouthfeel - A little harsh. Boozy. Full bodied. But a relatively clean finish for the style, which isn't saying too much. 4

An excellent Russian Imperial Stout which will be present in my cellar going forward.",4.28
Narwhal,"I can't say much that hasn't been said, so cutting to the chase this is a very good RIS deserving of the rating.

It pours a thick looking oily black, very clear.

The smell is of chocolate, freshly brewed coffee, char, molasses and I think just a hint of licorice.

What I find surprising in the taste is the chocolate, but this is fresh and I look forward to letting this age and seeing how it changes, but right now I am getting a significant chocolate flavor, that seems slightly sweet at first but as the coffee and roasted malt takes over, the sweet sensation fades to a hefty but short-lived combo bite of char, espresso, acridity, and some bitterness. Coffee acridity and char lingers a little, but pleasantly.

Even young, no alcohol beyond a pleasant warmth. I'd call it medium body, somewhat creamy, just enough carbonation to hold it up. Glad I have five more to play with later, anticipating this to be even better with some time.",4.1

The beer looks more like a soft drink in the glass than a beer. Its clarity is astounding for a brown beer; it's a burnished copper with light brown highlights where the light reflects from the glass. But that is as good as this beer gets.

Aroma-wise, there's a sweet, syrupy cola/Dr.Pepper mix that brought to the fore thoughts of fly spray and even citronella. There was nothing appealing at all about the smell, in fact quite the opposite.

Taste is no improvement on the smell. It's as sweet as the aroma hints, and there's that cola/Dr.Pepper thing going on. It's clearly a light struck beer as evidenced by the skunky, metallic taste that overrides everything else.

In the mouth it's thin and light, just like a soft drink.

Overall this is a disappointing shell of a beer. I understand it's now brewed under licence, and can only presume it's been bastardised in the name of fiscal efficiency. Well, I can't imagine ever paying to drink this beer again, so I suppose it will help with my fiscal efficiency, so mission accomplished?

Cheers!",1.22
Newcastle Brown Ale,"Gave the look a four because it looks like a Newcastle Brown Ale. However, my understanding is that this is now a Lagunitas product. Combined with the recipe change five or six years ago, the firm’s obstinate refusal to do away with the clear glass that ruins the beer and selling out to macro garbage like Lagunitas, this is undrinkable swill. One of the admonishments from BA is that we’re supposed to be respectful of the brewer. That statement is obviously ridiculous, taken out of context. I understand the idea behind it though. As such, I didn’t give it straight ones.
I have had Newcastle Brown Ale in not a few pubs across the pond, as far back as 1997. Reviewing that beer would be a wonderful time. Drinking this (er, taking two swallows and pouring out the rest) was such a departure from those halcyon days, I may have unconsciously used this beer as a stand in for my deep regret of having returned to the Disneyland Freakshow States of Oligopoly.
Whatever the case, this is tragic. No, this was never the finest beer. But it was relatively inexpensive and decent (out of a keg) - pretty much the opposite of whatever this is.",1.63
Newcastle Brown Ale,"Drank this so much and so often in the 90s I certainly tried, and failed, to replicate it when I took up brewing. Wasn't even close, enjoy one very now and again, but of course there's better browns about these days.",3.91
Newcastle Brown Ale,"Dark brown look with a nice foamy beige head that recedes to a ring. Ruby look in light. Malty smell, rye bread smell, New York bagel hints. Low bitterness taste with a bready, malty, low low hip taste. Pretty bland. Watery but still vicious feel in your mouth. No super creamy, but not super citrusy. Middle of the road beer.",3.31
Newcastle Brown Ale,"I still remmeber stealing a few of these out of my dad's minifridge to bring to a neighbor girl's house, swigging it while grimacing, pretending to like it...

It's a supremely bland take on the brown ale, with tons of budweiser flavor and none of the savory goodness a true brown ale should have. Gutter tripe",2.35
Newcastle Brown Ale,"They can do better. The first time I made my own beer for a youtube video, I made a kit called ""back to basics beer"" It was nothing fancy, 6.6 pounds of DME, some copper colored grain in a bag some hops and Nottingham yeast packet. My beer, with mistakes I made like squeezing the bag, stirring the wort, not mixing the priming sugar with hot water and some other rookie mistakes, my beer came out tasting better than a New Castle Brown Ale. NCBA is good with making beer bread with it, but not drinking it. This is just okay I prefer Bass Ale over NCBA.",2.83
Newcastle Brown Ale,"What could they possibly have been thinking when Lagunitas turned Newcastle into this syrupy brown pablum of an excuse for a beer? This was a unique ale in almost every way, but foremost in flavor and texture. Now it is entirely unremarkable. Avoid this like the plague if you are expecting anything like what this justly famous ale was known for.",1.35
Newcastle Brown Ale,"Purchased as a six-pack from Wal-Mart for $9.99. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Clear brown, with a red tinge. Two-finger quick-to-dissipate tan head.
S - Bready, nutty. Some biscuit and toast notes. Slight pepper on the back.
T - Caramel. Toast. Pumpernickel bread. A slight sweetness, but not sweet overall.
F - Extremely carbonated. Refreshing. Despite the color, it's light in body.
O - I would say this beer sets a certain bar for a certain type of beer that's cheap, satisfying to drink, and goes well with every meal. Not a bad beer in the slightest, but I wish it had more of a bitterness to it. On the pricier end of the spectrum for a macrobrew, but I wouldn't mind getting this every so often. Would recommend trying at least once.",3.45
Newcastle Brown Ale,"(Bottle). A good but somewhat overrated beer. Aggressively carbonated. Better in the Good Old Days when it was stronger.

Rerate, draught in Newcastle: I found the colour to be darker brown than the bottled version (can that be?), and the flavour was fuller and richer - even though the pub tried to ruin it by serving it ice cold.",3.25
Newcastle Brown Ale,"Newcastle, 12oz. bottle poured into my weizen glass(20oz.) starts with a nice three finger head of a light tan foam. After several minutes it did settle back to a thin cap with a bit of lacing left behind. This ale is a dark brown that is somewhat orange when held up to the light. This beer is clear, so I can observe the moderate carbonation cascade up.
The aroma is light bready malts.
The flavor starts with a crispness up front, the light hops, giving way to sweet caramel malt flavor.
The feel is light, a bit thin.
This is an easy one to drink, the flavor is ok, the feel is light. I wish I would have one of the originals to see what all the fuss is about! !",3.47
Newcastle Brown Ale,"This is not Newcastle brown! Please alter the name as you have completely altered and ruined my favorite brown ale! Because you have done this I will not be drinking Brown Sugga,Pilsner, lil Sumpthin, or any beer offered as a Lagunitas product. Thanks for somewhat destroying a part of my beer experience!",2.54
Newcastle Brown Ale,"This is not Newcastle Brown. Have some respect for a brand that has been around since 1927. Awesome, you own it now, Langunitas. Free enterprise at it's finest but if you're going to completely change the recipe at least have the decency to change or at least alter the name to 2.0 or remix or something. To all of the basically kids that are giving the lol to people like me, you just don't get it. I've been drinking Newcastle since the early 90's. You may as well hand me a bud light and say ""here's your newkey"". NO IT'S NOT. This is not about whether or not this beer is any good. If you like it then fantastic. The point is you can't just fancy up the label and call it the same thing. Have some respect for the brand. I personally will not buy another Langunitas product again and that's my choice. Rant complete.",2.0
Péché Mortel,"Solid black appearance with a thin tan head.
Has light carbonation thick heavy feel to the body.
Aroma is a deep rich smokey,char, dark bakers chocolate, coffee grinds.
Taste has a harsh but pleasant coffee bitterness, dry dark chocolate, roasted malt with some smokey wood.
Overall an excellent beer",4.5
Péché Mortel,"Poured nicely.
Very noticeable coffee smell.
Too much. Doesn't taste like beer with coffee, tastes like coffee with carbonation. Overpowering.
Not to my liking.",3.75
Péché Mortel,"A magnificent stout with a bold in-your-face roasted coffee flavor. Poured from a twelve ounce bottle dated 2019.

Body poured bible black with initial head that receded to a thin ring around the edge during the tasting.

The nose is roasted coffee with chocolate flavor expressed from the malts. Very pleasing.

The body follows the nose but adds a significant bitterness. Chocolate malts and char arrive with the bitterness than all fade to a dry finish.

Mouthfeel is good though a bit thin for my expectations of a stout of high ABV. The powerful flavor more than compensates.

Coffee fans must track this beer down. You'll thank me later.",4.44
Péché Mortel,"Pours black. Aroma is best feature of this beer. Incredibly intense coffee aroma with equally intense dark chocolate & roasty, smokey char. Taste doesn't match aroma. Tastes like I'm drinking strong coffee. That's it. Mouthfeel is way too thin for me.",4.19
Péché Mortel,"Drinking this fucker walking through Modern Day McArthur Park..if you know you know . It's like the 90s all over again here

Dieu De Ciel - Peche Mortel
Imperial Stout with Coffee.
No bottle date
Not a fan of their label rework at all but it's what's inside that counts right

Drinking it out the bottle so forgive my notes.
Nose is alll roasted coffee goodness, cacao nibs, semi sweet chocolate and dark malts. A bit on the sweeter side .
As with all well made stouts taste follows nose with that big robust coffee flavor , semivsweet chocolate, cacao, dark fruit and big dark malt flavor that adds some sweetness (coffee balances this well cuz its not overpowering sweetness at all, very mild) .

Look: don't know.

Feel: as expected from non ba coffee stout. Lingers on the palate for a while and gives your teeth that 'drinking coffee' dry feel.

Overall : enjoyable no bullshit Coffee Stout.
Thanks @micada""",4.44
Péché Mortel,"Bottled on 1/27/2022. Poured into a stout glass at 59°. It pours nearly black with a half finger of creamy, toffee-colored head and lacing. It smells of freshly-brewed coffee, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco smoke, and nutty char. The coffee in the flavor is strong, burnt, and acidic. It combines with baker's chocolate, burnt nuts, and earthy char and is as dry and roasty as they come. There is just a hint of chocolate and caramel sweetness but this is a bitter brew. The flavors are big and bold and it finishes with a strong dose of hop bitterness. Delicious! The mouthfeel is creamy but not quite as viscous as I'd expected. It's moderately carbonated and isn't overly boozy for 9.5% ABV. Overall, this is the quintessential coffee stout. I'd recommend against drinking it before bed if you want to sleep. I don't know why Dieu du Ciel doesn't distribute to northern New Jersey but now that I can find it in South Jersey or eastern Penna. I'll be sure to stock up.",4.42
Péché Mortel,"A - Pitch black pour with toffee colored lacing.

S - Intense chocolate roast aroma with some char and deep coffee aroma.

T - Coffee roast, char, deep chocolate malt roast all up front and ends with a lingering chocolate roast/coffee bitterness.

M - Full silky body with some slight thinness around the edges and very dry on the back of the tongue.

O - This is a Classic and fantastic Imperial Stout that never gets old. Highly recommended.",4.31
Péché Mortel,"11.5 oz bottle notched 1 0 2 (my research shows this is a batch number and means nothing) poured into teku glass at fridge temp 9.5% ABV. The beer pours dense very dark brown with just a hint of light penetration around the edges. The head (or lack thereof) never fully develops and presents as the finest, razor thin ring around the glass. No lacing. The aroma is moderate in strength featuring coffee and a hint of booze. The taste is bittersweet coffee, chocolate and slight oxidation. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with less than medium carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, there's not a lot of life left in this bottle. I wish this beer was still imported. I would try fresh given the opportunity. Scores are skewed up as this bottle was just purchased off a room temperature shelf this week and has clearly suffered.",4.25
Péché Mortel,"11.5 oz bottle, born on 9/18/19, poured into a snifter at 52 degrees F:
L - black with a hazelnut head that lingered
S - coffee, chocolate, roasted malt
T - very dry, malt flavor with coffee and a bit of chocolate on the finish
F - thick mouthfeel, very dry, little carbonation
O - Fabulous beer, very dry with strong bold flavors of coffee and roasted malt",4.56
Péché Mortel,"Taste of dark roasted coffee is up front along with roasted malts that have a burnt-toasted character and a nice bitterness that lingers, but not too long. Nice imperial stout.",4.25
Péché Mortel,"341 ml bottle, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 9.5%. Black colour, moderate tan head. Aroma of coffee, roast malts and dark chocolate. Rich flavour, but not too sweet, notes of roast malts and strong coffee, also plenty of bittering hops. Hints of dark bitter chocolate and unsweetened liquorice. Good beer, but not as outstanding as expected.",3.89
Péché Mortel,"WOW. This beer is really something special.
Looks like any other deep black imperial stout does. Beautiful black in colour with small brown head, leaves some lacing.
Smells like roasted malt with some subtle dark roast coffee. Very inviting.
The taste of this beer is amazing. Nice roasted malt, caramel malt, coffee, and some vanilla maybe in the back. Some chocolate notes and brown sugar are present as well and it's all very well balanced. I didn't notice any of the fruit notes other people have reported. I drank the bottle in like 2 minutes without even noticing so this is definitely a dangerous drinker.
The mouthfeel was quite pleasant and full bodied. Doesn't coat the mouth but has that medium-full body with light-medium carbonation.
Overall at $14 for 4 bottles this beer is insane. This is the best overall Canadian beer I've ever found and I love Dieu du Ciel. Such a great beer and huge recommend for anyone with access to it.",4.84
Péché Mortel,"Appearance: Very dark brown bordering on black with a generous-sized foamy dark beige head that slowly faded. A very good looking Imperial Stout.

Smell: Roasted malts, moderate coffee and some very mild brown sugar notes. The coffee and the roasted malts are the star here.

Taste: The taste profile features prominent coffee and roasted malt notes, and some very faint brown sugar notes. The finish is fairly dry featuring the roast malts and coffee notes lingering to the end. The beer has a mild alcohol presence.

Mouth-feel: Medium bodied with a generous level of carbonation. Not the thickest stout but it still has a good mouthfeel.

Overall: A good coffee stout. The flavor profile is that of a prototypical stout with a real roasted malt backbone plus a nice coffee presence. A good pastry stout is tasty but sometimes it's good to go back to the basics.",4.32
Péché Mortel,"Purchased based on a rave review from Foss Co. in Golden, an accolade to take very seriously. Still, at $5/12 oz I wasn't expecting something quite this ... exceptional. By appearance it's an average imperial stout, jet black with a thin tan head, but oh wow. The reviewer who called it ""something like hard cold brew"" pretty much nailed it. Delicately chocolaty and dark fruity, with a seamlessly integrated bitterness upon a clean but comforting body. An elegant palette of bold and beautiful flavors that never overstay their welcome. (By the way, hard cold brew does exist, and it's disgusting.)",4.7
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"650 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 11.0%. Pitch black colour, moderate creamy tan head. Intense aroma of cocoa / chocolate. The flavour has also loads of chocolate and cocoa, but the sweetness is not too extreme. Also some roasted coffee notes. A moderate hoppy bitterness in the finish (Chinook and Willamette) balances some of the chocolate sweetness. Very drinkable for an 11% beer. I had no problem finishing the bottle - but if you hate chocolate, this is clearly not a beer for you.",4.05
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"I've had many opportunities to drink Choklat Oranj and really liked it. Had this one for a few years and thought a snowy Christmas would be a good time to drink it. Really hits the spot. I guess it could be a dessert beer but when its freezing outside and the snow is blowing it'll do. Looks like motor oil with very little head. Just like an imperial stout should. With my diminished sense of smell I get chocolate (imagine that) and malt. Can't decide if its milk chocolate, bittersweet or what but definitely chocolate. Taste is the star here. Chocolate of course but I don't think its too sweet. Nice clean finish I could drink it for dessert but it's fine in front of the fire in the dead of winter. Mouthfeel is almost perfect. Slightly thick, smooth as silk and just about right. Overall, a really good imperial stout. Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be available any longer but should it pop up again i'm definitely getting another bottle or two",4.44
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"22oz bottle. No dating information found.
Black colored body, with ruby back lit highlights. Two fingers of tan head settles back to bubbly cap. Leaves very little lacing.
Aroma is similar to a chocolate malt. Smells very sweet.
Taste is sweet but also bittersweet, and with a little smoky char. Displays many types of chocolate, from sweet milk chocolate to bitter dark chocolate. Roasted malts are there for support.
Mouth feel is about medium, but the texture is more rich and with slight syrup. Good carbonation.
This is a beer made to display many forms and textures of chocolate, fudge to syrup to milk chocolate balls to bittersweet. Ultimately sweet and best suited for a dessert experience.",4.25
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"Pours a brown so deep it appears to be shoe polish black. Garnet colored when bright light is passed through it. The pour produces a strong finger of foamy, moderately lasting, mocha head that leaves a rounded surface cap, a respectable collar ring and a pasty wash of lace 1/2 inch above the collar. The presentation is above average for a higher octane Imperial Stouts. Aroma is chocolate, chocolate, chocolate... deeply roasted malts, with hints of toffee, spice, prunes and a little alcohol booze. Taste is even more chocolate. Rich dark chocolate, Hershey's chocolate syrup, chocolate chip cookie dough, chocolate pudding, vanilla (like Oreos and milk), something nutmeg-like and alcohol spice. Puts me in mind of a deeply chocolate eggnog (if there is such a thing). There is little alcohol booze (for the ABV) and a faint hint of dark fruit. Velvety smooth in the finish it has almost no prickle between the finish and aftertaste but the hint is there. The aftertaste is earthy, chocolate, slightly bitter, roasted and burnt. Alcohol is evident as spice, warmth, flavor and maybe bitterness. Mouthfeel is heavy bodied with low-moderate carbonation, smooth... velvety smooth, tongue coating creamy and chewy with a very thin peppery prickle.",4.48
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"Christmas Eve snowfall, a fireplace and Santa bringing me a case of Southern Tier Choklat. I'm set for the winter. Great velvety feel, pours almost black. But the aroma and taste are the stars here. First, they line up. None of this smells like one thing and tastes like another. The chocolate coffee balance is perfect. At 10%abv you should be sipping this beer and frankly no matter what the abv, this beer deserves to be enjoyed slowly. Alexa. Play ""The Christmas Song"" by Nat King Cole. And tell Santa to make that two cases of Choklat.",4.8
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"Look: It pours black with a dark brown head. Head retention is moderate.

Smell: The initial aroma is a strong deep dark chocolate aroma. It reminds me of a brownie as it warms a bit.

Taste: This has a rich malt flavor with dark chocolate and cocoa. There is some roast and some slight burnt flavors. There is a bit of cherry in the background as well. Dark fruits are very low.

Feel: It has a rich, velvet like texture that is smooth and creamy. It has a moderate amount of bitterness to it.

Overall, it is a very rich, chocolate beer. The dark chocolate is the dominate flavor of the beer with some supporting elements in the background.",4.2
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"A: poured from a 22 oz bottle dated 12/28/13 into a pint glass, dark brown almost black with a large tan head that lingers leaving good lacing, clear

T: sweet chocolate, vanilla, milk shake, toffee, slight coffee, dark and roasted malt

M: thick and rich

O: excellent chocolate imperial stout",4.31
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"As a rule, I don't drink Stouts, but my wife does and I tasted hers. This was a great beer! The main thing that got me was the taste and mouthfeel. I could taste Chocolate and Cherry with good body, and there was no lingering aftertaste that I have found with most Stouts. We were visiting in South Carolina. Wish it and their Chocolate Orange Stout was available here in Virginia.",4.5
Choklat (Blackwater Series),"This is a delicious dessert beer. Roasty coffee mixes in with a chocolate pudding sort of flavor. The beer is somewhat creamy with plenty of chocolate. Really good stuff, but a little heavy. Probably best to share or drink slowly. Not hot, just really rich.",4.18
Red's Rye IPA,"On tap at founders

Pours an amber red with a one finger foamy white head. Smells of Caramel and biscuity malt, peppery rye, pine and citrus peel. Malty up front with caramel Notre, mid palate gives citrus zest and pine resin. The finish gives some malty sweetness with a citrus linger. Medium body with moderate carbonation, foamy mouthfeel and finish",4.18
Red's Rye IPA,"Astounded that I have not reviewed this yet. It is the single beer that I have never fell out of favor with. Others come and go as tastes change but this one always hits the sweet spot for me.
Pours a lovely burnished red and sports a manilla colored head for a little while.
The aroma is hoppy and malty and just an ideal combination of these.
The taste is where this really shines. Crisp is the word- such a balanced layering of flavors from spices to caramel to citrus and a refreshing bitterness to finish the sip.
The feel is ideal for the style, I am not sure it can be improved.
OA, it’s always on draft around W Michigan which is good as they seldom bottle or can it as it looses flavor quickly. Or so they say. I’d rather drink an older container of this than not drink it at all.
Really good beer!",4.57
Red's Rye IPA,"Pretty good rye IPA. Dark amber color with ample white head. Rye flavored IPA with nice flavor profile and few off-putting flavors. Overall eminently drinkable—not too bitter for an IPA, not too sweet. Well rounded and well crafted.",4.04
Red's Rye IPA,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 6.6%, 70 IBUs. Reddish brown colour, big and lasting off-white head. Nice aroma of floral and citrussy hops (dry hopped with Amarillo), also sweetish notes of caramel and orange marmalade. The flavour has also notes of orange marmalade and caramel malts, but is not extremely sweet. There is a distinct hoppy bitterness towards the end, with grapefruity and resinous notes, lasting through the long aftertaste. Good stuff.",3.75
Red's Rye IPA,Pours a medium-dark copper color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma is sweet with a hint of caramel. Tastes starts out slightly spicy and finishes with a good hoppy bitterness. Good mouth feel.,4.12
Red's Rye IPA,"This is my all time favorite beer, not necessarily because it's the best beer I've ever had, but for many reasons including sentimental ones, so I will try to view this as objectively as I can.

Poured from a Michigan exclusive release can into an IPA glass.

Color is deep caramel/red tones. Head is darker than a typical IPA and sticks to the glass like glue

Smell is peppery and malty, slightly sweet. Pleasant, not overly intrusive.

Taste follows the nose but much, much stronger. Peppery bite up front, followed by the sweet from the red ale characteristics. Finish is a lingering rye pepper flavor. Excellent and memorable.

Medium bodied, smoother than you would expect mouthfeel.

Overall, this is a delicious beer that is also interesting to drink. I'm so glad that they are packaging this beer again after a long hiatus, and consider myself lucky to be a Michigan native so that I can get this beer easily.",4.58
Red's Rye IPA,"12oz can courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the can, this was canned on ""03.09. 200019034."" Apparently, Founders has an in-house time machine, and this beer was retrieved from the era the Dune books are set in.

Poured into a Mad Bomber IPA glass, this had a nice, but, fluffy, beige colored head that sat on top of a dark copper, slightly red colored beer with some nice clarity. Said head took a long time to drop and left lots of lace behind.

Peppery, spicy Amarillo hop and rye malt notes greeted the workers at my olfactory. Some sweet, bready malt notes as well.

Taste is spicy and peppery up front. Earthy, Rye malt flavor comes to the fore especially at the fadeout. Fairly good-sized, bready malt backbone to this, which isn't surprising given it's midwest DNA, but is not sufficiently massive to be disturbing to a PNWer like me!

Medium bodied, with an almost creamy mouthfeel.

Really like this. If it were local to me I'd have it in my fridge on a regular basis. Thanks, Whyteboar!",4.27
Red's Rye IPA,"From old, undated notes. Had this on draft.

Red's Rye IPA,"Now I'm trying to figure out a blind tasting, courtesy of a @foundersasap in our NBS BIF #9

I am a little baffled by this one.
It's a garnet tinged amber color. Light sandy head that rises a finger or so, loosens up, and quickly recedes. (I'm assuming it would have a little more head retention had I opened earlier).
Really pretty color.
Smells of rye, some earthy hops, and a hint of caramel malt.
Taste is rye, buckwheat, a tad of pine resin, with a gentle almost floral honey note. Also a smooth pepper note peeks in.
Mouthfeel is slightly less than medium. Low carbonation. Finish is a tad slick.
Overall, I'm guessing a rye IPA, or an Amber ale with some rye in the mix.
So what is it?",3.92
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"12 fl. oz. bottle, thanks to my son Steinar. ABV is 7.2%. Cloudy dark brown colour, big and creamy tan head. Very nice aroma of fruity American hops and oak, blackcurrants, marmelade, some vinous notes too. The mouthfeel is first soft and creamy and the flavour is first fruity smooth and alluring, then a treacherous and distinct hoppy bitterness sets in, accompanied by oaky and smoky notes. Very bitter aftertaste. An ""arrogant"" beer, perhaps - but not quite as arrogant as I feared. I am worthy!",3.95
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a reddish brown from the 22 ounce bottle, excellent clarity. Off white, foamy head that was generous and lasted for a time before reducing to a nice, foamy cap.

The smell is not as aggressive as anticipated. I get a sweet impression - caramel/toffee and sweet dark fruits - raisin/fig maybe date. There's enough resinous pine to give a promise of a hefty bitterness, but there are also softer floral notes, an earthiness, a very slight citrus zest. The malts weigh in with biscuits and toast. Spicy like cloves.

The taste delivers on what's promised by the smell. Caramel and toffee lead followed by sweet dark fruit. This rides on the back of the toast and biscuit flavors. Then other flavors come along - a woodiness from the oak, floral, earthy, definite citrus zest resembling orange, and big but not unpleasant sharp bitterness. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. While it could be jagged, everything comes together for a smooth experience.

Everything lingers into the aftertaste. It's got a nice, sticky feel without being overly cloying. Carbonation seems medium and appropriate for this beer. Smooth and creamy. Oddly the beer ""feels good"".

Overall, this was a smooth-drinking flavor bomb. Layered and integrated very nicely even with the substantial kick of bitterness. Well done.",4.18
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"From notes 1/25/12: Pours a rich but murky brown with a reddish tint. Develops a 1.5 inch, frothy, tan, moderately lasting head that leaves nice clumpy lacing. Aroma is resinous pine hops, oaky vanilla, dark malt roast and a hint of toffee. Taste is piney hops up front and woody vanilla with hints of toffee and caramel. The ""oaking"" process does something that greatly subdues the fig, prune, molasses bread and fruitcake flavors found in Arrogant Bastard original. Starts hoppy and bittersweet but immediately increases in bitterness to finish dry and quite bitter. The bitterness lingers long in the aftertaste.",4.34
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"**
06/01/2013

Aroma is pure hops and barley. Dark copper color, but translucent. Small white head. Thin feel. Low carbonation. A bit too strong and bitter, though I think the oaked version of this beer us a touch smoother than the original. Some good flavors, but all over the place. The pieces don’t come together here.

**",2.86
OAKED Arrogant Bastard Ale,"A- Probably the best write up anyone will come across on a beer bottle haha!! This pours with a great caramel colored head that is dense, starts off about a finger thick and has awesome retention. The beverage itself is muddied, brown and with plenty of visible suspended yeast particulate. The carbonation seems to be plentiful and smooth. As for lacing, it is really nice, with lots of small circular clumps of foam stickily hanging on to the side of the glass.

S- First impression.....wood chips, and of campfire! Beyond this there is vanilla, slight coffee and chocolate notes, some dense dried apple, caramel and toffee sweet malts and the finish is rummy sweet yet bitter from the hops....a very nice balancing act between rich & malty, oak, and bitter.

T- The flavors follow suit to the aromas, with the richness of the rum coming through very well....almost liqueur like. I am getting beautiful caramel/toffee sweetness, vanilla, oak cask, some campfire smoke. The bulk of the beer is yeasty, bread like, of cream, nuttiness.....just a full spectrum of balanced goodness!

M/O- Mouthfeel is creamy medium/full bodied, and the carbonation is about as smooth as one can get! I give this full marks for drinkability and I'd love nothing more than to enjoy more than one of these delectable Ales.....the alcohol is so well hidden you don't even know there is any.....what a delight to drink! Simply awesome and worthy of being one of my favorite beers!",4.6

Ruthless Rye IPA,"Poured from a Sierra Nevada sampler 12-pack glass bottle into a flared-lip tulip/IPA-style custom drinking glass. Very thick white head that stayed resilient for a short while. You can taste the rye backing up the hops with this one. Has a slightly different bitter background other than hops. Finishes less dry than other IPA's. Has a mild sweetness that blends well. The nose is more prominent than other in this sampler pack. Almost rustic; sweet, pleasant and malty. A darker color than usual IPA's, as to be expected with the rye. A brown color, almost like an amber beer was mixed with 1/4th west coast ipa. In the nucleated glass I poured it into, its maintained persistent carbonation bubbles rising to the top. More so than a lot of other IPA's to an extent. Not overly carbonated though. Maintains a thin, but thicker than usual lacing even minutes later. A good amount of carbonation, maybe the slightly higher end but still in a good way, as per usual with most Sierra Nevada beer's I've tried so far.

Overall a tasty beer and a nice experience, coming from someone new to rye beers.",3.64

Aromas of bready malt, toasted rye, and hints of citrus.

The flavor carries a wide variety of notes. Bready malt, toasted rye, floral, and citrus all show up until the finish, where the piney hops arrive.

The mouthfeel is down the middle medium, and rather slick, with carbonation lacking.

S: Aromas of mocha, caramel, cocoa, molasses, and light pine.
T: Semisweet. The palate certainly follow the nose, but the caramel/molasses maltiness and piney core is now front and center. Solid bitterness.

Trois Pistoles,"Dark walnut brown, reddish when light shines through. Tall head with good retention and some lacing. Lots of malty aroma.

Trois Pistoles,"Trois Pistoles pours a ruby red so dark as to be almost black with a thick off-white head that lasts forever.

The aroma brings to mind dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and strawberry jam, with a hint of dark chocolate underneath.

The flavour brings across all those dark fruit notes with just a hint of sweetness, and introduces the dark chocolate notes on the finish. There's a layered complexity and balance to the flavours that I only find in exceptional Belgian beers.

The carbonation is effervescent and gives the beer a really rich, decadent mouth feel. The 9% alcohol is very well hidden.

This is a truly fantastic beer! An awesome Belgian Dark ale, I think it compares very favourably against Quadruples as well. This is one of the tastiest, most complex and well balanced Belgians I've had, and everyone I've introduced this beer to has come away impressed. Unibroue has really outdone themselves here.",4.76

Brewers Notes: Drawing on Quebec folklore, Unibroue chose the name Trois Pistoles to honour the city’s historic importance and pay homage to the legend of the Black Horse. Conjured up by a priest to help build a new church, this incarnation of the devil ran off when its bridle was removed. Because construction was still underway when the horse vanished, a stone remains missing from the church to this day.

Trois Pistoles,"I bought this for the Trippel tasting weekend, not sure why, but here we are. Obviously rating as a Belgian style Dark Ale.
Poured dark, like reddish cola and managed to get about 5 mm of head of beige foam which pretty much stayed the whole time.
The aroma was more dark fruits like raisins and prunes; not sweet at all, very pleasant.
The taste followed, mouth-filling flavor of malty goodness.
The feel was almost viscous, which considering all the flavor and the ABV, it made perfect sense. Excellent sipper.
This one turned out to be a happy mistake, I'll definitely revisit it on purpose.",4.49
Trois Pistoles,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a New Belgium Globe Glass

Pours a murky dark mahogany color with some reddish hues, and a medium tan head that recedes quickly leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is sweet; consisting of cherries, raisins, dates, brown sugar, a mild spiciness, and a pronounced booziness.

The flavor follows the nose closely, with a mix raisins, plums, cherries, brown sugar, molasses, and a hint of spiciness. Also, as with the nose, there is a strong booziness, but not overly strong, just enough to alert you to the 9% abv. Full bodied and moderately carbonated.

Overall, this is a very nice beer that I will be revisiting",4.36
Trois Pistoles,"Pours a cloudy, very dark brown with a finger thick head of tightly packed bubbles.

As with many of Unibroue’s offerings, they have a hallmark style with their Belgians — leans fruity, and leans on the subtler yet complex side of things. This is no different. Complex nose that is hard to pick apart the malty side, spiced fruitcake, gentle cloves, fresh dark fruits like cherry. Molasses and toffee.

Flavour follows the nose pretty tightly. Alcohol is well hidden but the warmth it has adds a dimension to the flavour profile, a woody sherry like flavour. More malt here than on the nose, especially on the finish which recalls toasted bread and spongy chocolate coffered toffee and sugared apples. Bits of yeastiness wax and wane throughout your palate as you sip it.

Incredible mouthfeel. It foams very, very hard in your mouth but the carbonation is not particularly prickly. This gives it a very foamy mouthfeel on the way down. Medium bodied beer that is relatively sweet, no real bitterness here. Medium-high level of carbonation, especially noticeable in that sip, but the carbonation is not overly biting. Nice subtle but long finish leaving a gentle sweetness, yeasty grains, and dark fruits on the palate.

As mentioned before, I find almost all of Unibroue’s offerings to be milder on the flavour strength than Belgian styles from Belgium itself. That doesn’t make it bad, but they lean towards a more mild and complex flavour profile. They also tend to be more fruity than malty, and that is the case here. They write that rum flavours abound in the nose and palate, my experience has been with the fruity side of the beer it has a strong port or sherry side rather than rum, but you can get a rum taste. It’s just not as strong as other Belgian styles or malty Eisbocks.

Overall it’s quite a formidable beer, just as good as anything out of Belgium, while carving out its own unique niche and noticeable flavour profile on its own. At the same time, mild enough to be enjoyed by any beer drinker, even though new to the style. Unibroue really does not tend to miss on any of their beers",4.23

Trois Pistoles,"A real beauty to look at, from the dark brown body to the large, lasting tan head to the graceful lace. Layers of rich malts in the aroma where you can pick out dark fruit, pitted fruit, molasses, brown bread and probably a few other favorite descriptors. Just don't count on too many hop varieties. Taste leans the same way although the hops come into play a bit more. Spiciness is more noticeable, especially in the aftertaste. Sweetness is a factor while bitterness is minimal.

This pours a gorgeous deep brown with tons of fine foamy head. The aroma is subdued (my beer is warming), but appetizing and a bit boozy. The taste is delicious malts and yeast. I don't think this sample is very old, but this style would age well. I should get a sixer and put some up.

Recommended. I will be happy to have this again some time - it is a nice and easy version of the style while not being phony or wimpy.",4.04

T: sweet and thick are the dominant characteristics. More dark fruit, cherry and raisin. Bitter/sharp on the back end that can make it feel not as heavy as it really is.

F: medium-full bodied. A nice level of carbonation.

O: close in profile to Belgian darks. Has some interesting qualities of fruit and tartness but still doesn’t top actually Belgian’s to me. Still very good.",4.14
Rouge (Red),"Popped a big thick 750mL tall brown bottle. Deep amber to the browner end of copper, it pours hazy with yeast and unfiltered goodness and a foamy two and a half finger head that recedes into a spotty cap with thick, clinging ring of foam around the glass. Large bubbles pop up, not in a line, just one by one, from the ethereal dark brown bottom.

Malty, sweet, caramel, yeasty esters on the nose are primary. Doughy and bready, and you’d be forgiven for smelling banana. Particularly good amount of spices, cloves and cinnamon. Little bit peppery but the general character stays to the sweet side and reminds mostly of that.

Flavourful and pleasantly balanced profile, not as strong as their other beers. This can easily be a plus or a minus depending on what you want from your beers. Deep savoury yeasty esters that border on doughy but are more restrained interact with the sweet caramel malt and gentle toasty flavours that never border on cloying. Clove and peppery spices present here. As for fruits, I get a lot less dark fruits than others do. Plum and raisin might be present, but they taste fresh and gentle, and banana is just as present. Maybe it’s the foamy carbonation giving it a lighter touch on my palate or something else. The alcohol is well hidden which likely adds to the lighter character that gives a more spicy-light phenolic touch that leans towards lighter flavours rather than deep raisiny-fig-pudding ones. Definitely some molasses here though.

Medium-ish bodied with a higher level of carbonation, the finish is barely touched by any hops or buttering presence and is lightly sweet, again, not cloying. Bready malts with a touch of yeastiness stays on the palate, and mild spice character reminds, the light pepper impression of white peppercorn and the sweetness and spice of cinnamon, light vanilla, and currants. The good carbonation level and tendency to highly foam when it hits your tongue gives the taste palate a unique spin that is a bit lighter and very nice, it’s not quite creamy or smooth but sort of a merge between them both. I chalk it up to the great way this beer blends palates and tastes.

Ah dubbels, the interesting beer that’s not between, but occupies little spaces between a doppelbocks, Belgian strong dark ales, and Tripels. Hard for me to localize how it fits, and my palate is unrefined, but I try! Chimay Red mixes things together that arguably comes out in a perfect cohesive blend. What can I say? I love malt, sweet, spicy beers. Definitely an excellent offering from Chimay, their Blue still my favourite, but this is as good or potentially better than white? Have to try both again. All the Trappist beers are just delightful, and the yeast is great for my stomach. Excellent beer to round out my 100th review!",4.31
Rouge (Red),"L - Shared a 12 oz bottle poured into a Dogfish Head Signature glass. Dark brown thick light tan head on aggressive pour. Minimal lacing. Has alcohol legs

S - Sweet and buttery. Dark fruits. Maybe Mulled wine or after dinner wine in there. There is a caramel scent in it too.

T - Taste follows scent with sweetness and dark fruits. Fig, plum, and possibly banana. Some booziness in the taste. No bitterness at all. There is a malty caramel or toffee that shows up as it warms up.

F - Good carbonation and cola consistency that smooths out as you drink

O - Overall, this is a fantastic beer. Very drinkable with no bitterness (a little booziness) and a lot of flavor. After trying Chimay Blue, White, and Red, I enjoyed this Red a lot.

Chimay Blue is a god-tier beer. Red is one that is not quite as acclaimed, but if it matches the quality of Blue I will be very impressed. Also, despite my love for Belgian beers, I have not had very many Dubbels, though I thoroughly enjoyed the one’s I’ve had. Let’s see if this legend lives up to the hype

Pours a murky mahogany color with 3 fingers of creamy off white head that very slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here is beautiful balanced with the dark fruit and subtle spice complementing the chewy malt. I’m picking up on aromas of gold raisin, fig, dark toffee, allspice, brown bread, clove, and a hint of caramel

This focuses on the malt way more heavily in flavor, but works in its advantage. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting raisin, sticky toffee, brown bread, light black cherry, and white pepper. The swallow brings notes of sweet black cherry, clove, doughy malt, light vanilla, molasses, and caramel

A medium full body pairs with very gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth and luxuriously creamy beer. Finishes mostly dry with a wonderful sweetness

Well, after having KBBS, the highest rated beer in the world and a heavily adjuncted Stout for review 1000, I figure a classic, no frills Stout is the logical next step. I’ve never had this one fresh, but I’m excited to try it regardless, especially for the Cellaruary thread. Let’s get into it

Pours a muddy dark brown with a finger of tan head that immediately fades to a thin ring and leaves minimal lacing

It is pretty wild the complexity a Stout can have without barrel aging; everything speaks for itself without any distraction. I'm picking up on aromas of cocoa powder, raisin, dark toast, toffee, earthy bourbon, light roast coffee, and charred oak

I know the age and abv definitely play a role in bumping up the complexity and robustness of this beer, but it's an impressive thing regardless. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting dark chocolate, black cherry, caramel, charred malt, dark bready malt, bourbon, light raisin, and a touch of red wine. The swallow brings notes of cocoa powder, rich red wine, charred malt, toffee, black cherry, and a touch of acidic coffee

A full body pairs with very gentle carbonation resulting in a somewhat hot beer. Finishes off dry with a lightly tart fruitiness

This is solid stuff right here. I really can't believe I waited this long to try it. A far cry from the KBBS I had yesterday for review 1000, but a wonderful beer in its own right. Hopefully I can get a fresher bottle next time",4.24

T - Follows the nose, with a fat malty open, chocolate and dark fruits, vanilla and a subtly bitter finish.

Almost black, cola edge, not much (if any) foam to speak of, smells like coffee beans, hops, and paint varnish.

If I can describe the taste in cave-man terms - ""chocolate sweet, malty, then bitter coffee alcohol burn"".

This is a big, thick, chewy beer, and it hides the 18% astonishingly well, actually able to fold the ""woody"" alcohol flavor back into the rest of the attack on your taste buds: coffee, chocolate, honey, and all the sweet malt duking it out on the sweet/bitter battlewargrounds, making a mess all over your tastebuds",3.26
World Wide Stout,"Poured from the 12oz bottle into an imperial pint glass. The date on the bottle reads 09/22/16 - 4.5 years old.

A: The beer is pure black with a brown head that surprisingly built up to about 1.5 foamy fingers and stuck around a bit. No light coming through at all, even directly to light. A serious looking beer.

S: A lot going on here, but much of it is kind of buried beneath a strong, hot boozy aroma. Bourbon and port mostly. Dark fruits like plum and raisin, medicinal cherry. A hint of vanilla, roasted malt. This is a complex aroma, but a bit heavy on the alcohol.

T: Vanilla, roasted character. Dark fruit in the mid-palate. Finishes very heavy on the port alcohol character. Hard to unpack a lot of the flavors in here due to the heavy alcohol content.

F: A bit oily and coating, but burns a bit going down and when held in the mouth.

Overall: There is a lot of good in here, but it is buried under a ton of alcohol. On an experimental level, that's kind of the point, and I'd like to revisit this after a few more years to see how that continues to mellow out. This was a good experience, a lot to unpack, but really a one off for me unless I can find a really old one, and cheaply.",4.07
Devil Dancer,"12oz bottle courtesy of Whyteboar. According to the stamp on the rear label, this was bottled on January 16, 2020. Perhaps not ideal for a normal IPA, but as the same rear label makes clear, this ain't no normal IPA, as it clocks in at a fierce 12% abv!

Poured into a tulip-shaped hybrid glass (don't know what else to call it), this was a dark amber color, taking on a rubyish hue when held up to light. About an inch or so of beige colored foam was present as head, and left a decent amount of lace for such a strong beer.

Nose was of herbal grassy hops, bready malts, plus a little bit of band aid type aroma. As it warms, it gets a bit boozy.

More promising in the flavor department than in the nose. Grapefruity, piney, peppery and bready - this is a big beer that makes a big impact on the taste buds. Quite a bit of alcohol ""heat"" is present. Unsurprisingly, for a triple IPA from the midwest, there's a massive malt backbone, so for the hops to stand out as much as they do, there must have been an ungodly amount used.

Medium to full body, with a coating, resiny, almost syrupy mouthfeel.

This is a beast! I imagine this is a beer that is very expensive to make, and get why it's not widely distributed at this point.

Devil Dancer,"Appearance:
Pours the color dark wildflower honey, a deep amber with sunny hues of orange.

Bouquet:
Syrupy sweet hops, mango, citrus, and pleasing, earthy yeast after-notes.

Full-bodied. Satiny molasses with a bubbly bite. The treacle-like qualities don't overstay their welcome, but the bright, effervescence lingers like a miniature fireworks display, as its tickling bubbles burst brilliantly in all corners of the mouth. The contrast is delightful.

Devil Dancer,"Boy this one’s good. Whew. Powerful and strong yet flavorful and clean. So-called “triple” IPA obtained fresh from Founders via growler. Purchased on 9/6/19. Start off only decent, pours a honeyed medium amber color with a little white head that quickly settled to a thin film. Also just a little scarce spotty lingering lacing. Even with a rocky pour, the fluffy white head had settled quickly. The aromas, however, were just incredible. Beautiful fruity hops of mango, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, passionfruit, guava and lemon. Also some nice malt, floral and herbal hops, bread, caramel and a little dankness. Taste follows the nose, very rich and flavorful with good balance. The strong hit of hoppy bitterness was well offset by the sweeter malt backbone that had a good presence. Mouthfeel was excellent, sticky, slightly luscious, smooth and coated the palate. Good amount of carbonation. This was definitely a sipper, the higher ABV was quite present even with the beer cold, but I enjoyed it thoroughly. I’m happy that Founders brought this one out of retirement to serve it on tap at their brewery.",4.22
Devil Dancer,"Look: Oooooh. Almost brown-orange. Easily the prettiest of the four IPAs I ordered as a flight at the Founders brewery. Persistent lacing and continuous bubbles.

Smell: It smells wet, the way that yeasty Belgians can, but in a way that I know it's not actually going to taste like that. It's weird; honestly it smells a little ""off"", but the taste is fine.

Taste: Astringently hoppy (which I like),

Feel: tingly, foamy. Thick and resinous but so effervescent, so quite a contradiction in mouthfeel

Overall: compared against Founder's 12 Feet Under, I'd say I prefer 12 Feet Under. Maybe it's just because I have a fond place in my heart for things like Dogfish 120, or because barrell-aing anything is a great way to my heart. This is fine, and very hop forward, but doesn't have the depth of 12 Feet Under. Dogfish 120...12 Feet Under...120 Feet Under? I smell a collaboration in the future. Get on it, Founders!",3.92
Devil Dancer,"Bottle from the cellar. Bought in 2012. With a cabinet full of barley wines and belgian darks, this is a real standout. Low carb, low to no head. Deep copper/red color. Slight warmth. The aromas and taste of this one are why I put these beers away for years. Hats off, founders.",4.84
Devil Dancer,"Bottled 5/24/15; drank 6/28/15 @ the Yarchives.

Semi-opaque ruby red appearance.

A rough pour produced a nice tan head; nice lace.

Grapefruit, mango, booze heat & faint caramel notes in the nose.

Thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Caramel, raspberry & strawberry flavors up front; a brutally bitter, dry alcohol heat finish.

Good flavors lurk beneath a punishing finish. Too bad.",3.75
Devil Dancer,"Smell of butterscotch. Taste starts as butterscotch and slowly fades to nearly the taste of the last sip of a sweet bourbon Manhattan. Aftertaste sticks around for minutes. Perfect mouthfeel. I really enjoy this beer, and you should too!",4.34
Devil Dancer,"Note: bottle date 5/4/15

This bottle was pushed to the back of the collection and just unearthed.
Pours a clear reddish amber with a billowy head that slowly fades. Lots of malt and caramel on the nose. Very flavorful, lots of caramel, malt, butterscotch, ends with a clean bitterness. Boozy, 12% abv is obvious. Thick and syrupy, carbonation is still great after 2.5 years!
Overall this is a great triple IPA, aged well imo.

Overall...This is an excellent beer that I recommend highly. This is an excellent Imperial IPA that many should try and decide for themseves",4.06
Resin,"This is a thin but tall 12oz. can poured into the Six Point pint glass. This ale is somewhat hazy, has an orange glow, with medium carbonation, the head is white, one finger, that quickly surrendered to a thin solid cap.
The aroma is noticeable from a distance, a pleasant sweet citrus!, I am surprised that I can pick up a light bread malt under the citrus
The flavor is sweet orange citrus giving way to some pine hops that I am certain will bring you to pucker for a second. The bitterness does not overpower the sweetness for long allowing one to enjoy the ale.
This brew has a 9.1 ABV, but the alcohol is hidden perfectly behind the flavor, there is not an alcohol bite or any noticeable heat.
Resin is a pleasant surprise! I was certain it would be overly bitter with an alcohol burn. The bitterness is very much present, but does not destroy the great flavor of this DIPA!!",4.14

Resin,Pours a slightly cloudy dark gold orange with a big thick rocky persistent head. Great smell- resinous and almost a sharp bright piney character. Some citrus too. Sort of a rounded bitterness up front which persists throughout and lingers through the finish. Resinous and piney in the middle. A little bit of a caramel malt mixes in. Full bodied.

Notes via stream of consciousness: Here we have another beer that I'm sure I've reviewed before but somehow went missing. It's poured a hazy amber colored body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The aroma is resinous - duh! - piney, delicately citrusy, and lightly floral. On to the taste... very much the same. The malt is grainy and lightly biscuity. The hops are floral, a touch grassy, and fruity with apple, orange, lemon, and grapefruit. There's probably more there as well! It's got a solid bitterness at a listed 103 IBUs but it doesn't come off nearly as bitter given the amount of malt that's there. It's a very nice blend between sweetish and biscuity malt and a variety of hop notes. The alcohol is apparent but not overly clear, and in combination with the bitterness and a little bit of acidic ""hop bite"" it finishes mainly dry with some grassy, resinous, and floral hops lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp. All in all this is a solid kind of old school double IPA that shouldn't be ignored. There are bigger, brighter, and brasher IPAs out there but this is a feel good, fall back version. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that this bitch clocks in at a whopping 9.1% ABV so you should probably slate it for later in the night.

Resin,"Packaging-5/5- I'm going to talk about the packaging here for a second. This beer comes in a distinct thin bullet can with a powdery green tint and golden/rusty orange embroidered sign on the front. The design is great and it really does make this beer stand out from the others. It has a distinct classic and weathered look that's oddly memorable and visually represents what this beer is, or is trying to, perceive. Looks great.

L-Pours a lively one finger headed ale with a finger and a half head and a golden amber-ish color. Subtle bubbles are there as well.
S-Smells like a very well crafted standard imperial IPA. Malty front with some hints of butterscotch and molasses. Piney, and earthy hop resin is there. Also, in some way, I almost get a candy-like Sweet Tart aroma. Smells great.
T-Not bad on the flavor. Malty sweet upfront with a bitter bite at the end. Subdued enough to invite other flavors as well. There is definitely some mandarine orange here, with a hint of grapefruit.
F-A medium bodied, juicy mouthfeel with a dry and refreshing finish.
O-Quite the experience. From the can to the finish I enjoyed this beer thoroughly. It's hard to come by an imperial IPA that is made so well and is so drinkable. Glad I got to try this!",4.26
Resin,"Such a pretty, orange/rusty colour in the glass with a bright, white, persistent head.

This can is reasonably old so aroma is restrained. There's some caramel and pine and a little bit of orange peel.

The flavour though... Oh my, the flavour. This beer is proudly IPA, even with age on the can. There's piney, resinous notes, some diesel and dankness that has taken over from where I would have expected fruitbowl citrus in a younger beer, but it still tastes fantastic. It's no longer able to hide its alcohol but it's only adding to the pleasure of the newly evolved whole that this beer has become.

Can't wait to taste it fresh!

Cheers",4.31
Resin,"Looks fantastic for the style. Pours a beautiful, cloudy golden hue with a nice two finger white head which dissipates to leave a sticky white lace as it recedes. Smells fruity and hoppy. Slight citrus, pine, hops, and something l can't quite put my nose on, floral, but it's pleasant. I like it. Taste is slightly citrusy, floral, piny, hoppy. Great flavors that come togethet nicely, but a bit overcomplicated for my taste. Really love the unknown floral type flavor though. So faint, but it's there. Feel is great from start to finish. Medium carbonation turns slightly creamy towards the end. Overall, a fine brew that hides the 9.1% abv well. 10.99 for a sixer. Not terrible at all. Glad l grabbed em.",3.97
Resin,"slim can, best by Nov 14, 2021 (oops), into THAT! NE IPA snifter.

Juicy medium orange with a finger of head, no lacing as it recedes.

Aroma of pine, citrus, juicy yeast, spruce, and slight onion.

For being a month out of date, this is still tasting fantastic. Wonderful alcohol citrus notes all over the place, with some more tropical notes following. White grapefruit, mandarin orange, lychee, pineapple, peach, and mango all dance around some oily pine and circus peanut. I'm very impressed.

Feel is carbonated, juicy, slightly resinous but less than you'd think when considering the name, with well hidden alcohol.

Overall, really surprised I'm jamming this one. I thought it'd be a drain pour but there's still some life left and I really like what's here. This is probably my favorite Sixpoint IPA now. Gonna pick up a 6 pack when I encounter it again. Incredible stuff, very impressive. This is the Sixpoint of old times. Damn cheap too.

And the mouthfeel, its maybe not so bad now that I get used to it. Ooh. Do I have a new favorite? I calculated the Smell score from the average of the other scores. that's right, innit?

Resin,"From a slim, tall 12 oz. can into a Perfect Pint glass. Translucent orange color with thick creamy white foam head. Nose of piney hops. I guess resin refers to pine resin, and there’s a bit of that but it’s not a major component. Taste is typical of a good double IPA, lots of hop up front tempered by malt but not too sweet. Also, it’s not a hop bomb. What do we have here then? Perhaps a “well balanced DIPA.” Mouth is slightly viscous/creamy and crisply bubbly.

Overall: I really like this. It’s similar to my favorite DIPA, Dogfish Head’s 90 Minute IPA, but less sweet and possibly more enjoyable. I’ll have to do a head to head comparison sometime. Highly recommended.",4.19

Resin,"Best by Oct 1 -21 it says on the can bottom.
Golden amber and opaque but not hazy in the light, deeper amber in the shade. A tall sticky white head forms and slumps quickly to a dense ring with drapes of lace.
Smells of wildflowers and conifers supported by a doughy sweetness with hints of ginger and lemon zest.
The flavor is almost weak up front for such a big beer - no flood of tongue heavy sugar that warns of the heft.
Balance is the word - malt and hop bitterness blend well and while I know the 9% is there, the malt depth is as solid as the hop character. Rich, medium bodied caramel is spiced with grassy, piney hop acids and a nutty toasted grain thing goin on making this a tasty swallow-er not a sipper.
The finish is on the dry side with a hint of fruit.
I never like the marketing of beer with terms like ""dank"" and resin since there is nothing reminiscent of cannabis in this beer despite the remote family connection to the hop plant.

Miller Lite,"Poured from a 12oz can best by Oct 10 2022

On the pour a nearly 2 finger lightly fizzy head formed and left some surprisingly decent lacing. Body is a darker golden straw carbonation is high but fine.

Aroma is malty, adjuncty, and has a bit of that cheap lager funk to it. I want to say I can detect hops similar to a pilsner but it's definitely leaning more toward cheap AAL. Not great, but for the style it's pretty good.

Taste is similar to MHL. A bit too sweet but relatively clean and light apart from the adjunct. Not a lot of bitterness but there is a very light hint. Not offensive not great but way better than coors light. This is light enough that I can taste carbonic acid like in a seltzer.

Feel is carbonated, relatively dry and easy drinking. A bit bigger than your average light beer, and with a longer finish. Completely average and it does its job.

Miller Lite,"Why people would spend extra money to drink a can of carbonated water is beyond me. Because that is exactly what it tastes like.

Idk all the ingredient that are put in here BC Miller does not list them, but something tastes funky. You can taste the artificial syrup taste you get from cheap beer. So overall, carbonated water actually has a more pleasant taste than this.
Mouthfeel: None to speak of, just like water.

It's bitter up front and a little spicy somehow.  Then the bready malts are really strong.  It is also fruity the entire time.

It's a medium mouthfeel with a normal amount of carbonation.  The finish tastes like a pastry, both like bread and honey.

It's pretty damn good, not as exotic as the description promises (not a hint of saffron).  It's an interesting beer. I give it a 4.7 out of 6.",3.9

Midas Touch,"Opaque, deep amber appearance with a small head and very little lacing. Sweet, honeyish aroma with varying degrees of maltiness.

Midas Touch,"12 oz bottle from a mix-6, split with my wife and poured into a snifter. Aroma and flavor are white grape, dry honey, and surprisingly little alcohol for the 9% abv.

Midas Touch,"Figured it was time to give this beer a whirl.
This bottle is ancient indeed...6/28/19, so a little over a year old at this point. Poured into an Ommegang snifter.

Pours a surprisingly gold color (I expected burnt orange like a barleywine) with a fluffy creamy cap of 1 finger, receding to a mossy ring with lace built up on the sides.

Aroma is pleasantly fruity and bright with elements of grape and citrus, slight pineapple, slight melon. Everything is brighter than expected. I guess I should shift my focus.

Flavor is a bit wasted at this point with some oxidized hops in tow somewhere; trying to re-align, I spot some more vinous but still white grape-ish notes, some oak barrel, a little bit of muscat, some melon rind, white grapefruit, honey, chive, and a bit of cilantro or other fresh herb.

Feel is crisp and starchy, but has a nice sticky yet oaky barrel barrel presence. Alcohol presence is rather high but to be expected, though feels more along the lines of a 12%'er. Drying finish with that microfiber sponge feel.

Overall this beer isn't bad, and I should try to find it fresher to get a better picture of it. Dogfish Head continues to be the curator of off-centered shit and this is definitely one of those examples. I like it though, it's twisted and won't fit into any of your neat little polite food tray-sized niches.

Price paid : $3.69 / bottle
Would buy again : Probably, to try it fresher.",3.98
Midas Touch,"Bottled 1/22/20

Ancient ales, huh? My first one of the series, I didn't even realize they were doing a batch this year

Pours a lightly cloudy orange/gold with just a white cap that fizzles away to a ring of bubbles very fast and leaves no lacing

Quite the odd aroma here, I'm picking up a lot of different notes. There's an earthy, peppery spice carrying through, white grape, and raw honey all combine to make an odd but not bad scent

Oh yeah, that's a fuck ton of saffron in the taste, not really something you expect in a beer, even though this is brewed with it. The honey comes though strong in the beginning, sweet and unrefined, and only gets sweeter as the sip progresses. However, there are tart fruit notes to finish, mostly white grape, peach, and green apple. Oddly enough, the flavor reminds me of some strange nitro energy drink I had years ago that I think was supposed to be grape flavored and had some spice as well

Pretty light body and mild carbonation, this thing bounces back and forth between tart and sweet to keep things interesting. Finishes just off dry

A perplexing beer for sure. One could argue that this is a great example of a beer with non traditional ingredients and pulls it off due to lack of expectations. Others however, might say that this is hardly beer and is not good. Regardless of how weird this is, I like it quite a bit. DFH always keeps it weird",3.81
Midas Touch,"Appearance:
Pours a diaphanous shade of burnished gold blended with vibrant, daffodil yellow. Forms a dense, white froth, similar to the creamed bubbles that crown an authentic cappuccino. Leaves a geometrically perfect circle of sudsy white lacing that thins out the further it reaches, but endures unbroken all the way to the end.

Bouquet:
Bushels of honeysuckle flowers, trailed by a delicate mist of Moscato, puffed cereal grains, freshly sliced Honeycrisp apple, and a trace of orange rind that gently ushers the aroma away from being too sugary.

Feel:
A medium body that's granted manly heft by a foamy, nimbus texture I've never experienced before. Imagine if cotton candy were ghost and that'd put you near the mark of this ale's magical mouthfeel. A caress of sinful silk with a dry, Riesling finish.

Taste:
Honeycomb slathered in sweet, golden nectar. The honey aspect is earthy and intensely real. Not store-bought honey, not honey flavoring, more like: caveman who owns his own beehive, honey. This primal delight is followed by juicy white grapes, a liberal layer of powdery saffron, and a far-off melody of malts melded with tart fruit.",4.86
Midas Touch,"Nice fine head about a finger thick, lots of small carbonation bubbles. Clear gold in color. Smells like white wine/ champagne. It's hard to pin down the flavor, pretty unique. Like a mild bitter ale with hint of white grapes but nothing stands out which is good in it's own way. Finishes pretty dry. Overall, it's decent. Worth trying but not particularly my kind of brew.",3.67
Midas Touch,"Bottled on 6/28/2019, revisiting this classic after who knows how many years.

Look: The beer is translucent with a slight haze. Straw - pale gold. Some visible carbonation. A bone white head settles to a thin layer across the top of the beer, with some larger bubbles here and there. Some lacing at first that eventually goes away.

Smell: The nose on this pops with sweet and bready grains, and bright, vinous white grape that has white wine qualities. Apple and apple skin. Honeysuckle. As the beer warms the ABV becomes slightly noticeable, but not in a distracting way.

Taste: The taste is sweeter than the nose suggests, and the honey really comes out in the flavor. It’s bit heavier on the palate than the nose, as the white wine quality gets a bit lost with the sweetness. Quite bready and sweet with some yeast esters showing. The beer does dry out a bit.

Feel: Medium level of carbonation that offers some nice lively body to the sweet flavor. Starts sweet and dries out.

Overall: The nose on this beer is great. The flavor profile is a bit sweeter than the aroma suggests, and I’d love more of the grape profile in the flavor. That being said, this beer is very drinkable for 9%, and overall very enjoyable. Happy to have revisited.",4.14
Midas Touch,"Pours a copper-orange with bits of grit and particles suspended within the liquid as if they were frozen in time. Head is a finger and a half of off-white foam with modest retention. Aroma is honey, caramel, orange, tart green grapes, grassy, herbal and floral hops with a bit of biscuity, toasty malts behind. Very odd, but bright, aroma. Flavor profile is dense, layering notes of safron with tart, juicy grapes, orange rind, and honey. Malts form a light bready, earthy base, but the overall consistency is 'sweet'. Mouth feel is lightly pulpy with that suspended grain playing a role within the texture. It has a medium-thick consistency.

It does smell sweet like wine. Taste follows the nose and I get some sweetness that would make me think of soda pop almost. The flavors on the tongue are like an orange drink. It tastes good but it doesn't seem beer like at all. The mouthfeel is very nice. I think you pour this into a cup and tell someone it's soda pop and they wouldn't know the difference.

The aroma, woah, absolutely freakin’ awesomely apricot to peachy goodness filling a super nice semi-bitter piney hoppiness running about the nose. The taste was mostly bitter but lead to a nice semi-sweet citrus-ness concerning itself to try to run itself about a nice aftertaste and ended up leading to a fairly same finish. On the palate, this one shows a nice sessionable quality running about it and still lends a hand to a nice carbonation running about its body and shows that there is nothing overbearing of the sorts on any end.

This is not a style I generally pursue, but I found this beer to be tasty and the flavor grew on me as I consumed it.

Matilda,"I thought this was going to be bad as it foamed out the top of the bottle when opened. This was not an issue. Pours brownish, orange with nice lacing. Smells of bananas and tastes somewhat tart. Bottled August 24, 2016",3.96
Matilda,"Bottled 10/23/18

I’ve had this one sitting around for a while but it seems like every time I open the fridge I’m not really in the mood for something like this. Except tonight. I need some (Americanized) Belgian in my life

Pours a murky light brown with a finger of off white head that quickly reduces to a cap and leaves no lacing

The nose is pretty lively here. The Belgian yeast lends notes of banana, pepper, and light bubblegum. There’s minor notes of lemon and honey to support the yeast

Hmmm, this is more tart than I expected on the front end. Right off the bat I get tart lemon and mild pepper. Post swallow brings more of the same, but layers in sweet malt, light hops, and orange. Quite tasty actually

This has a medium body and very light carbonation, leading to a smooth and refreshing drink. It finishes a bit too sticky for my taste, but it works out in a beer like this

This was actually pretty good. I haven’t had many strong Belgian pales, but I might have to start seeking more out",4.09
Matilda,"Bottled and purchased from Altrincham town Tesco store

Aroma is candied peel and distilled grain
Flavour has that with a lovely tartness",3.84
Matilda,"Okay - I don't write connoisseur reviews. That said -- I like this beer because it isn't over the top hoppy, but still has that bite. I haven't seen many people describe it as a farmhouse ale, but that's how I would best describe it. The ABV seems a little stronger than 7%, but I'm not on my ass after a few. Not your ""after yard work"" beer; it's not what I would call ""refreshing"" -- more after you have showered and are getting ready for dinner. All things said, I would probably opt for Sofie, but Matilda is right after. My only disappointment -- they changed the label. The label below was classic!",3.97
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"This is a solid weissbier. Pours a hazy amber with a good, foamy head. Taste is of wheat and yeast. Overall, a fine weissbier. Tastes as good as it did when I first drank it in Germany in 1986. Surprised that AB Inbev has not ruined it the same manner they have so many of the other brands that they own.",4.67
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"0.5 L bottle
Bottle Date: 07.01.2022 (L007136)
Glass: 0.5L Hefeweizen Vase
Temp at Pour: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Opaque orange-tinged gold. I can see shadows of my fingers at the narrow part of the glass, but that's it. Initial 2-3-finger white head soon collapses to a thin (0.25"") but consistent cover. Decent lacing.

Smell:
Bananas, citrus fruits such as oranges and lemons, and notes of apricot/peach. White bread dough. A faint hint of cloves. There is that ""twang"" that I detect in most Weissbiers (and also more general wheat beers).

Taste:
Everything from the nose is present here, with a greater emphasis on the bananas, especially the overripe kind. Sweet oranges shine through the citrus. The cloves are also more pronounced and are joined by some cinnamon, but they only serve to balances the greater sweetness that the taste possesses. There is a hint of bubblegum towards the end, but the finish is restrained cloves and soft sweetness.

Feel:
Smooth, creamy, and soft with a medium body that can drift a shade light.

Overall:
A very good Weissbier that is more about the bananas and (citrus) fruits than about the cloves and spices. While not in the same tier as Weihenstephaner, Schneider, Ayinger, or Andechs, it is only one tier removed from those stalwarts. And is typically easier to find. A fine Weissbier for a spring or early summer afternoon.

I do want to mention that I find that the half-liter bottles provide me with a better experience than the one-third liter bottles. I am not sure why. But it is something that I have noticed over the years. YMMV.",4.03
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"Medium gold/orange, substantial white head.

Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"Really great hefe. A favorite of mine. Weiss is my favorite variety of beer. but German Weissbier, US brewers cant get this one right for some reason.",4.75
Franziskaner Premium Weissbier,"What can I say. This is one of my favorite beer of all time. Perfectly balanced, high carbonation, great mouth-feel, refreshing but with a delicious banana-toffee like taste. Has that bit of Sweetness which is so good in Weissbier, but without becoming overwhelming like in some others. It also has a cloudy, delicious look when poured.

I should add, i've never seen this beer in a can, only in a flask here in Sweden.

One of the best beers i've tried, period. That is, if you like wheat beer - if you do not, i'd say, avoid it. Otherwise, grab your wheat-beer glass, pour it cold on a sunny friday and just enjoy life.",5.0

A very fine Belgian Tripel.",4.58
Trappist Tripel,"A very slow pour released two fat fingers of creamy eggshell white foam with very long retention and irregular blotches of lace. Pale golden straw color, very hazy, I can barely see my fingers through it. I did not decant; some sediment is present.

Bold Belgian smell, aka, bubble gum, banana and bready malt with some funk greets the nose. Hop smell is mild and floral. Alcohol is noticeable yet considering the 9.5% ABV it is well hidden

Big taste of bready and caramel malt, semi-sweet with mild bitterness from alcohol more than hops. The alcohol taste is pervasive yet not astringent. Banana and clove in a Hefeweizen like way arrives late on the palate. The finish is fast, and flavors do not change much at the end. A peppery alcohol bite lingers that is warming and pleasant with bitterness rising to above average.

Medium-light malty body, well carbonated throughout the drink. Again, I must say how well the alcohol is hidden and presented. Balanced and easy to drink, the buzz hits quickly. This one is dangerously drinkable.",4.69

F - Fuller mouthfeel and lots of carbonation. A lot going on with each drink.

Trappist Tripel,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass
Appearance – The brew pours a lightly hazed golden amber color with a huge head of puffy white foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, fading slowly over time to leave a good sum of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a biscuit and cracker malt mixed with aromas of white grape and yeast. Along with these smells comes spice of clove and coriander as well as some apricot and peach. With a touch of harvest fruit and a bit of candied sugar an overall very inviting aroma is produced.
Taste – The taste begins with a mix of cracker malt and candied sugar sweetness mixed with flavors of apricot, grape and peach. At the same time there is a nice spice of coriander and clove as well as a decent showing of yeast cake and grain. As the taste advances the grain, spice, and candied sugar tastes fad a tad, all while the fruit, especially the peach, and yeast grown stronger. At the same time some hay and a touch of pear arrive on screen, producing a very pleasant, crisp, and flavorful taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium and crisp with a carbonation level that is high. For the tastes the feel is spot on, and makes for a very nice crisp sipper.
Overall – A fantastic tripel. Super flavorful and crisp with a very easy drinking and balanced flavor. Defiantly one of the best out there.",4.51
Trappist Tripel,"330 ml bottle, exp. 09/23, excellent beer. Foam never ends. Dense. Alcohol mixes well with other scents, sweet ones. A hidden citric note fits well on mouth. The excess of foam is beautiful but is a bit of a disturbance to the tasting of it.",4.57
Trappist Tripel,"The beer is a hazy, translucent, bubbly yellow color, kind of straw but looks more burnt orange when held up to a light. Some yeast sediment is in it. Ample carbonation leaves a huge soapy white head that lingers.

The aroma is slightly sour and mildewy, some orange and lemon juice, big white wine/white grape must come to think of it, hay, toasty biscuit, slight sweetness, and white pepper.

The taste follows the nose pretty closely. The main flavors upfront are of dry white wine complimented by a nice tart citrus, (orange and lemon peel) and subtle barnyard funk, with hay, toasted cracker, and a white pepper floating in the background. The wheat and effervescent carbonation give this a fluffy and extremely pleasant mouthfeel. It closes out on a perfect balance of the sweet-dry spectrum. A hint of sweetness to tantalize the taste buds but dry enough to beg the next sip. This brew is wonderfully made. Holy mackerel. I see why many people consider this to be the quintessential Belgian tripel.",4.72
Trappist Tripel,"Westmalle Tripel.... it's been a minute since I've had a tripel, and I quite enjoy them, first time with this one.
Poured into a stemless total wine glass. Hazy gold body, huge soapy white head off a gentle pour. Loose, large bubbles, bone white, slowly fall back to a 1/4"" thin head that persists through the life of the beer. Large chunks of sediment despite an attempt to decant.
Nose? Banana, bubble gum, peppercorns, candi sugars, candied lemon peel. A lot going on, complex, no diacetyl or dms, phenols out the wazoo. No hops to speak of. Yeast driven nose, everything else is buried. As it warms there is a slight white wine smell coming through.
Taste, Bananas, bubble gum, alcohol, rock candy. Slight lemon on the aftertaste if I look hard. No hops, no grain, dry. As the beer warms there is a vineous note.
Mouthfeel- thin bodied and dry. Phenols give a suggestion of sweetness as does the alcohol. Effervescent. Each sip bursts into small bubbles as it hits the palate.
Overall. It's a well made beer, the yeast phenols push it into hefe territory for me. I much prefer Karmaleit when it comes to the style. Not sure why I got so much banana from this bottle.",3.72
Trappist Tripel,"Pours a cloudy bright orange color. Mostly opaque with a moderate amount of suspended sediment. Thick two finger white head forms on the beer, settles in, then dissipates leaving just a thin layer of foam on top of the beer. The aroma on this is lovely - it has notes of malts, white grape, apple, pear, some light banana, and some floral hop notes. Its subtle, refined, yet complex.

The taste follows the nose with notes of rich malts, belgian yeast that leans into the fruity side of things with notes of apple, pear, white grape and just a hint of banana. Along with the fruity notes come some spiced notes - clove, allspice and peppercorn. Moderately spicy, but not overly so. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish with a light floral character. Feel is medium bodied, smooth, and somewhat warming. Very carbonated with a bright, lively mouthfeel.

Overall this is an outstanding tripel and one I will absolutely revisit.",4.51
Trappist Tripel,"An absolutely gorgeous glass of beer that lasts to the last sip. Cloudy pale orange white sudsy head, but no lacing. This was flavorful and aromatic, banana, clove, caramel and a hint of pear. Smooth, creamy texture, long lasting carbonation. This is just a really great beer, I just didn't like.",4.27
Trappist Tripel,"Pours a cloudy, golden amber coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head. Smells of caramel malt, floral hops, with hints of citrus, some fruity esters and hints of toffee. Taste is a great balance of caramel malt, fruity and slightly spicy esters, with notes of banana, apricot and clove, as well as lighter floral, bitter hops with hints of orange rind and toffee also coming through. Finishes bittersweet, with some banana, orange rind and clove lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

This is actually the first time I've had this Tripel and while it is very good indeed, it doesn't quite reach Tripel Karmeliet or Chimay Tripel to me. The banana notes are quite at the forefront here, which I'm not a huge fan of, while the spice is noticeable, but a little subdued. Nevertheless there's a great balance of malts, hops and esters to this, with quite a rich and full body and mouthfeel as well. I was actually surprised by how much hops, relatively speaking, are left in this at just over one year old and would love to try it fresh sometime, which just might edge it a little closer to my aforementioned favorites. Also, considering that this has the highest ABV out of any Tripel I've tried so far, it really doesn't feel overly boozy at all.",4.29

Trappist Tripel,One of the Original triples from Belgium I believe this beer got it all amazing golden color milky head perfectly high carbonation and bitter sweet finish it’s a classic and I love it! And you should too!!,5.0
Trappist Tripel,"Pours a hazy golden colour with a strong orange tint, a pillowy three inch head appears and slowly collapses into a thick, lacing creamy line of white.

On first smell, there is a deep, savoury aroma unlike anything I’ve smelled before. Will have to come back to this (many times!) to develop my palate a bit more. Suffice it to say, it’s very enticing. Delicious aromas of yeasty breads, wheat, and spices waft around. Banana’s and specifically green apples make up a strong fruity backbone — less citrus and juicy, more of that smoother textured fruits, the aforementioned creamy bananas, silty earthy apples. Again, that tasty savoury aroma appears almost heavy in my nose. Maybe I know what people mean when they say ‘doughy yeast’ now

Taste does follow the nose, and is remarkably complex in many ways. Spicy fruits up front here for me, apples cloves and nutmeg, a little sweet with maybe only the slightest hint of hop bitterness. Savoury in the middle with tasty grains and malty notes, candi sugar, and banana. There is a very long finish that rests on a gentle bitter-sweetness, remaining with a doughy taste on your tongue.

Medium bodied, this is well carbonated but not carbonated too strong as to overpower the flavours. Coalesces into a creamy sip on the way down, finishes dry and bittersweet leaning on the sweet side.

I love overpowering malty Tripels, which is not what you get with Westmalle. Instead, you get one that is a little gentler, but melds an enormous amount of wonderful aromas and flavours into a perfectly blended and smooth beer. No note stands out too much, each has its place and they wax and wane in and out together to create a remarkable experience. Absolutely wonderful beer",4.4

Nose is brown sugar, clove, allspice, banana, and some earthy hop notes as well; light roast as well as it warms. Taste leads candy, sugary sweet with only light baking spice notes to rein things in. Sweetness dissipates quickly, however, as warming notes from the alcohol become more prominent. As the beer warms, light spice and banana come through, but the dominant flavor is brown sugar, and the beer is lacking in depth. Mouthfeel is soft and smooth with mild but bright carbonation.",3.69

Bottle poured into a large nonic

Brewers Notes: Without a doubt Unibroue’s best-known beer, La Maudite is inspired by abbey beers and Belgian double-style ales. It first hit the shelves in 1992 and took the province by storm with its 8% alcohol content, making it the first strong beer available in grocery stores.

That’s where the idea came to tie its name and branding to a pact signed with the devil. The illustration of the “chasse-galerie” (or flying canoe) from a belove

Taste is slightly sweet , caramel ,malts

Fizzy , sudsy mouthfeel

Good beer",4.21
Maudite,"A near opaque matte, dull rust/copper body with an aggressive but not violent red clay tinged head. Lacing is pretty good. Nose is a mix of toast, spice, and yeasty notes including a little bubble gum. The toasted grain lays a nice foundation for a mix of orchard fruit jam and fall spices. The opening feel is nice, punching in around medium with a softness, but the carbonation ends up a little less restrained than the head it helps produce. A nice balance of malt and bitterness, with quite complimentary flavors.",4.02
Maudite,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a DFH Goblet Glass

The beer pours a murky copper color with about three fingers worth of foamy white head that slowly recedes leaving some light lacing behind

The aroma is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread, raisins, plums, banana, and caramel. There is also a spicy aroma that compliments the sweetness

Like the nose, the flavor is sweet and malty with notes of toasted bread and dark fruits. Lightly spicy with some caramel and toffee that rounds it out. Medium bodied and moderately carbonated with a smooth finish

Overall, Maudite is a nice beer with a lot going for it. Very nice",4.09
Maudite,"This is a bottle from 2011, so please take that into account with this review.

It pours a muddy reddish-brown that seems to be in line with fresh, but not much of a head. Clears decently as it warms up.

The smell is fruity, both the raison fig contingent and some nice apple. Slightly spicy, peppery, heavy on the bread. Very weak banana when fully warmed.

The taste opens sweet and spicy, black pepper and coriander. The pepper sensation lingers thru and continues well after the swallow. The sweetness morphs into the fig/raisin fruit thing rather nicely. I thought the malty bready notes would be stronger, but they show up almost as a third layer of flavor. There's a toffee flavor that I think can be chalked up to age. It's kind of a subdued malt bomb where the malt is strong, but the supporting cast gets equal billing.

Mildly carbonated, peppery tingle lingers, sweet but not sticky, and towards the dry side despite the sweet part.

Overall, this tastes pretty fine. I'd buy it again based on how it tastes now. I'm feeling it has lost some edge but has mellowed into something pleasant.",4.06
Maudite,"Pours a cloudy, deep ochre colour in a tall goblet. Generous 4-5 inch head slowly condenses into a thick two inch head supported by the carbonation over the next 15 minutes.

Smells are lovely and complex. Overall spicy smells up front followed by gentle malts. Lots of bread, spices, peppery stuff here.

What a lovely taste. There are three parts on most of my sips. The up front — strong and peppery, coriander and Black pepper. Followed by the middle, which comes quickly after the spicy sip — malts and hop character swirl around, sweet bread and yeast followed by some grassy, clove-like bitterness. It ultimately finishes with the strong malt, yeast backbone, and the coriander and orange citrus notes can absolutely be noticed here.

As the beer warmed and I continued to sip I noticed a tiny bit of candied plum flavours in the finish, which again, was strongly malt forward and relatively sweet.

Beer is medium-ish bodied, smooth, nice carbonation, the alcohol doesn’t present a strong bite here anywhere. Finishes sweet but mostly dry.

This is overall quite a gorgeous beer. The one time I’m happy to be in Canada when it comes to beer is being so close to Unibroue. We can’t import international beers, and our offerings are tightly controlled by the government liquor boards, but we always always always can get the first pickings of Unibroue’s beers. Their winter collection is awesome. Maudite is an excellent beer and it has been 10 years ago when I first tried it, and is excellent to this very day.",4.24

a amber tinged brown with a nice head of white foam that settles to a
thick ring, thin dusty layer, and shows off some nice light lacing. Nose of

notes. Flavors follow nicely with dark bread, spicy yeast, herbal balanced
hops, dates, fig, candy sugar, and coriander. Nice mouth feel;

Maudite,"Sampling a cellar temp 12 oz bottle poured into my snifter. I picked this up at a local beer store recently to keep checking off Beers of Fame!
The beer pours a fairly clear amber to mahogany color with a fluffy beige colored head of about 3 cm. This foam fades slowly leaving some sticky lattice on my glass.
The aroma has some light caramel malt and a bit of cloves and light cinnamon. No real hop presence and the 8% booze is hidden too. the nose is sort of mild overall, but is appealing and works for the style.
The first sip reveals a medium body with slightly syrupy texture and fine tingly carbonation. Feels like its a little bit of a bigger beer.
Flavor is malty up front with caramel and some brown sugar and then rolls to a bit of green apple hit and quickly gives over to spices of clove and cinnamon. I get a bit of black pepper bite on the finish and mild warming booze on the swallow.
This is a fun beer to revisit after quite a hiatus. Im going to circle back to many of the Unibroue line again. This is worth a sampling for a Dubbel with some spiciness.",4.23
Maudite,Another home run. It’s amazing how balanced and well crafted this beer is. It’s even better than actual Belgian dubbels I’ve had. Just please don’t tell the monks,4.55
Curmudgeon,"A 2016 version, poured out of a 32oz crowler that I picked up @ SLL in Sept. 21. I’ve always enjoyed this beer fresh and cold, but leaving this beer out and sipping my way through it was great for exposing the beer’s full spectrum of aromas and flavors. This is one of the most inviting beers, if based on looks alone - a beautifully clear deep amber body is capped with a dense light tan head that clings to the glass as it slowly recedes. Note that the last of the crowler poured a bit murkier and more caramel colored than amber. The aromas are initially dominated by a mix of over ripe orchard fruits and darker, sweet, dried fruits on a raisin toast-like malt base. There is a hint of vanilla and a good dose of other oak-barrel, bourbon-like alcohol flavors to stiffly balance this beers rich base. As it warms, there’s nutty/hazelnut, caramel and toffee notes that come forward in the taste. If there’s a moment where the hops shine, it’s mid-finish where they come across as mildly herbal and lightly spicy. Medium to full-bodied with just enough carbonation and abv to keep the beer from coming across as too heavy. I haven’t had many old ales as of late, and the [English] one’s I remember were quite different. Overall, for someone who really likes big, complex, aged ales - this beer is a standout.",4.12
Curmudgeon,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgaard. ABV is 9.8%. 50 IBU. Cloudy brown colour, low beige head of poor retention. Sweetish malty aroma, notes of caramel and oak, hints of dark dried fruits and alcohol. Not as sweet flavour as I feared, malty and oaky, caramel and dried figs, well balanced with the hops, a nice bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. Would buy again.",3.83
Curmudgeon,"Just about as beautiful a brew can be. A request for a pint came from a tap, in a clear glass vessel. The color is a dark copper, bright, yet not translucent. The head is just barely biege, enduring and contributes to some wonderful glass lacing. The aroma is malty, almost stout-like malty. This is also good inside the mouth. It's rich, sweet, smooth and malty. But that's not all. Molasses and hops bring an earthiness that, without being bitter, enhance what would make a good ale, like a Wee Heavy Scottish Ale. The almost 10% ABV is unnoticed. That it's on the heavy side is a good thing, for any lighter, it would go down too quickly for the overall welfare of its consumer. Overall, complexly excellent.",4.5
Curmudgeon,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with no dates, served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: It develops a thin, half finger head that disappears almost immediately and leaves behind a layer of big bubbles that stay until the end. It's a murky, light brown color.

Smell: It's a sweet smell of plums, raisins, molasses and malt with a hint of alcohol in the background.

Taste: It's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. There's dried fruit, molasses and brown sugar. It finishes with an earthy, oak note and some alcohol.

Mouthfeel: It's smooth, slightly oily and strong but not heavy at all with a medium body and low carbonation.

Overall: Even though it goes heavily towards the sweeter side, it's not cloying and the sweetness is not one dimensional. There's a lot of different elements to unpack and discover which makes this a really good beer.",4.04
Curmudgeon,"Burnt orange in color with a nice light tan head. Update: the 2nd 12oz bottle was much flatter, headless. Pleasant aroma of molasses, plum & alcohol. Taste is bitter sweet. Nice flavor: plum, raisin, molasses,alcohol, brown sugar, oak flavors & malt. Medium viscousity. Excellent.",3.99

Curmudgeon,"Draught 8oz snifter at the Brass Tap here in Baltimore. Definitely, prefer this to the ""...Better Half"", and even the Smuttynose ""Really Old Brown Dog"".

The aroma is crackers and a hint of lemon.
The taste is fresh biscuits, hints of banana, lemon and cloves.
The body is light/medium, good carbonation level, smooth and very drinkable.
Altogether, this is a refreshing and enjoyable wheat ale. Should be good for a warm summer day.",3.51
312 Urban Wheat,"Purchased in 2022, looks like they updated the packaging to a more modern look so I am giving it a plus for that. The smell and taste are more present than I would imagine from a wheat ale, plus for that. Citrus flavor that stands out the most, really refreshing and the carbonation isn't extreme but good enough to feel smooth going down. Absolutely recommend on a hot day.",3.91
312 Urban Wheat,smell is very light. the taste isn’t bad typical wheat beer flavor. one of the better wheat beers i’ve had. the feel is nice and light as well. overall i think it’d be a great summer lounge beer,3.52

312 Urban Wheat,"Purchased as a single bottle from Kroger for $1.69. Poured into a hefe glass.

L - Hazy goldenrod with a three-finger sudsy, thick cream head.
S - Bubblegum and wheat. Spray-starch. Slight lemon peel.
T - Exactly the same as the smell.
F - Well-carbonated and sudsy. Clean finish. Wet. Very approachable.
O - An alright choice for a mid-day beer. The perfect beer to review as my 100th BA beer! I'll be honest - the flavor and scent profiles are simplistic even for the style, but the feel makes up for it all. It's nice and refreshing, and would honestly pair well with any sort of summer fare. It's an incredibly drinkable wheat ale, with plenty of inoffensive qualities. It's just that nothing really stands out, except for the beautiful three-finger head that lingers to the completion of the brew. This is going to sound a bit silly, but it's almost like drinking dishwater - but in a weirdly good way. I'd buy this again as a beer to offer house guests, but not so much for myself.",3.2
312 Urban Wheat,"Pours a cloudy straw yellow with a white cap that lingers, minimal spotty lacing. Aroma is mild, lemon. Flavor follows the nose. Feel is light bodied with adequate carbonation. Overall a decent beer without any real pluses.",3.29
312 Urban Wheat,"Picked this one up at the local liquor store because I remember going to Chicago Cubs games as a kid and seeing 312 being advertised and sold all over the place. I thought why not give this one a try on this beautiful Memorial Day here in Michigan. I will say the bottle on this one is beautiful. I am a guy who drinks straight out of the bottle and I will say this is one nice-looking bottle compared to your other generic wheat beers. This beer has a very wheaty smell and to me smells just like a ""beefed-up"" version of a typical American lager such as Miller or Coors. That smell goes right into the taste because this is a very wheaty/grainy tasting beer. While it is filling, this is a smooth beer that would go great with a day on the lake. A nice 6 pack of this stuff will serve you will an incredible day on a summer day.",3.24
312 Urban Wheat,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 4.4%. Pale golden colour, hazy when the yeast is poured in, moderate white head.

Notes of wheat, lemongrass, citrus and citrus peels (particularly lemon), cloves, banana, coriander, and pepper.

2XIPA,"Clear light amber color with a decent and lasting foamy white head, some nice lacing.
The aroma is grapefruit, pine and hints of caramel.
The taste is also grapefruit and pine resin followed by light caramel malt. The finish is somewhat dry with lingering pine and a hint of alcohol.
The body is medium, smooth, good carbonation.
Altogether this a modest but fairly well balanced and tasty brew. An excellent imperial IPA.",4.04
2XIPA,"Purchased as part of a 15-can variety pack from Sam's Club for $16.89. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Burnt orange with a slight haze. A one-finger off-white head pours with it; disappears rather quick. Lacing isn't too terrible.
S - Candied grapefruit peel, pine resin, and some grassiness. Citron presence is strong, but hidden behind the pine. A bit of ethanol on the nose.
T - While I am aware of the citron and grapefruit presence, the bitter pine tar flavors are a bit overwhelming here. Definitely on the bitter side of things - with a side of earthy wheat.
F - Medium-full in body, with low carbonation. Ethanol burn becomes more intense towards the end of the glass. Filling.
O - An unfortunately average DIPA. While I fully understand the angle here, the intense bitterness isn't justified here. The citrus notes that were supposed to be the star here was covered up by a surge of pine and ethanol - especially towards the end. I'll be completely honest - I won't be getting this one again. For those hop bomb lovers out there, even this may be too much for you. It's worth a try, though.",2.92
2XIPA,19.2 ounce can. Bright CLEAR beautiful copper with lasting rocky head and lace. Orange mango aroma with a hint of honey and pine. Medium sweet grainy honey and not too peachy fruity. Medium citrus bitterness and some pine to clean everything up. Nice carbo medium-heavy body. Fucking excellent.,4.56
2XIPA,And with the final one from the mix pack (I saved the flagship for last) these are way too sweet. IPA shouldn't remind me of candy. The ABV isn't that high either. These are a complete miss for me unsurprisingly. They're not bad or undrinkable but yeah.,3.54
2XIPA,"Clear gold with a white head, great retention, rings of lace
Grapefruit and tangerine aroma
Grapefruit and pine flavor, a bit of alcohol, long bitter finish
Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation, a little hot
Too much alcohol for a 8.2% beer",3.34
2XIPA,"12oz can with a big smudged date on the bottom

Looks like a movie beer, very slight cloudiness with a nice cap of foam that sticks around. At least it isn't riding the hazy train, I'm going off the rails with these hazy grain (IPAs). Smells like earth, pine and caramel malts. Drinks a little slick and feels higher than the 8.2% listed, but a well-balanced IPA nonetheless; read: malt forward to most. Grapefruit rind, fresh grass, fresh grass that costs $20 a gram (also known as WEED, DOOD), and also a pine tart finish

It's good but nothing worth seeking out. As far as hops, the bill here could pass as a pale ale or even a lager... I imagine they are cutting costs and hoping no one notices. Maybe some will like a pale ale that happens to be 8.2% - I think it's kinda lame",2.7
2XIPA,"Beautiful, clear and golden body; nice slow rising carbonation; thick and billowy white head with excellent retention. Big aroma of mild caramel interspersed with spicy, pungent hoppiness; a touch of pine resin. Sweet and peppery flavor; caramel again; anise. Heavy body; chewy residual sugars; mild coarseness; semi-dry overall.

This is sample was a bit dated (bottle best by date: 05/06/21), yet it still has a fine balanced and depth going for it. It may be a bit sweet in the taste and mouthfeel, but how much the age of the beer may play a factor in this, I don't know. Still, I like it and would love to try it again.",4.08
2XIPA,"355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar,Stavanger. ABV is 8.2%. Golden colour, moderate white head. Nice aroma of citrussy American hops. Distinct flavour of citrussy and resinous American hops, fairly dry. Light bodied for its strength. Dangerously drinkable. Oh dear, was the bottle empty already?",3.8
2XIPA,"Pours a golden color, but clear, not hazy. Very strong pine resin on the nose with malt in the back. Taste is powerful hops and pine, a bit of sour malt. Bitter, lingering aftertaste. I'm just not getting the citrus a lot of others are talking about, and I wish I did. This is all strong, sour pine to me. Make it your last of the night because it's going to be hard to get a neutral palate back afterward.",3.77
2XIPA,The taste of alcohol was noticeable from the first sip. It took me some time to get past it. Some citrus flavor but more subdued in comparison to other IPA’s.,3.09
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"500mL bottle stamped 22.018 131021 poured into a wheat beer glass at fridge temp 8.2% ABV. The beer pours opaque medium brown with light khaki head.

Minimal bitterness. Slight alcohol presence on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Overall, very good weizenbock. Not my favoritist style, but I can appreciate this one.",4.37

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,The flavor delightfully remained on my palate after the mild flowing over my rounds of this delicious doppelbock. It developed a nice flavorful head when I poured it in to a glass. The feel was not heavy like some doppelbock s can be. I truly loved this beer.,4.77
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"On tap at Wurstkuche in Downtown Los A feels, CA.

Like visiting your local fishing hole and snagging a trout on your first cast, this one is legit. And the glass is cute like Ariana Grande with cat ears (before she got extra freaky). Either way, Aventinus is an Ace, Home Run, or a Slam dunk, what have you.

Get it on and get it good, my children.",4.25
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"L: dark amber, nothing too distinctive, but it's certainly appealing in a glass
S: rum, malt, and bananas

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"0.5 L bottle
Glass: .5L Weizenbock Vase
Bottle Date: 19.308 => 161019 => 16-Oct-2019
Serving Temp: 51.6 F


Look:
Cloudy and murky medium brown that is opaque from the yeast. I can't see my fingers at all through the glass, not even at the narrow point. 3-finger creamy beige head dissipates slowly to a 1-finger creamy cover. Great lacing
(This last bottle saw the ale starting to foam out of the bottle a few seconds after I opened it).

Smell:
Absolutely wonderful. Spiced plums and pears. Rum-soaked dried fruits such as raisins and currants. Rich brown sugar. Overripe bananas. Bread dough.

Taste:
As good as it smells, if not better. Cloves bite at the front, but not all that hard. Rich toffee and toasted caramel joion in quickly, along with plums, those rum-soaked dried fruits and the overripe banana. There are notes of whole wheat bread and even banana bread. Some pepper and maybe a dash of cinnamon. Finishes with a lingering combination of rich dark fruits and cloves which somehow comes across as ever-so-slightly dry and spicy.

Feel:
Rich and creamy with a body that is on the heavier side of medium.

Overall:
What a joy to drink. A phenomenal beer. This earns it's World Class reputation. Although one can smell and taste rum-soaked fruit, the alcohol is actually quite well hidden. Very easy to drink. Dangerously so. Goes down smooth as silk but will hit you like a sledgehammer if you aren't careful. Great stuff. This is one of my favorite beers, and has been for well over a decade, if not 2. Absolutely worth trying.

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"Poured into a tulip, a large three finger head manifests. Tiny bubbles at the bottom, thick ones at the top, it slowly coalesces into a permanent, two finger thick dense, rocky, creamy foamy head that lasts the entire time. A slightly hazy, deep red-brown colour, this looks absolutely phenomenal in the glass. An absolute triumph. It collapses into one of the densest foam heads I’ve ever seen on any beer — not sure what some of the other reviews below are about, but maybe their cans weren’t as fresh as mine.

Very strong aromas of wheat and malt make up the base of the smell, slightly toasty. A little bit of boozy rum, and dried fruits like crispy sugared banana rings or raisins. Some spices and cloves of course!

Taste follows the nose but there are some new flavours here, such as banana bread, some nutty flavours like almond, and maybe even a little bit of orange? Spicy cloves, toasty wheats, chewy malts, the works! Fig, raisin, rum flavours as well. Complex, and even a bit subtle at times. Except for those wheaty, malty, banana spice flavours, those are always up front.

Smooth delicious mouthfeel, good carbonation that prickles your tongue without being too excessive as to wash away the flavours. Medium bodied I’d say, and it coalesces into a creamy gulp at the end of each sip. A nice long finish that is mildly sweet and keeps the general malts and candied fruits and banana on the tongue.

My oh my, what can you really say about this except for how good it is? I had to eisbock first and wanted to see how it compared. The Eisbock definitely concentrates some of the flavour, especially the malt and the darker flavours such as raisin and figs. So what is the difference? Other than the lower abv% here, the weizenbock keeps more of its dried and candied fruit flavours, and the orange/citrus fruit peel flavours as well. This one definitely has more banana in there as well. Both are champions of their respective styles, and in my opinion, the absolute top tier benchmark.

The Aventinus line is bold, beautiful, complex, and easy drinking. Absolutely phenomenal stuff. I’m overjoyed I grabbed the last 6 Eisbocks in all of Canada from the LCBO and always keep my fridge stocked with a couple of the regular Aventinus as well. 100% an absolute must try if you like German beers, or honestly, if you like beer in general.",4.36

Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"500ml can into a pint glass. No freshness dating that I could find.

Looks pretty good in the glass. Deep reddish amber/brown body. Small white head shrinks to a ring, only a little lacing.

Strong malty aroma with some boiled candy notes.

On tasting, quite sweet, banana and spice notes, good and malty. Abv definitely felt.

Mouth above medium, finish warming with a light layer of sweet spice.

Overall, this one was quite delicious, and went down way too easy. Drinker beware.",4.18
Tap 6: Mein Aventinus,"I'll preface by saying I went back to my job because I wanted the Eisbock but it turns out we just have this so I didn't exactly get what I wanted but anyways, I don't find this near the banana bomb some reviews say, I wish It was there more, to me this tastes very similar to the Belgian beer Kwak. Heavy on wheat and clove where as the spice and banana is super background. This is really good but idk how much I'd seek this in the future I really wanna try the eisbock",4.0

Hop Rod Rye,"Bottle poured into a Bear Republic Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours copper brown amber with a frothy tan head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Toasty bready malt, rye spice, earthy, herbal, pine, floral notes, light citrus, faint hints of dark fruit, and a little toffee sweetness.

T: Peppery rye right up front, toasty bready malt, spicy pine, floral notes, underlying citrus, grapefruit lemon, and orange, earthy, green herbal notes, hints of dark fruit, and toffee sweetness.

M: Just a touch on the fuller side of medium body, moderate carbonation. Deceptively smooth for an 8%er.

O: Could have sworn I reviewed this one at some point, but I'm glad I was able to snap some up. Definitely a piece of NorCal brewing history. Excellent Rye IPA!",4.19
Hop Rod Rye,"16oz can poured into a New Belgium globe.

A: Dark ruby red color with lighter orange hues. Super healthy head formation and retention. A solid two and a half fingers of cream-coloered head stick around for the duration and leave behind gobs of chunky lacing in a loose ring formation.

S: Juiced ruby red grapefruit, pine and resin, green and spicy hop oils. Underlying malt toastiness, sharper earthy rye spice, and a distinct crystal malt sweetness that brings a touch or berry/candy shell. Clean fermentation profile, probably chico yeast.

T: Opens with a fat crystal malt sweetness. Caramel, toffee, and candy shell. This very quickly gives way to a drying blanket of toastiness, flashes of burnt crust, and a lot of spicy rye. Hop profile hits hard and fast with a lot of vibrant and bitter ruby red grapefruit juice. Butter line and resin too, along with an oily and green spiciness. Bitterness is quite firm. The finish dries quite a bit with long lingering rye spice, oily hop bitterness, and traces of soot.

M: Full bodied with some chewiness and a very round and creamy malt texture. Plenty of raking hop astringency too. Ample carbonation scrubs firmly.

O: What a throwback. I do think this is the first rye IPA I ever had, circa 2008, but I can't remember ever revisiting it before today. I do miss rye beer in general, and feel like it got unfairly buried under the sea of west coast and hazy IPAs. This particular beer is considered a venerable classic within the rye sub-styles, and deservedly so. I love what they've done with the hop profile: the rye is unabashedly bold, and there's some interesting specialty malt character to round things out and create just enough balance to ground the bitterness and spiciness. Drinking it bakes me feel like I pulled something special out of the beer archives, but in this case I didn't have to blow any dust off of it because it was nice and fresh at my local packie.",4.11
Hop Rod Rye,"Pours a hazy brown with a small head and light lacing.

This is an excellent old-school West Coast IPA.",4.15
Hop Rod Rye,"From notes 12/15/12: Pours a clear hazy deep amber/light brown which clears some as it warms. As the beer settles a small amount of sediment becomes evident. The pour produces a heavy finger of frothy, variously bubbled, somewhat lasting, light tan head that leaves a thin pasty wash of lace. Aroma is hop forward earthy, floral, grapefruit, pine with a fruity hint, rye bread and rye spice. Taste is nicely balanced: earthy, grapefruit, orange zest, pine: caramel malt heavy, rye spice and a hint of chocolate. Sweet, lightly bitter finish with a caramel bitter aftertaste. The 8% ABV is well hidden with pleasant warming appearances in the finish and aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy with moderate carbonation, very smooth, creamy and rich. Very, very nice.",4.4
Hop Rod Rye,"A really smooth, pleasant quaff. The rye gives it a spicy complexity, but it retains the fruitiness and herbal qualities of a nice brown ale.

s) IPA made more bitter, more astringent by rye. But too faint.
t) Taste is abundant. Brings intense bittering, balanced by grainy sweet, whiskey like but hiding ABV well, then cascade of hop citrus, pine, grass, earthy floor, and dank flavors. Some mollasses, dark toasted grain, long finish, with pepper, muskiness, earthiness.
f) Creamy, great mouth feel, luscious. Matches the whiskey, creamy head look.
o) Overall favorite rye (18%!) beer.",4.27

My favorite from Ommegang so far.",4.71

I have to slurp up the foam to keep it from overflowing like champagne and like champagne the foam wash fruity and light.

Initially it smells like a white or blush whine but then a bit of malt comes through.

The taste is like other trappist beers I've had. It's extremely fruity with just a little malt and then some bitterness. Like some kind of sparkling wine/beer mix.

It's very foamy and smooth with a ton of soft carbonation. It's finish is lasting fruit and bitterness.

Overall it's much like a few other Belgian Trappist dubbels, trippels and quads I've had. It's the best of those though. I would give it a 4.7 out of 6 as a beer but for the style it would get a 5.7.",3.84

Tulip glass .

Pours 1.5 fingers off white/tan ,soapy head, dissipates quickly, leaving slight lace around glass ,

Smell is- fruity-cherry-currents,with earthy hop and hint of clove .

Taste- strong notes of pepper-corriander hint of orange zest, malt and cherry .

Finish is -creamy, medium carbonation with a nice spicy finish on the tongue.

Overall very tasty for a high ABV beer- no alcohol bite to speak of-love the peppery bite and hints of stone fruit. I'll definitely look for this one again.

Two thumbs up to the brewers!",3.4
Abbey Ale,"Pours deep garnet with an ample tan head with ample lacing and carbonation. Aroma and taste is that of dried fruits and brown sugar. Finish is dry and smooth.

Abbey Ale,"Exceptional quality of flavors and textures in this beer. This is Ommegang doing what it does best - really solid, perfectly crafted, mostly traditional style Belgian ales.

Abbey Ale,"L: 12oz bottle into a tall, straight-sided glass. Three fingers of dense light-brown foam atop a clear ruby-brown body. Strong retention but only light lacing. Very nice.

S: Good balance of bready malt (pumpernickel?) and fruit. Complex fruitiness, with hints of cherry, red grape, and plum. Some distant peppery spice. Restrained and interesting.

T: Follows the nose, but with more intensity: sweet malt up front, with rich fruit and spice toward the back end. Grape, fig, and some nice nuttiness as well. Dry, yeasty finish with just a bit of warming alcohol. Delicious and nuanced.

F: Medium-bodied and hugely effervescent. Suits the style.

O: Delicious beer, and by far the most authentically Belgian-tasting American version of the style I've ever tried. I'd take this over Chimay Red 10 times out of 10. If it has a flaw, it's that it's a bit boozy for the style, but that's to be expected with its 8.2% ABV. Beer of Fame tick 177/250. Cheers!",4.42
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"I tried it for the first time and love it. It tastes like Budweiser but it goes down smooth w/o competition from its ingredients. It don't taste watered down like some beers nor does it taste like horse piss haha.

I can't comment on look as I always drink straight outta the bottle - cans included.

Smell - smells like it tastes. Bold in character, you can tell alot thru smell, if its pleasing to the nose, its pleasing to the palate. Which this is both ways.",4.63
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Guinness is where it all started for me. In a world where the challenge was to quaff Genessee Beer until my friends deposited me on my parents’ doorstep and rang the bell, I was introduced to Guinness by an Irish man. He said ‘if you’re going to drink beer, drink Good Beer’. I never forgot that.,.

The One that started my never ending search for Better Stout, I think of Guinness every time.
Familiar, roasty, toasty, just the right amount if carbonation, nice aroma, and, they say, it’s Good For Me.
I’ll have another, please.,.",3.98
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Dark and slightly roasted with hints of chocolate and coffee. Bittersweet and pleasant. I know that the mouthfeel is different when it’s poured from a draft as opposed to straight out of the bottle, but I kinda wanted a little more carbonation. However, it is silky smooth and easy to enjoy.",3.89
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Black in color with minimal light penetration. There’s a fingernail of brown around the rim and covering most of the top. Moderate, soapy lacing. The aroma is of dark roasted malt and a hint of smoke. I’m tasting dark roasted malt, toasted nuts, and just a suggestion of smoke. The mouth is lightly sticky, chewy, and dry.",3.77
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"I wonder sometimes what people expect in a beer. I have plenty of friends that drink Coors Light 24/7-365. They must have a corn fetish? Personally I hate ""corn water"". I only concede any ground when the thermometer goes north of 95-degrees and then I'll take a Corona, Victoria, or Modelo...keep the twist thank you. To get to the point I think ""real"" beer should be somewhat complex and accessible. That's what Guiness Extra Stout is. The world's most popular non-alcoholic beverages would include coffee, tea, and cola and it's no mistake that Guiness has elements of all of these universally adored drinks. The complexity comes from the combination of malted grain sugars in the right naturally carbonated mix. Extra Stout has it and regular draught, to me, doesn't even if it has ten nitro balls. Extra Stout has the ""correct"" mouth feel which is refreshing and clean. Extra Stout has the balance of chocolates, coffees, dates, and bitters. It's almost a miracle a rather full and heavy beer is so refreshing and drinkable. Like a great steak there will come a point where enough is enough and more would be an insult. Even so I can drink a whole sixer of this rather full-bodied brew though I'd probably stop at around three or four mostly. I think this may be the world's best beer. Just an opinion like something else. LOL.",4.45
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Refreshing, toasty and bitter at the same time. It has a strong baking cocoa kind of flavor and a pleasantly bitter char/smoke aftertaste, but the finish is crisp and clean, it's not heavy like I would have expected. Guinness is hit or miss for me but I really like this one!",4.38
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Guinness Extra Stout is in a class by itself. It's heavy and refreshingly light at the same time. It's not cloyingly thick, but clean. It has a wonderful roasted flavor--almost burnt--but not quite. I would say it has an almost dark chocolate sense about it.
On a cold winter day, this would be a great choice while sitting by the fire.",4.87

Medium bodied with high-ish carbonation giving some bite to a mostly smooth drink. Always a solid option.",3.95
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Look - 11.2 fl oz bottle, poured into a Guinness pint glass. dark brown in color, but transparent if you shine a light through it. big foamy three finger head with moderate retention and a lot of lacing.

Smell - some coffee, less dark chocolate, and heavily roasted malts. smells nice and hearty.

Taste - mild coffee-esque bitterness hits the tongue first, followed by light sweetness. black coffee flavor lingers in the finish, which is dry.

Feel - medium bodied, high carbonation, and a bit more boozy than the typical Irish stout at 5.6%.

Overall - relative to Guinness draught, this one is a bit more rough on the edges and packs a slight more punch, both of which I prefer. Happy St. Patrick's Day!",3.64

Dark brown tone, ample foam and sheets of lacing. Lasting surface coverage for the duration of the glass. Mild grainy aroma, very mild roast.

Unfortunately there were some acidity, papery oxidation, and oddly lactic notes. Mild raisin, vague roast and bitterness, not assertive or very flavorful. Fairly smooth, soft carbonation, lightly medium bodied.

A simple, bland stout, easy to drink. Not something i’ll seek out again, unless it’s any port in a storm situation.",3.29
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Look: Poured straight from a 11.2 oz bottle. Dark black pour - one of the darkest pours I've seen. Midnight black. A bit of foam depending the way you pour. Some lacing is hanging. quite like hanging Christmas lights up.
Smell: Smells of Chocolate, malts, coffee, maybe even a metallic smell as well.
Taste: Getting notes of stronger coffee even though the coffee isn't very strong compared to imperials - with some light chocolate. Light but noticable. Some malts as well.
Feel: Light bodied drink. Extremely easy to drink. smooth going down - almost can sip this as easily as water.
Overall: Not bad! This beer is world known and I'm glad to have given a review about my experience with it. If you follow what I've said just know this beer is great and definitely worth the try.",4.56
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Cooked up some Irish stew for dinner. Not super traditional, as I had no mutton so I subbed in beef and I also added carrots with the onion and potatoes, but either way it was absolutely delicious. Had some garlic bread too. Decided only a Guinness could go with this meal!

The look is gorgeous in the pint glass. It pours a roasted dark brown/almost black colour, compared to the ruby-ish lighter colour of the draught. Not nitro, so the head is tan/off-white, and lasts about 4-5 minutes but the lacing is good.

Smell was the most underwhelming aspect of this beer. It’s fairly classic, dark roast malts and a strong coffee aroma. But the taste is where it truly shines.

Stouts are my first and truest love, so I’ll be honest. Not sure if I got the freshest, best batch in the world or if other reviews are off, but this was phenomenal. It tastes incredibly roasted, almost slightly burnt at times, malty mocha savoury notes, very creamy, perfect amount of carbonation. Lasts very long in the tongue and mouth, exhaling toasty bready barley notes through your nose. Definitely more bitter than the draught, but not excessively so, the bitterness comes from the darkly roasted malt notes rather than a hoppy bitterness. The last notes after a sip, after they dissipate, is a light and sweet malt in the front of the tongue with mild toasty character in the back.

The benchmark for stouts, in my opinion! It’s somewhat straightforward compared to some others out there, but that’s okay. It’s classic Guinness flavour, doing what it does best, and I was absolutely floored by how good it was. Like I said, either I got a super fresh batch or something magical happened, but this was phenomenal!",3.82
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Guinness' are so distinctive, pitch black with a creamy head

Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Drinking it out of the bottle. Good taste, not as flat as the draft of the same. Way better than IPAs. Continuing my quest to find the perfect beer, it’s a snipe hunt, but journey is entertaining. Next stop is Pilsner Urquell. You should see the crazy selection at the tiny grocery up street in small town. Crazy selection. Like the 5.3 % alcohol.

This is probably not a summer day beer. But great in winter. Cheers!",3.98
Guinness Extra Stout (Original),"Poured from 11.2oz glass bottle
The look is fantastically dark doesnt let any light through. A tan head that's fine on top bit through the glass the bubbles look larger farther down. This is a traditional CO2 brew only draught is nitro. But the head retention is epic and leaves a layer of foamy head even after sitting for over 15 minutes of slow drinking (and forgetting about it) heavy heavy lacing.

The smell is rich with vanilla and roasty bitterness, maybe some light coffee notes. The fermentation character is present but subtle and there is a light tartness on the nose. Overall creamy and sweet smelling though.

Flavor mostly follows the smell but with more almost savory roasty notes from the malt very smooth and enjoyable, but not very sweet as should be expected from guiness. Some bitterness from the hops bit nothing major just offering balance. Some of that fermentation character does come through slightly as well but not very noticeable. Almost too easy to drink bit very enjoyable.

Feel is creamy yet smooth and very easy to put down not watery and is a bit thick but still quite drinkable. If it came in cans you might be able to shotgun it (but it doesnt) quite a lot of flavor for that though.

Overall a good everyday stout that gives you more than a macro but not to much to be something you cant put down at a party or offend peoples tastebuds with something unfamiliar.",3.86
Crème Brûlée,"Poured into a chalice: color is black, head is light tan and presents with the nitro super fine bubbles on that initial pour.

Smell is lightly boozy upfront, quickly overtaken by the creaminess - big lactose, really has that creamy aroma, some backing chocolate and roast.

Taste is similar but the booziness is a backing flavor: big cream, lactose, lighter chocolate, some roast, booze. Flavor really emanates a thick cocktail like flavor.

Mouthfeel is low nitro effervescence, strong/thick creamy sweetness, limited bitterness and even limited drying from the strength.

Overall a big, creamy sweet brew that gives off a creamy cocktail vibe (white russian-esque).",4.0
Crème Brûlée,"This is just sweeter than the hot cocoa one but that's really about the whole super prevalent difference. I feel like trying this one made me like them both a little less. Sweet, boozy, run of the mill. Southern Tier is super overrated as a whole to me. There's great desert beers and pastry stouts everywhere. Try something new. I will say this shits on their ipas in the since these are better at being stouts than the ipas are at being ipas. At least this is supposed to be sweet.",3.84
Crème Brûlée,"Experience says that this is among the best of the desert beers. Now it's time for a critical review. Two twelve ounce cans are opened and all of the contents of one and most of the contents of the second can are fitted instead a clear glass Imperial pint mug. There's an amazing vanilla smell in the air and the beige head, preventing the entire drainage of the second can, is one of the tightest and enduring in the beer world. It adorns a beautiful black coffee colored liquid that's opaque, but reasonably bright. Behind the sharp vanilla nose hit, found is creamy sweetness, kind of like the smell gotten from an aerosol whipped cream. For its color, there's very little reference to roasted malt. There is some roasted malt bitterness in the taste. So much so that it detracts from the intended target. But, it's a mild infraction, as there's enough smooth and creamy character to carry most of the taste. Actually the stout bitterness doesn't really kick until the finish. Until then, this is an amazing liquid reminder of a pleasantly sweet desert, without the crusty covering. There's great glass lacing and a well disguised 10% ABV. Maybe not perfect, but this is one great desert beer.",4.62
Crème Brûlée,"650 ml bottle, as Southern Tier Imperial Crème Brûlée Stout, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 10.0%. Pitch black colour, big tan head. Intense aroma of crème brûlée and vanilla from the moment you open the bottle, amazing! The smell includes caramel, of course - but also chocolate and mild coffee. The sweet flavour is first and foremost crème brûlée again, but also roasty notes of strong coffee, dark bitter chocolate and liquorice. Also some hoppy bitterness in the finish. Warming mouthfeel. An incredible dessert beer!",4.05
Crème Brûlée,"Looks: At 9.6 ozs. should have poured it into a smaller glass. LOL. Nice thick creamy head about 1/2 inch tall. Great lacing on the glass. Smooth tan on top and strong black coffee color on the bottom.
Smell and Taste: This beer really does resemble Creme Brûlée. Vanilla, and burnt sugar on cream. Great combination.
Feel: Nitro makes it smooth and soft.
Overall: This its one of the easiest beers I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. Bumped the OA score down some because of the short pour. Should have ben packaged in a can the size of a pint. At least it would have come closer to filling my glass. I would definitely drink this one again but as an after dinner drink, like desert.",4.45
Crème Brûlée,"Pours a cola brown color with a very creamy beige head, 1/4” cap was present for the duration.

Nose is seriously sweet with caramel, brown sugar, sweet cream and vanilla bean.

Flavor begins with caramel and vanilla, roasted coffee flavor comes on to offer some balance. Boozy alcohol warmth plays in the background the whole time.

Finish leans toward the bitter from the coffee, the sweetness and alcohol warmth are still there though.

Viscous body and subtle carbonation let this one hang on the palate a little, but it’s a desert beer in every way, so this wasn’t surprising.

Not a daily drinker, good to keep a few on hand for the colder months though.",3.83
Crème Brûlée,"Pours quite dark and fairly clear, appropriate head. Aroma is dark roasted malts and vanilla.

Crème Brûlée,"The initial smell is quite nice. But then you take a sip. Utterly disgusting. I tried a second can, same. The sheer number of positive reviews required me to sign up and leave a review. I'm still trying to get the after taste out of my mouth. Absolutely do not recommend.",2.21
Crème Brûlée,"I wish I could give these folks a ZERO but its not an option. The Creme Brûlée beers were over pressurized and for the first 3 packs of 4 beers, I opened them over the sink as they would fizz on opening. The beer was in an area with no sun and a constant 69 degrees. A few days ago 3 beers of a four pack exploded. The tops pushed up and blew off. One top severed completely where the flat and round part of the can connect. Two of those cans shot 20 feet into my home spraying beer as they traveled. The third shot upwards to the ceiling. It was a 5 hour clean up job and we are still finding areas we missed and hand washing items that had to be rack dried to remove stale, very sugary, beer. Calling friends, family and my boss to tell them to remove the gifted beer from their home was amusing. The manager where I bought them said Southern Tier had other recalls on their nitros for the same reason so BUYER BEWARE. I called the company and left a message for quality control to call me. That was three days ago and nothing. Clearly Southern Tier does not care about customer service or their customers experience with their product. Had they called back to discuss the issue I would continue to buy their beer. Instead, they have lost a customer for life. There are just too many other good brews out there that I can try instead.",1.0

S: horribly, pied-piper-ly, artificially, caramel-vanilla latte ice cream-scented candle smell - super, stupid potent, but rather Coffee-Mate quality (I recently reviewed a beer where the CM fakery was well-nigh suffocating; this may have usurped its ugly stranglehold)...

T: rather artificial, fake flavor renderings; coffee, creme, vanilla wafer... this ain't beer... an alcoholic (and deceptively so) Young's Double Choco Stout (or that barely-palatable Wells Sticky Toffee crud) violently-injected with vanilla Coffee Mate and pungent piney shrubs... mellow roasty, near-tannic bitterness lingering long

F: unsurprisingly satiny-smooth, quiet caress... mellow spicy booze activity, silky sedation in its finish... admittedly easy to slug (destroy), heaven forbid one has this at a bar while socializ-ising - too dangerously slammable

O: mercifully, my last review of the day (and I haven't yet weighed in on any of the 12 4 oz tasters at Weyerbacher midday)... had this years ago in a bomber (and/or on tap?!), but got mad confused review-wise as to whether or not I'd done it, eh?... insanely full-flavored - and of a quality of which I most nostalgically associate with Southern Tier... gotta 3- or 4-way share even a small can of this, good god (1620)",3.81
Crème Brûlée,"Poured out of a 12 oz bottle in to a pint glass, this beer pours a very dark brow, almost black color with a tan head that's about half an inch thick when first poured.

Aromas of roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars. The taste is pretty much the same, with roasted malts with a bit of caramel, vanilla and chocolate along with some milk sugars for a bit of additional sweetness.

Next stop, Goose Island. Continuing on with my Chicago beer escapade, I just had to stop at this legendary brewery for some good beers here and to go. Let’s see what their classic Saision is all about

Pours a cloudy yellow gold with 2 fingers of creamy off white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

There’s not much funk or tartness to the nose as I tend to prefer in the style, but the earthy vibe is still quite nice. I’m picking up on aromas of white pepper, lemon zest, white tea, crackery malt, tannic white wine, wildflower honey, pear skin, and earthy wheat

Likewise in taste it is more just straight earth than funk, and again still good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting lemon zest, crackery malt, wildflower honey, white tea, peppery hops, apple skin, and light toast. The swallow brings notes of clove, bready malt, white grape, honey, peppery hops, pear skin, and a touch of vanilla

A light medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a crisp and sharp beer. Finishes mostly dry and refreshing

There is an abundant amount of carbonation to watch parade to the top. The half inch of fluffy white head did recede to a thin cap after several minutes.
The aroma is quite noticeable from a distance. For starters there is a sweet fruity citrus, I am leaning toward notes of orange. There is a pleasant yeast and wheat mixture happening also.
The wheat is the first thing I am picking up, a little yeast, then the orange peel. The finish is slightly bitter, a tad dry, with a bump of pepper spice.

It's a light amber liquid, really not much different in color than most lagers. There is a bit more opaqueness than lagers generally have. A nice modest and enduring white head is included. The glass lacing is even less. The smell is vaguely yeasty and perhaps a little perfume-llke. The taste is yeasty and perfume-llke, but mildly refreshing. It certainly is much lighter in feeling and taste than an IPA. Not everyone will appreciate that as a good thing. Orange peel is included in the mix. It's there, but not a heavy influence on the taste. Probably it adds to a dry bitterness that shows at the finish. That part is well done, for without it, this could be a yeasty mess. There's no evidence this has an ABV above five percent other than to read it on the label. Probably average for the style, this isn't going to convert a hop loving DIPA devotee.

Sofie,I'm not a fan of this style but I am a fan of Goose Island. I should have trusted my instincts. Pours pale and chunky. Has a nice tart aroma. Tastes like week champagne. Has a nice malt finish but the beginning and middle ruin it. Hard pass.,3.52
Sofie,"Presentation: 12 oz. brown bottle with the bottling date printed on the back. Served in a tulip glass.

Appearance: The bright white, one finger head stays around for a while and leaves behind a lot of lacing that covers the entire glass. It's a slightly hazy, bright gold color.

Smell: There's a slight citrus aroma first followed by some fruity bubblegum and a touch of yogurt funk in the background.

Taste: Slightly tart with some lemon and a soft flowery note right after.

Mouthfeel: Light, crisp and refreshing with high carbonation

Overall: A good enough beer that's refreshing and easy to drink. There's some complexity but not much to write home about.",3.56
Sofie,"Cloudy, gold pour with a finger width of dense, white head. Strong orange peel followed by bread dough and apricot (?) on the nose. Similar taste, but perhaps more lemon than orange peel and darker tree fruits with yeast, herbs, and cracked white pepper. Slight coating in the mouth. One of my favorite beers!",4.51
Sofie,"765ml bottle. Label is stamped with bottling date of '22SEP17'. Label says ""DEVELOPS IN THE BOTTLE OVER 5 YEARS"".
Cloudy, straw colored body. Just a brief fizzy head upon pouring. Only a couple of spots of lacing are left behind.
Aroma is yeast esters, pepper, and orange citrus.
Taste is yeast esters, orange zest, and a touch of white wine. Overall impression from the esters is leather and hay. For spices pepper and cloves come to mind. Dry at the end with a short lived after taste.
Medium mouth feel, with effervescence. Excellent carbonation.
Very refreshing, lighter summer ale that works year round. I would think the yeast flavors will change depending upon the time in the bottom.",4.13
Triple (White),"Poured at fridge temp. Unknown bottling date as I can't find anything that resembles a date on the bottle. Pours a beautiful orange with fluffy white head. Some murky and definitely opaque. The nose is orange creamsicle, bread, wheat, a floral note, and some grass. Very malty and wonderful.

The taste is amazing. Sweet toffee, maple, bready malts, cereal, lemon, orange, a bit of vanilla, slight hoppy bitterness, an earthy note, and a significant floral note. Great balance between sweet fruit/toffee and bitter hops. Wonderful.

Mouthfeel is fairly light and crisp. A bit on the dry side. Overall, a fantastic tripel!",4.31
Triple (White),"2 inch white, billowing, creamy, thick head with very good retention, that leaves sticky lacing around the glass and forms a rocky, uneven surface as it does recede. Hazy golden amber with very active carbonation.

Strong aroma; I can smell it while pouring. Bready, light fruit, and spice. Sweet-ish.

The initial taste carries indistinct fruit - pear, perhaps, bread, floral, and peppery spice. A solid bitterness begins in the middle, along with some citrus, and continues into the finish and aftertaste. This is the most bitter of any tripel so far for me. The finish brings a bit of an earthy character. The level of bittering is in APA territory, which I was not expecting. In fact, the package of flavors, with the citrus, floral, and bitterness, is more APA than any of the other Belgian-style tripel ales I had. It is very tasty, but certainly different from others in the style. While the aroma seemed to promise sweetness, the finish is quite dry.

Mouth feel has a moderate body with the carbonation bubbles active on my tongue.

Overall, a tasty beer, nothing out of balance, but a bit of an outlier in the company of the other Belgian tripels. It definitely brings more from the hops (citrus and bitterness) than do the others.",4.07
Triple (White),"Lovely surprise. 33ml bottle purchased at grocery store in Belgium. Poured into IKEA 8 oz. glass. Surprisingly light, spicier and hoppier than I expected, and while you can tell there's a lot of malt involved, crisp, not sweet. Very smooth drinking and no alchohol heat - wouldn't guess it's a tripel. Not a lot of depth, but has the distinctive Belgian yeast banana-y flavors. A fastball right down the middle — nothing fancy, but a very nice example of the style. In the upper range of the 20-odd Belgians sampled this week.",4.43
Triple (White),"330 ml. bottle stamped L20-274, poured into a Belgian chalice.
Copper colored with scant fine white head. No lacing, small surface ring. This seems unusual, and may be the result of age or mishandling.

Triple (White),"Sampling a 330cl bottle at cellar temp poured into my chalice. Picked up at a beer shop two weeks ago and in my cellar since then. L20-540 on the label is closest to a date stamp I can find.
The beer pours a rich copper color with lots of fine suspended sediment floating around. A fluffy dense head of bleached white foam rises up 2 cm and almost overflows the glass. This foam sticks around as a sturdy surface covering and leaves dense lattice on the sides of my glass. this lattice clings on throughout the tasting.
Aroma is some bready malts and fruity pear notes with a bit of general spiciness, never any booze notes.
First sip reveals a medium body with soft and gentle carbonation.
Flavor is some bready malt, green apple and pears and a bit of sweeter spices, maybe coriander. This isnt cloying or a candy sweet beer but Im not getting any sort of bite from hops nor peppery ABV. I just drank Allagash Tripel before this one and found these to be fairly different beers.",4.13

S - Light bready / cracker malts. Some heavy spice along with hops.

T - A mix of malt and dry hops. A good mix of light malt and light bitterness. The floral taste hops have a little sourness. The bitterness is more pronounced as you drink.

F - Medium-to-thin mouthfeel. Foamy carbonation.

O - Overall this is a fine beer, but tried it immediately after the Chimay Blue, and this Chimay White was not as well-liked. I’m glad I tried it and would recommend it to people looking for a tasty light hoppy beer, but I’m not going to add it to my rotation.",3.68
Triple (White),"Pours a hazy, amber colour. Even with the most careful of pours, a three finger tight and dense head appears, with another finger tall rocky, foamy head. This is my usual glass goblet, but I don’t know what happened, tons of bubbles are running up all over little spots on the glass. As if there were nucleation points on the side, which there isn’t. As I waited to pour the rest of the beer in, I realized… the head is not collapsing. Not after 5 minutes, not after 15, and not even through the whole half hour I drank this beer. Something happened I’ve never seen before which is that the head actually grew in the initial minutes of the pour and the rocky foamy head coalesced into the middle of the glass like an actual mountain. I don’t know if this was just some crazy unique thing, but it’s so gorgeous looking I honestly want to give it my first ever 5.

Sweet, delicious doughy yeast on the nose. Caramel malts, tasty spices such as pepper, coriander, a hint of cinnamon. A bit of banana and cloves here too. Sugared apricot for the fruity notes. It’s a Belgian, and even more it’s an abbey beer, they just always smell so good.

Taste follows the nose and then some. It is not disappointing at all. There is more balancing hop bitterness here than other Tripels, not citrusy, but a little bit grassy, funky and floral. Doughy yeast and moist, chewy bread flavours are unbelievably pleasant. Tripels and Quads can aim for a few different categories, some have those fruity esters like Westmalle, some aim for the sweet malt rum raisin flavours like Abt 12. Chimay White aims for a pleasant balance. There isn’t as much raisin, rum, dark fruit flavour here however, as the floral and mildly funky, wheaty malts balancing the sweetness and bitterness is more this beers thing. Gentle spices dance throughout the sip as well, mostly cloves. Mild funk adds a slightly savouriness to the beer. Toffee, caramel, and dried candy fruit rinds can also be tasted.

Pleasant and subtle finish that is dry in character, this beer is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Bittersweet on the palate as it dries.

Chimay White occupies a unique space in the Tripel category, but definitely deserves to be ranked higher. It stands out from the crowd and has its own little niche of flavours, enough to stand beside other unique tripels like Westmalle, Tripel Karmeliet, Rochefurt, etc. It’s not quite as malty and sweet as others, but still has pleasant chewy doughiness to it. It doesn’t have the deep molasses, rum, raisin character either, nor does it have tons of fruity esters. It’s very balanced and yet despite that still carries strong notes of its own character.

As for all Belgian Abbey tripels, it’s phenomenal. You really can’t ever go wrong with these brewers in this style!",4.26

Triple (White),"Pours a cloudy, deep amber coloration with a large, creamy head. Smells of caramel malt, toffee, estery/hoppy fruit with notes of apricot, apple and citrus, as well as hints of estery spice. Taste is a perfect balance of caramel malt, toffee, estery fruit and spice, with notes of red apple, apricot, clove and cardamon, as well as some bitter, citrus hops, with notes of orange rind. Finishes bittersweet, with a light/medium bitterness and some toffee, citrus and estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Full mouthfeel with a medium/rich body and medium carbonation.

While I love Tripel Karmeliet, this has got to be my new favorite Tripel. The balance of malt, hops and yeast is just absolutely superb here, with some sweet caramel malt and toffee, bitter and citrussy hops, as well as fruity and spicy notes that complement each other incredibly well. I really like how prominent the hops are here, with some citrus notes and a good bitterness that prevents this from becoming too sweet against the rich caramel malt backdrop, while those fruity esters really stand out as well, with a good spiciness and great body and mouthfeel as well.",4.67

Triple (White),"Managed to avoid the current and recent reviews :)

Personally, I love the smoothness and balance of Chimay beers, they are some of the best.

I hope this is good, before I have had only blue and red :)

Beautiful orange amber colour, shines in the light, good froth level, that stays.

Deep, fruit and spice aroma. Apricot prominent. Seriously deep and mystical.

Very citrussy. Really overpowering, though also enjoyably intense. Better than Delirium Tremens as it has much more levels of flavour. Also, better than Duvel for the same reason. The balance of elements is mastered at a much higher level, this is a truly complex flavour on the tongue. The fizziness lasts for about a minute, and constantly changes taste. This is more than just a beer..! It is a creation of pure elegance and complexity.

Is there a bit too much bitterness and orange peel flavour..? For some people, yes. It really depends on one's tastebuds.

It does have elements of Duvel. Though it takes to a new level. However Duvel limited edition tripel that I had a few weeks ago is as good as this, though more apricotty.

For me Chimay are the best Belgian Trappiste brewers by far. Blue is still my favourite ; )",4.48

This starts out as the All-American stout: bitter, coffee-driven, big, clean, and dangerously easy.
But licorice is a strange choice of adjuncts. On top of that, over multiple tastings, quite a few dark fruity (ester?) notes come out as it warms. Is this recipe old enough to date from when US breweries were aping English styles? That would explain a lot.
In the end, strong roast cuts across it all. This scratches the itch for anyone looking for something punchy. But would something this idiosyncratic would ever come out today?

I like this as a sessionable beer, substantial yet sippable, flavorful yet not too demanding... it checks off the necessary stout characteristics, and though it may not do any of them excellently, it combines them into a quality product...",3.94
Kalamazoo Stout,"12 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at 40 degrees F, and allowed to warm during consumption.

L: Pours a deep inky black, because, well, stout. Forms a half-finger of pale tan head that vanishes swiftly to a ring.

S: Chocolate and coffee notes dominate the nose, with an underlying backbone of loam and some faint tobacco hints. As it warms, the nose remains similar.

T: The taste follows the nose rather well, at least while refrigerated. Cold coffee and cocoa, with some loamy and tobacco notes. As the beer warms, a rather large bitter ash/pine presence swells up out of the background to claim center stage and hurl everything else into the background - apparently a hop presence that overwhelms my odd palate. Alas.

F: Full and thick, like drinking a warmed syrup.

O: While cold, I enjoy this stout. As it warms and the hop presence manifests, I unfortunately am not as able to enjoy it. Ah well. Please take my taste and overall scoring numbers in reference to the particulars of my palate - though as I enjoy other hefty IBU stouts like Old Rasputin, I feel validated in actually rating and scoring.",3.21

L - Dark brown/black, 1-2 fingers of light tan head which settles down to a 1cm thick layer which is unusually dense that sticks around, sticks to the glass very thickly with fine lacing. Beautiful.

S - Dark roasted malt, brown sugar and caramel, with the tiniest bit of licorice in there, no hops that I can spot. Solid stout bouquet.

T - Smoke and blackened malt with very dark chocolate, small but sharp hop profile, licorice is nowhere to be found, the flavor is all somewhat muted actually, almost like everything has been watered down. Feeling pretty letdown here.

M - Medium-heavy body, carbonation is moderate, at least it does drink like a real stout

Kalamazoo Stout,"A very nice looking beer pours pitch black, and dense. I did not expect the slowly rising head you get on bigger stouts one a 6 % one but that’s exactly what happened. A slow to rise creamy mocha tan looking head. Then it settles into rocky terrain creamy froth. As I stated a very nice looking beer.

The aroma to me is big in burnt and roasty. The things that come to mind for me are dark chocolate and dark roast black coffee. Also get a touch of something licorice like.

Tastes is nice burnt dark roast coffee. It also reminds me of those dark chocolates that are high up in the cocoa %. I’d even say there is almost like a burnt tobacco thing going on.

Medium bodied but super smooth. It’s almost creamy because of the carbonation. Very nice big bitter lingering finish. I swear it’s almost like smoking a cigarette with coffee aftertaste. I haven’t had a cigarette in ages but you know you can never get that taste to leave. That’s what this beer does but in a good way.",4.17

Deep brown body, totally opaque. Smell is a bit of licorice, moderate and not overpowering. Taste is malty in the background, some bitter chocolate and coffee, and ending with an aftertaste of hops. Drinkable, but really not my kind of stout with the bitterness and hops. Not quite medium bodied, moderate bite of carbonation. Drinkable, but just not my style.",3.51
Kalamazoo Stout,"Appearance:
An impressive, double finger of creamed mocha froth floats steadily on a lake of imperturbable black. But while the head is twice as strong, retention is half as long. What little lace it offers comes in jilted, broken webbing.

Bouquet:
Chestnuts and sips of black coffee hiding in a vast field of dark grains. Hops appear and disappear on the horizon, too distant to rightly identify. While crossing that grain field, straining to get a closer look at those hops, you'll sometimes trip over a gnarled root of baker’s chocolate.

Feel:
Slender and supple, like tucking the tongue under a cooling bedsheet. A low yet continual presence of breezy bubbles brings the hidden hops forward during the linger.

Taste:
Reallllly subtle toasted dark malts speckled with droplets of silky, chocolate milk and topped with crushed chestnuts. A lick of licorice bitters and herbal hops chase away the sugar, maintaining the manly lineage a traditional stout should boast: smooth, roasty, and mildly bitter.

Overall:
Exceedingly mild, the casual drinker may have trouble tasting anything other than “dark beer.” A good starter stout for the uninitiated.",3.79

Upon opening, an earthy, hoppy, slightly metallic smell greets the nostrils. The brew pours dark, and forms a respectable mocha colored head, which modestly laces as you consume. The taste is good.. a bit overly hoppy to my taste buds, but the hops, and malt form a tangible licorice note atop the chocolate and coffee blend expected from a good stout. The mouthfeel is nice, substantial but not sticky.. this stout goes down smoothly, It tastes better as you go.. I'm looking forward to my second one, already. We have a winner here!",3.86

Color is super dark brown that doesn't let any light through, even at the edges. Head is relatively dark, like a chocolate mousse, and the carbonation is fine.

Smell has a lot of prunes, and it's fairly floral. Slightly metallic. I hope I didn't let it sit too long.

Maybe I did. Prunes are still there, and there's lots of charred barrel. Some vague red wine grape, too. Any chocolate is not from the usually eaten part of the plant, more like tree nut husks. I might have a better impression if I was having it with barbecue. Yeah, there's oak, but it doesn't stand well as a flavor in this brew.

Alcohol is pretty well hidden, and the weight is medium for type. Aftertaste is metal and charred wood. Carbonation is fine, but prickly with a swish around the mouth.",4.02

Finish is somewhat bitter and a little astringent. Not my favorite Imperial Stout by a long shot, but not bad.",3.84
Oak Aged Yeti Imperial Stout,"Just when I thought I had reviewed every Yeti out there, here comes one I haven't. Man these have been around, 10 years ago, these were pretty highly sought. Don't hear much these days, but that shouldn't take away from the beer's goodness. Pours a rich black with 2/3"" brown head. Aroma hits the standard roasted and chocolate malt combo along with a sturdy presence of oak on it. Did not know it was both french and American, would say the American is the stronger of the two in this beer, whereas usually french is more noticeable for me. Definitely fits the ""oaky"" descriptor either way.

Taste has a nice touch of chocolate to it despite having no chocolate in it. The roasted malt is so pervasive that you get a coffee like component despite having no coffee. Good brewing technique and ingredients there. The oak remains pronounced, the bitterness is real, the alcohol is relatively innocuous taste wise despite almost being 10%. Solid chewy mouth feel throughout.

Its a good beer, should be interesting to see if it survives as bombers have fallen from grace, I believe they moved the base version into a 4 pack, so who knows what the future holds for this beer that probably deserves to be in the Hall of Fame at this point.",4.04

T - After that aromatic introduction the flavors follow quite well, add some tannin's from the barrel, black pepper, a touch of anise
M - Large feel, rich and bold, starts semi sweet, transitions to a softer feel, bitterness is a theme, the finish is luxurious,
lingering on the cocoa meets bourbon date.
O - Glad to have experienced this with a few years of rest, the feel connotes dessert, the slightly boozy tends to the adult side of our desires. Well worth seeking out, I will try a fresh version against the last 2015 bottle I have resting comfortably. This will be a nice taste test",4.16

Note: this beer is 2 years old and still tastes great - the hops were much more pronounced when it was fresh, still a great beer.

Wookey Jack,"(Written July 23rd, 2015) My first Review!

22OZ bomber. When I bought this it was sitting in a refrigerated cooler at a grocery store, and the date on it was 12/19/14 (at over 7 months old); my guess is, being chilled, it retained most if not all of it’s hopped flavor. It was a very good beer, with lots of hop flavor, and a very heavy mouth-feel. It poured very dark, with a nice, light, caramel-colored head. It is one of the better (if not one of the best) IPA type beers I have had.",3.97
Wookey Jack,"Firestone Walker Brewing Co. ""Wookey Jack""
12 fl. oz. brown glass bottle, ""BOTTLED ON: 01/05/16"" so a year and 5 months old
$3.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness; A friend of mine introduced me to Wookey Jack about a year ago. He had a 6-pack at one of his parties and I ended up drinking almost the whole thing. It immediately became one of my favorite beers. I love that it's hoppy, but not so much so that the malt can't compete, and that the rye shows clearly; and looking at what I've got in front of me, given that it's well over a year old, it's surprisingly hoppy - I could smell the hops when I opened the bottle. Anyway, I'm not sure when this was discontinued but I haven't been able to find it - I'm sure there are fresher bottles around, in fact this one from Total Wine & More was probably bottled before the ones that I got from my friend! I bought it anyway, despite the price, because I like it that much; and to be honest, upon tasting it now the malt has held up extremely nicely as well. There's a touch of oxidation there, sure, but it's not bad, I'm still enjoying it. All of the dark chocolate is there, the softer fudge-like and caramel notes, the roastiness, the spice from the rye, and the pine and citrus from the hops - and if there's one thing that's missing it's that the citrus seems to have waned a little. Oh man, I'm going to miss this one. Hopefully I'll come across some that's been discounted and I can buy up the lot. I said before that if the new Leo v. Ursus beers were all as good as the Forte it would be worth it to discontinue some others, but sitting here with one in my hand I doubt that. This is the best black rye IPA that I've ever tasted, and probably one of my top 10 favorites - or at least one of my top 10 favorite dark beers, that's definite. A moment of silence. ... ... ... Wookey Jack, you will be missed.",4.38
Wookey Jack,"The appearance has a black body with a three finger off-white foamy head, leaves some clingy slightly foamy lacing in rings. The smell has some slightly roasted coffee. There is some rye, slight citrus/pine coming through in a spicy sort of way. The taste is mainly bitter, some slight coffee - but mainly subdued, hopped - yes, but balanced and extremely flavorful. There is a dry yet bittersweet aftertaste and finish. On the palate, its about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable - maybe perhaps, and the ABV slightly felt. Overall, I’d say this is very good for a Black Ale and I would come back to this.",3.99
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Very dark, like looking into a dark-glass bottle of red wine. Head dissipates quickly but leaves lots of long-lasting lacing. On the nose, immediate smell of ketchup and then sherry vinegar, hints of toast, levels out into some metallic scents and aromas reminiscent of tannic red wine. Flavor seems less complex, red wine aromas are not reflected much here. Tart and sour, again very much like sherry vinegar. Though flavor is very strong it is light in the mouth. Sourness leaves a little tingle as you breath out through the nose. Sweetness and metallic notes present well into the finish. Carbonation seems lower (which I like). Good experience but not to be drank regularly.",3.97
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"750ml bottle into a tulip. Couldn't find any dating.

Looks magnificent in the glass. Deep dark ruby red body, crystal clear when held up to the light. Off white head is replenished by carbonation and leaves layers of lacing.

Aroma is a little musty.

On tasting, it's quite well balanced, slightly more to the sweet side. Goes down very easy. Notes of dark berry fruit, red wine.

Mouth medium, finish fruity and a little drying.

Overall, an enjoyable drink. Tart, sweetness, and sour all seem to blend into each other, each occasionally rising to the top before falling away.",4.07
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Only notable note to form a complain is vinegary after taste, but even that is balanced and elevated with sour and sweetness, and salt. This beer must be a fluke, no one can do this well if they try.",4.91
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Dark reddish-brown body, clear; excellent carbonation; moderate sized, lasting head; dense and spongy. Pleasing aroma of cherry with a mild, general sourness. Outstanding taste; initial lightly sweet malt flavor; caramel; sour cherries. Heavy body; soft and spongy; light acidity.

I have been holding on to this one for a while. Despite being a few months past its suggested best before date, the beer drinks surprisingly easily. The blending of sweetness and sourness is superb, while the mildly toasted malt adds an excellent level of depth and complexity.

Pouring temperature: 56 °F; bottling data: Best before 2021-11-26",4.18
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Poured semi vigorous, was late getting phone and head had dissipated to what you see now. It is actually pretty appealing though, a nice dark brown/red hued color with a creamy ring around the glass. Some floaties hanging out too.

Smell is interesting and very unique...I keep getting all sorts of different smells each time. First it was all acetic, the came some tart cherry, then I got a weird funky note that almost reminded me of cheese, yes its definitely there, but it only shows itself every now and then; last note grape skin. At this point I'm very curious what this one tastes like...

Wow, that is certainly not what the nose told me it would be. Sure the sour and acetic are there but it is actually a lot sweeter than I would've ever expected. It is almost like cherry candy at first that quickly goes tart, reminds me of sour patch kids in reverse. There is also some baking spice notes that were no where to be found on the nose. I didn't pick up on oak initially but it does show itself in the aftertaste fo rme.

Mouthfeel is medium, typical belgian carbonations, a beautiful combination of both sweet and mouth puckering sour; they mingle on the tongue in perfect balance.

Trying Belgian beers like this is always a treat for me. I don't drink them often but every time I do it seems I find myself being taken on a sensory trip all over the place. So many different aromas, then tastes and all always balanced in such a perfect way.",4.04
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Pours a deep dark amber-cherry colour, the light carbonation at first might fool you as it grows into a two inch bubbly head, that collapses into a persisting one inch, soft fluffy head that lasts well over ten minutes. The lacing is off the charts on my tulip glass

While many beers have that citrus zest smell on the nose, Duchesse has much more of a juicy smell instead. Dark cherries and malt are strongest here, Oak-y wine like must smells swirl around as well.

Those wine like notes are up front for sure, the sourness is a light, tart cherry, and general fruitish notes (green apple, blackberries, oh, and wine grapes of course with that sourish thick skinned vinous chew). Nice subtle long finish, the malt backbone lasts the longest, and the gentle sourness finishes very sweet.

Disagree with the review(s) that said it was one dimensional. This absolutely opens up, not just as the beer warms, but on the sip as well. The Oaky, wine, grape must notes are strong at first with the sweet sourness before opening up with some dark cherry notes. Mouth watering at this stage. And yet, it finishes dry and you get the real malty sweetness, notes of apple, blackberries, maybe raspberries but I’d at least say general juicy tart fruits.

Soft carbonation that creates a gentle sip that goes down easy, but enough lasting carbonation to support a head that collapses into a thick fluffy one inch line that lasts almost the entire duration of the drink. Gentle sour notes pucker the tongue slightly before opening up.

I haven’t had many Flanders red ales or lambics, krieks, etc in a long time so I can’t say this is a benchmark, but it certainly feels like it. Overall the looks, tastes, smells of this beer are gorgeous and it’s not overwhelming on any one area to scare anyone off. If you want a beer that goes hard in any direction I’m sure you could find it, but Duchesse de Bourgogne has the balance and yet complexity to absolutely satisfy, a gorgeous well priced sour",4.33
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"On tap at Whole Foods.

A - Pours a vibrant cherry color with no lacing and no carbonation. Not much life in this glass but maybe the CO2 on the tap line isn't set correctly?

S - Really nice, tart cherry, black cherry aroma with a slight bit of juiciness on the nose and a delicate amount of sour twang.

T - Cherry from start to finish with a puckering, tart sweetness on the back side.

M - Slight puckering big body that's silky soft and leaves the mouth watering.

O - This is a really fantastic beer and highly recommended for the style.",4.3
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"L-A real pretty reddish brown pour. Approximately 2 fingers worth of a light amber head. A real nice color combination.
S-Nice fruity smell with a hint of oak. The malt and hops also come through.
T-At first sip there’s a fruity and sweet taste, but then a real pleasant sour after taste comes through that provides a nice balance to this beer.
F-Real smooth
O-When I first took a sip of this beer I was totally surprised because I never tasted any beer quite like this. But the more I drank it the more it grew on me. This is a very unique and well blended beer. When you’re in the mood to try something different I recommend giving this beer a try.
PS: This beer went really well with the ham we had for Christmas!!",4.33
Duchesse De Bourgogne,"Purchased as a 28-ounce tall bottle at The Fresh Market for $14.90. Poured into a tulip glass.

L - Ruby/mahogany with a one-finger dark eggshell head. Incredibly beautiful lacing; coats the sides of the glass.
S - Merlot grapes, leather, and cherry. Oak. Legitimately smells of a good red wine.
T - Cherry, dates, and grape on the front. Oak and tannin notes throughout, with a charred oak base. Finish is tart and juicy, and left on a slightly bitter berry note. On the sweeter side at first, it turns well-balanced as you progress down the glass.
F - Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Silky and juicy. Satisfying finish.
O - Though my ratings may differ, this is my new favorite beer. Wine-like sans the snobby, this is a perfect pairing to my Thanksgiving meal. If I were to have one beer before I died, I'd be honored for this to be the one. I cannot recommend this enough. Will purchase again.",4.96

S: Sour, over-ripe apple skins, vinegar, cherry, red wine tannins, red wine cork, leather, dark fruit.
T: Tart, sour, sharp acrid sweetness, full flavored dark fruits, oak wood cask, cranberry, cherries. It is fairly intense tasting and I do taste nuances of malt in the background towards the finish.
F: Medium-light bodied, lively with carbonation, acidic and moderately drying. It has an intense and compact mouthfeel that is puckering.

A: Pours an almost cola color in the glass but with hues varying from ruby to caramel when held to light. 2 fingers of dense light tan head build before dissipating down. Moderation retention and lots of lacing. 4.5

S: Aroma is tons of sweetness up front, moderate dark fruits, huge butterscotch, a bit caramely. Tartness is mild, but there is pretty prominent pungent cheese like funky notes. 4

T: Taste is just bursting with flavor, huge rich dark fruits, equally huge sweetness with tons of sugary caramel notes. There is tartness, but it’s not particularly prominent. No reply
funky notes at all. It does provide some balance but for the most part it’s a sweetness bomb which admittedly I find a bit surprising. I do get some oaky notes to round it out. Very good but almost too one dimensional which again I am shocked by. 4.25

M/D: Full bodied but not heavy, carbonation perfect, some mild puckering tartness made it more drinkable than it otherwise would be. 4.25

Vanilla Porter,"Poured from a 12oz can best by January 29th 2023

On the poured a khaki 2 finger head formed, then started slowly dissipating. Body is a dark brown that lets some red light through. Low carbonation and no lacing.

Smell is not very clean. Kind of smells like guinness and super cheap lager got together. Some vanilla and chocolate come through, but this smells kinda dirty.

Taste loses most if not all of the dirty beer vibe. Its a pretty traditional if not a bit average porter. Sweet and a bit vanilla-y so not bad but I wish it was smoother and maltier.

Feel is light for the style. Slightly mouthcoating, but it finishes dryer than expected. It honestly feels a bit conflicted. Not bad but this beer is all over the place.

Overall it's another Breck brewing beer. They really aren't my favorite brewery out there, but they aren't the worst. It's a dark beer that has almost nothing wrong with it, except for the fact that it's lacking identity. A vanilla dark beer that wants to be drinkable and a crowd pleaser but still coming off as craft, and sellable alenought that A-B can sell it nation wide.",3.35
Vanilla Porter,"Look: Dark red, no head

Smell: I can’t really describe it, but it smells good

Feel: Watery. Nice after taste

Overall: It’s fine, that it. Nothing more, nothing less.",2.8
Vanilla Porter,Pour a very effervescent dark copper with slightly less than a finger of head. The nose has mild vanilla notes. The vanilla is assertive in the flavor but there's not really a corresponding roast to counteract the sweetness of the adjunct.,3.55
Vanilla Porter,"From a can. Caramel color with a thin layer of tan colored head. Smells of roasted malt, a little faint. Medium body, well carbonated. Roasted malt and vanilla flavors. Exactly what the name promises.",3.53
Vanilla Porter,"Almost no scent when the cap comes off, this porter developed a nice tannish head but quickly lost it. The color is a very transparent reddish mahogany and is accompanied by the subtlest vanilla and a little cream... like the liquid accompanying a chocolate-covered cherry. The taste is totally vanilla, kind of like what my younger self imagined vanilla extract would taste like. It feels very much like a cream soda... round, easy to drink, and some carbonation going down. This is fine, I may get it again if in the mood for a lighter porter in warmer weather.",2.89
Vanilla Porter,"Look: Dark brown to black with a quickly dissipating tan head. Minimal lacing.

Smell: Vanilla with some light chocolate.

Taste: Very disappointing taste. The vanilla wasn't perceived whatsoever and left me with a horrible lingering aftertaste.

Feel: Medium to high carbonation.

Overall: Very disappointed with this one, particularly the taste. The vanilla wasn't at all noticeable and the flavor profile was unexceptional that left me with a bad aftertaste.",2.0
Duet,"Golden orange with chill haze and a one finger white head. Nose is orange, tangerine, and some sugar. Taste follows the nose with a nice bite of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine pith and flesh followed by a short hint of pale malt. Body is light to medium with similar carbonation. Ends with a bitter citrus nuttiness. Overall not a bright as I thought it would be but solid characteristics. Maybe an older can? Cans says best by 12/22/22 and I’m opening it 9/2/22. Not sure how old it is?",4.03
Duet,"A well balanced citrusy IPA with a mixture of Pine and cedar notes. Displays a lighter orange color with nice head and nice citrus aromas. From the first sip you can taste the citrus, which was soon followed by the pine. This beer paired well on a warm day and was easily followed by a second. Exactly what I remembered from a west coast IPA.",4.59
Duet,"Really solid beer. I had this one a few years back - it seems a bit different from what I remember or just what I expected in a West Coast IPA, but really a great beer. I have rounded my 'overall' up since my lower scores are probably more of a personal preference vs. a fault with the beer. I downgraded in the look and feel dept - looking ('hazy') and feeling ('juicy') like a NEIPA is not a positive for me. I was hoping for a crisper feel and clearer look. Nonetheless, I loved the foamy pour, the piney smell, and a real nice level of maltiness that tames the hoppy-ness. There's no doubt I would have this again.",4.14
Duet,"Old school West Coast IPA. Piney and bitter with some citrus elements, backed up by a silky, full mouthfeel. Pours a bright coppery orange with a thin, persistent head. It's possibly being overrated here due to the pleasure of drinking an actual West Coast IPA and the sentimentality of a beer style that first introduced me to craft beer (and which I forced down in horror at the hoppy bitterness of it all!).

Cheers",4.38
Duet,Very piney full ipa. Stronger flavor than most. Too much of a piney after taste for my liking. 1 is enough. All around the taste is good strong but the aftertaste is what lessens the score for me. I am a bigger fan of the Nelson and og lemon haze styles.,3.7
Duet,Wonderful beer. Piney aroma along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose. Earthy pine dominates. Medium body and carbonation on the feel. This is an outstanding representation of what I would classify as a West Coast IPA. I use to be able to get this beer at Total Wine in Virginia in bottles. Then it disappeared. Now I can get it only in cans which is better than not at all. It has become my everyday go to session IPA although the cost continues to go up. Still well worth a try.,4.56
Duet,Very piney and floral hops with a moderate bitterness. Some tropical fruit and citrus too. Lots of hop character. Finishes clean and with a malty sweetness.,4.37
Duet,Looks beautiful. Golden orange with about one finger of head and solid lacing as it goes down. Smell is pine along with citrus. Also has an earthy vibe to it. Taste pretty much follows the nose.

Hey, there's some stuff on the label. Let's read it: ""A West Coast IPA that features Amarillo and Simcoe hops ""in harmony,"" giving a bright, floral aroma.

Undercover Investigation Shut-down Ale,"This is a real treat, bought as part of a mix-a-six at Bartonsville Giant. Poured out of 12 oz. bottle into pint glass.

L: Pours a rich cascading copper amber, with a big solid head that slowly recedes, leaving plenty of sticky lacing behind. Hazier than most beers I drink.

Smell: Sweet but rich. I detect rye bread, malt, toasted caramel, and honey. Notes of vanilla and tobacco emerge as it warms. Also a very mild, almost stale fruit note.

Taste: Luscious and luxurious. At first the hops tingle your tongue with bitterness, then you get the sweetness of the caramel and malts. There's something complex and smokey towards the back of the throat, like beef jerky. No burn whatsoever, and no tricks to hide the booze. For a beer of this alcohol content it is remarkably well balanced.

Feel: Very little carbonation. Still, the beer doesn't feel flat or sticky at all. Very smooth and clean, somewhat chewy and thick but not overly heavy.

Overall: Great beer. Most of the time I'm too broke to buy stuff like this but I decided to treat myself tonight. I'm glad I did. This isn't the most refreshing beer but it might just be the most palatable high-ABV offering you can buy.",4.07

Appearance: The tan, one and a half finger head stays around for a bit and leaves behind a lot of lacing that covers the entire glass. It's a deep, black color.

Smell: It's a strong, sweet aroma at first of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla and even raisins. There's also some coffee in there as well as honey roasted almonds.

Very complex & delicious flavor: chocolate, coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, rich & complex roaster malt flavors, mild earthyness & a fair amount of alcohol. Mild mouth & stomach heat with adequate carbonation. Medium viscosity. Evil Twin makes some outstanding beers & this is one of them.",4.32
Imperial Biscotti Break,"Canned 11/16/20

You know it's odd with this one. I was intrigued when I saw it on the shelf so I said fuck it and just picked it up without much thought. I figured it was a fun, but ultimately throwaway pastry stout. It is only now that I come to review it that I realize it's actually held in pretty high regard here. Hopefully then I'll be getting something that's less gimmicky than I expected

Pours completely pitch black with 2 fingers of dark khaki head that fades to a cap and leaves spotty lacing

This definitely has a defined sweetness in the nose, but it's hidden behind a pretty substantial roast. I'm picking up on aromas of chewy fudge, roasty espresso, creamy vanilla, earthy whiskey (weird bc it's not barrel aged), and some general nuttiness

There is also an incredible balance taste-wise between the dessert aspects and the straight up roasty stout notes. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting toasted almond, roasted malt, lightly acidic coffee, milk chocolate, and rich vanilla. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of fudge, soft oak, rich vanilla, dry roasted peanut, and roasted malt

A medium full body pairs with mild tingly carbonation, resulting in a super silky beer that never feels bogged down by the abv or the sweetness. Finishes mostly dry with a sweetness that slowly fades

For a non-BA imperial stout, this had a ton of complexity. Even with what some might consider ""unnecessary adjuncts"", this beer impressed me quite a bit",4.34

Saison Dupont,"11.2oz - found overpriced singles at Total Wine after the nice gal at the local death merchant ordered me some 4-packs

Looks amazing, chunky and looking like DUFF otherwise. Smells like funk and sweet barley. Taste has subtle banana sweetness, grassy hops that are medicinally bitter, hints of pepper and clove. Complex. Dry and well carbonated, the 6.5% is just perfect, and this drinks way too easy sitting there

The perfect summer beer: good for pool time, grilling, brown bagging it in the park, whatever",4.77
Saison Dupont,"This beer is exactly what I thought, years and years and years ago when I first heard of real craft beer, that it would look and taste like.

Pours a beautiful light orangey straw like colour, moderately cloudy in the glass. Four inches of rocky creamy head, like a little mountain, abide in the glass for a long time, even when it collapses 15 minutes later there is a layer of 1 inch thick head remaining. Simply put, it’s absolutely gorgeous.

This has a genuine barnyard smell on the nose. This is a generic phrase you hear a lot for saison and some other Belgian ales, but it is absolutely true here. Maybe because this is brewed at an actual farmhouse (they also produce bread locally and cheese you can buy) Leather and straw smells are strong, with some mild yeasty notes. Earthy, dirt like mist hits with the yeasty smells, like opening a wooden door on a dew-y, mildly humid summer morning. I’m not kidding, that’s not just flavour description, it really smells like that.

Taste is wonderfully complex. You might get hit with lemon upfront on some sips, or grassy hop bitterness on others, I think it depends how much you sip with how much air. Evolves to a mouthful of sourdough bread and yeast after a few seconds. Barnyard funkiness is all over, waning in and out of the other tastes. Yeast, citrus, fresh straw can also be noted throughout the tasting.

Medium body that ends with a sharp crispiness and dryly. Goes down smooth and easy, with the absolute perfect amount of carbonation. With my reviews I’ve always tried to do short, 3 paragraphs with straightforward descriptions, and I tried to keep it here too. Everything I wrote you absolutely will smell and taste, it sounds like a flowery review but that’s just because this beer is just that good. I’m looking forward to getting a bunch more as soon as possible and cellaring a couple bottles for the future. An absolute benchmark of the saison style and a recommendation to absolutely anyone who loves beer. Saison Dupont is remarkably complex and maybe most importantly, unbelievably delicious.",4.33

L - Light gold color with very slight haze and constant, mesmerizing streams of tiny bubbles that constantly rise through the beer. Huge, pillowy, frothy, off-white head that lasts and lasts.

S - Big hops aromas of grapefruit and mandarin orange, but with another earthy note, similar to pineapple. There is a bit of bready malt in the finish, very restrained, like a saltine cracker.

T - Strong, citrusy hops hit the mouth immediately, with navel orange, grapefruit and pine. The hop flavors are aggressive as hell and leave no room for malt to shine through. Exceptionally clean fermentation, with no yeast fruitiness noted.

F - Medium body with a bit of mouth-coating effect, yet somehow the finish feels dry. Moderate to high carbonation gives a fizzy impression on the tongue. Hops bitterness strong enough to peel paint. Alcohol presence fairly high, which matches the listed ABV, but the strength seems appropriate with all the other heightened sensory inputs.

S: Absolutely delicious aroma of pineapple, guava, passion fruit, pine, and grapefruit with a hint of medium caramel

T: The dank, piney, resinous aspects of the flavor are much more prominent but blend well with the fruitier qualities of grapefruit, pineapple, and guava. The caramel character is a bit stronger than I like but it works fine with the resinous character. Bitterness is strong. Clean, minimal ester profile. Alcohol is evident on the aftertaste.

Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"From a can into a pint glass. Pour has a vibrant, slowly receding head of light biege foam that tops a fantastic amber brown body that is generally clear but with uniform particulate throughout. Scent has the pretty typical nuttiness of a brown ale with sweeter notes of toffee and hazelnut rounding it out (and almost wholly avoiding the sometimes bitter scents of a brown ale). Taste is an incredibly well balanced blend of subtle nuttiness and hazelnut with a just a smidge of bitterness peeking out. Feel is very smooth with a pleasant aftertaste that follows the taste well. An all around excellent fall beer that is very, very drinkable.",4.07
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"This one I really like.

Poured a deep reddish auburn with a tan head that didn't last that long, but overall it still looked good in the glass.

Aroma and taste lived up to the hazelnut hype, and even the nectar part, as the feel was a bit thick and went down with a great deal of satisfaction.

This one had a nice complexity between hops, malt and hazelnut. I will absolutely buy it again. It was also nice to have an English brown ale, as this style is not very common in South tx",4.26
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"First, this is a well carbonated beverage. But it doesn't produce a ridiculous amount of beer head. In fact, the lightly biege head is very modest, although somewhat enduring. The brew itself is a solid brown color that's opaque, but far from murky. The aroma is malty and the described hazelnut addition is definitely subdued. That aspect isn't even in the initial taste. But then, as the brew lingers toward its finish, the hazelnut explodes. This is a truly unique drinking experience and a good one, should you like hazelnuts. As a brown ale there's no expectation of hoppiness and this is true to that style. That this can convert a mild malt character into one with such a hazelnut infusion is admirable. This may be another limited audience brew, but it's a great choice for anyone that likes their brown ales with a hazelnut flavoring. This best part, it adds a nutty aspect without any additional sweetness.",4.4
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"Pours a deep amber hue with a robust tan head.
Some mild hop scents. Not much aroma.

Not bad overall, an easy drinking hazelnut porter.",3.8
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"Very slightly hazy mahogany brown color with a nice moderate tan head that retrains well but produces very little lacing.
The aroma is warm fresh bread, slightly sweet malt and just a hint of nuttiness.
The taste is light sweet malt, biscuits, a touch of brown sugar and nicely light hazelnut with just enough floral hops for a nicely balanced overall flavor, nothing overpowering or too understated
The body is light/medium and very smooth with mild carbonation.
Overall, just a really pleasant brown ale, very nice.",4.19
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"Nutty: my favorite.

L- On the pour I got a 1finger head, as I drink there is light lacing. It is a deep reddish brown and the beer is almost hazy which is interesting, hopefully normal, but kinda cool.

S- the hazelnut flavor definitely comes through and it compliments the yeast they used nicely. Not a lot of hops on the nose, but that's kinda the point.

T- A warm (feeling/tasting) malty tidal wave of flavor dissipates into a pretty subtle hazelnut flavor with very light bitterness that also reminds me of a nut, not a lot of hops again.

F- the feel is mostly consistent and overall enjoyable but if you think about it there is a slick lens that comes right before a dryness but that's quite easy to move past

O- the flavor profile carrys this beer into nut brown ale stardom, as the hops from american craft brewing remove some of the nutty qualities from this english style. Sam smith still beats them out, but this is much more accessible and attractive to modern audiences.",4.26
Hazelnut Brown Nectar,"Appearance - Pours an opaque saddle brown with a slight tint of dark amber and burnt orange when held to a light. Little head that disappeared immediately. No lacing left on glass.

Smell - First aromas are chocolate-caramel candy. Noticeable maple syrup sweet smell. Slight nutty and toasted grain scent. No detectable hops.

Taste - Molasses, deeply roasted grain, chocolate cookies are the prominent flavors. Faint nuttiness and herbal or grassy notes were detected. It wasn't nearly as sweet as the aromas led me to believe. While there is a mild sweetness, there is enough bitterness to perfectly balance things. The aftertaste is both sweet and bitter and thankfully it lingers for a while. While the hazelnut flavors are barely there, this brew is still delicious.

Mouthfeel - Body is full and it hangs on the tongue for a while. Visually, the carbonation level looked low but in the mouth its actually moderate. This brew finishes dry and clean.

Overall - Disclaimer: Like an old man, brown ales are one of my favorite styles. I like malty, slightly sweet, full, dark toasty beer. This one hits the spot. The sweet/bitter ratio is right, it has some complexity (which many brown ales don't), and the after taste is terrific. This review is based off of my first sample of Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar. This won't be the last, though. Very highly recommended.",4.35
Dark Lord,"Pours a deep dark brown with moderate cappuccino head that dissipates fairly quickly leaving a thin ring around the edge of the glass.

Big aromas that burst from the bottle upon opening. Sweet milky coffee, dates, stewed fruits. A little charred food sits in behind.

Sweet vanilla hits the tongue first. It’s followed by coffee, much milder dates/figs/raisins. The sweetness stays for the duration, but isn’t over the top or unwanted. Again, in the background there is a charred food/ashy quality that I like. Not boozy in the least.

This is a big bodied beer. Thick without verging too far into syrupy territory. Long finish.

Dark Lord,"2019 vintage.

An aggressive pour resulted in a small amount of short-lived head that once gone left behind a cool looking swirl. Nice legs. Color is dark brown with a hint of light showing through around the very edges.

Aroma is fantastic and bursts from the glass. It's sweet with plenty of vanilla. There are some underlying notes that I'm having trouble distinctly naming, but they add a nice depth to the aroma.

Taste is really nice, and quite complex. There's a roastiness that wasn't apparent on the nose, with the vanilla & sugar present but well balanced. Hints of fig lurk in the background. Overall, it's plenty sweet but hovers just under the threshold where it would be too much. Feel is medium full. Very smooth, and low carb. An easy sipper.

Overall, this is excellent.",4.38
Dark Lord,"2020 Vintage

Pours pitch black, oily and viscous. A thin, weak mocha colored head forms on the beer momentarily before dissipating leaving no residual head behind. The head retention is not great, but otherwise its a nice looking beer. The aroma on this is interesting. Initially I got dark fruits when I poured it - lots of prune, raisin and even some port, along with a lovely vanilla note. As Im sitting here sipping it, I am getting much more of this umami, almost soy sauce aroma on this one. Now that I have got that on the brain I cannot shake it. That being said, there are some notes of roasted malts, barley, coffee, and vanilla. There is a certain sweetness to the beer that is clearly present on the nose.

The taste is very complex with a lot going on with this beer. So there are the notes of roasted malts, with notes of dark fruits - prunes, raisin, port wine - all coming in. There is a surprising level of sweetness to this beer that accentuates those fruity notes. As those move across the palate there are notes of fruity coffee, and some piney hops. The finish is where that umami/soy character on the nose comes in on the flavor. The finish then has that umami soy with a slight salty note - although that may just be my mind playing tricks on me from that soy flavor. There is a moderate bitterness on the finish as well with some light piney notes. Feel is medium bodied but rather viscous. Moderate carbonation.

Overall a complex and delicious Russian imperial stout from Three Floyds. I can certainly see why this beer earned the reputation it enjoys in the craft beer community. That being said, I can also see why it does not have the same cache it once had. Its an old school beer that just does not seem to fit in the current stout trends.

Poured pitch black with a burnt coffee color head and lacing. The aroma was milder than expected but still very good; malts and coffee and dark cocoa, no hops found.
The taste was able to meet my elevated expectations. Of stouts I have had, I don’t think that I have had one better and I’m not sure I’ve had it’s equal. All the malts and coffee and cocoa (flavors from the malts and hops as no additives were used to my understanding) merge into a flavor that fills your mouth and makes you want more.

Dark Lord,"2020 bottle purchased from a private collection for $25. Super excited i found it. I like the mystique surrounding this beer. Only available once a year. Only available at the brewery in Indiana. Rated super highly. Many derivative versions that are also rated highly, if not higher and single bottles that trade for hundreds of dollars in private circles on the internet. The multicolored waxes that adorn each year's vintage. The black wax that adorns mine. It's my son's birthday, so that seems like a good occasion to drink it.

Poured out a heavy dark brown, nearly black, with a creamy one inch head that dissipates into a ring around the glass. Scents of dark raisins and other fruits, a bit of vanilla. The smell isn't very strong, rather on the weak side so i had to swirl my glass several times to release the aromas. Upon sipping, I'm greeted by raisin and rich sweet chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Perhaps a chocolate covered cherry. Notes of char and leather are present. Coffee is used in this brew but it's not too strong. The brew is mostly a sweet wash, with just a little bit of bitterness to balance it, hovering on the back end as it washes down my throat. Dark Lord is thick and syrupy, just the way I love my stouts, and sticks to my lips, sweetening them long after the swallow. Overall this is a beer to enjoy as a meal in and of itself, as it is hearty and rich, bold and strong at 15%ABV.

I've read that this stout was there before stouts really came into their own, and that the overall field has risen to meet the standards this beer once set. It's better than some stouts, like i like it better than Old Rasputin, but in fact it is comparable in overall savory flavor to some Hoppin Frog stouts like TORIS. So while once upon a time some may have journeyed far and wide to experience this flavor, i think one can obtain beer just as good as this without searching too far from home. However, what an experience! And I feel like I've now joined a secret club. The Dark Lord club.",4.76
Dark Lord,"Bottle, 2009 vintage, kindly shared by gunnar. Black colour, hardly any head. Aroma of heavily roasted malts, dark chocolate, coffee and liquorice. Intense flavour of roasted malts, coffee and liquorice.",4.22
Dark Lord,"Thank you eppie82 for this one!

2019 Vintage (purple/glitter wax) poured into a balloon stem at 50°F.

Pours a deep cola brown - fairly fluid, abd sitting coal black in the glass, with no real head. A swirl forms a dark brown collar and some cling along the glass.

Nose: Big, bold roast lends some baker's chocolate, cacao, burned toffee, brown sugar, and a deep, almost savoury character. Yes, I understand where the ""soy sauce"" descriptor comes from. A bit of a meaty character, with some char and marmite, but this seems to be a product of the heavy roast. Some underlying dried cherry dark fruit. Definitely unique.

Palate: Before I start, I will say that the savoury soy sauce note is strictly limited to the aroma. It doesn't show up here. Moving on. A few things stand out first. One, this stout is sweet. Very sweet. That unique concentrated cane flavour of the Indian sugar is present, along with the sweetness. Lots of sweet, tarry molasses, brown sugar, and even a blackstrap rum thing going on. The vanilla is definitely lending character, but not like a ""vanilla stout"" - it's tame, identifiable, and well-balanced. I'm not getting any coffee. The malt itself is so classically Russian, with big, super dark roast, earthy char, and all those bold roasty notes. The hops are also very old school, with earthy, leafy bittering hop character meshing with the roast. Approaching the finish, vanilla fades, and the blackened roast and earthy hops take over, pushing some sweetness out, lending some earthiness and char, but very little bitterness. The finish highlights this, with a touch of molasses.

Mouthfeel/Body: While it didn't appear so on the pour, wow is this one fudgy. Full-bodied, heavy, thick, and chewy, while not crossing the line into syrup territory. It isn't close to BBT or Assassin thick, but it's certainly in that same vein of luscious and fudgy. There's actually some nice, fizzy, albeit fine effervescence that pokes through a bit. Definitely some residual stickiness.

Overall: This is an interesting stout. Today, we're inundated with all of these mega pastry stouts brewed with half a bakery. While there are ""adjuncts"" in here - vanilla, coffee, and Indian sugar, those flavours are dialed way back, to the point of almost feeling like a plain stout. It's the sweetness that really stands out. On top of that, it's the only dessert stout I've had that retains that classic Russian Imperial flavour profile, and that's unique. Picture a dessert Russian Imperial Stout. If that sounds good, then this will likely deliver.",4.16

Dark Lord,"2020 vintage sampled day 2 of availability. Nose is prominent malty roast and dark chocolate, light coffee. No soy notes like some people mention in previous years.

Not a sugar bomb like it has come to be known for.",4.38
Shiner Bock,"Truth in advertising here, almost to a fault. Copperish color, a tad off whit foam head that disappeared within a minute or so. N lacing. Aroma was soapy (hence the clean, crisp taste?).

Shiner Bock,"A great Texas-take on a German-style beer, which is more lager, than a traditional German Bock beer. Lacing was decent. Smell was very much bread-like and malty and not at all hoppy. Goes down smooth and easy. If you're looking for a more medium body beer that is great to enjoy on a hot day.... this is your beer. And yes.... every drop is still very much brewed in Shiner, Texas. Their brewery tour in Shiner is pretty cool.",4.98
Shiner Bock,"Undated bottle. Nice clear dark ruby with a brief off-white head. Tastes a lot like a lager, but with roasted malts and a bit of caramel. Mouthfeel is light and fizzy. No bitterness in the taste or in the finish. Overall, an easy-drinking ""lite"" American take on the style.",3.79
Shiner Bock,"Poured from an undated 12 oz. bottle: beautiful, clear garnet red with a quickly receding, foamy white head.

The aroma is somewhat subdued with ""lager-like"" aromas of spicy malts and faint hops.

Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is that this is quite light and subtle to be an authentic ""bock"" beer that tends to be full-bodied and somewhat thick; however, this is a good ole American style version that is a thirst-quencher for hot summer days in Texas as well as the rest of the USA. The initial flavor is slightly tangy with malts and hints of molasses. The hop complement and zesty carbonation keep this one refreshing and quaffable. I almost detect a little rye in the aftertaste. At 4.5 % ABV, this one has a lot of flavor. The body is thin and the carbonation is quite high with a slick mouthfeel. I should drink this more often. Good buy from Wal-Mart.",3.68
Shiner Bock,"Better than most of the macro brews, but firmly in the macro brew camp. Definitely hits the spot after a day fishing (one of my go to beers for that).",3.94
Shiner Bock,"Poured from a 12oz bottle, undated

On the pour a relatively weak 1 finger head forms then dissipates to a ring around the glass. Despite that lively carbonation ensues. The color is darker than amber, solidly brown and crystal clear. Some lacing tries to form a few sips in, but fails.

Aroma is quite light with a decent amount of generic, yet clean lager smell. No hops are really present, which is expected, and some sweet dark malts hide in the back with a vague caramel vanilla note and offset the relatively bright and almost tart lager note. However the aroma is very mild almost bland. Nothing off though.

Flavor follows the smell, but brings more malts with less sweetness. Lager character dominates this beer with malt being more of a background experience, however it is present. Relatively light, and the flavor isn't all that dark or complex.

Feel is easy to put down, but not really a bock. Very light and more like an American lager. In that category however this would do very well. It's light but still maintains body and doesn't just disappear. Nice and bubbly with a decent bite. Still bigger than coors or bud, but nowhere near a real bock.

Overall this is a good beginner beer, to bring someone over from only drinking light colored non hoppy lagers to the darker side of things. Also good for someone who likes lagers and dark beers (mostly lagers) and just doesn't want to think too much. Not complex and closer to an American lager than a bock despite the color. More yeast driven than malt driven, but clean and nothing bad about it other than lack of complexity and inspiration.",3.2
Shiner Bock,"Keeping in mind that this is an American Bock, and not a European style, expect this beer to be less aggressive on all counts.
A medium brown color, light tan head that doesn't last very long. Bubbly, like a soda.
Nose is light malt, no hops at all, which is actually good for the style.
Taste is a light roasted malt flavor with some raisin-like aftertaste. Just the slightest hint of hop bitterness but no hop taste at all. Very, very light body. Too much carbonation for my liking.
Judging this for what it is, it's an okay American bock.",3.11
Shiner Bock,"L - Poured from a draft into pint glass. One finger light off white head. Deep amber color. Clear with no inclusions. Some lacing that fades quickly.

S - Sweet bready malt up front. Some caramel notes

T - Some bitterness up front, but the maltiness takes center stage. Fades quickly. The malt flavors seem like a little caramel and a faint scent of roastiness.

F - Medium to thin mouthfeel. Light carbonation from the draft pour

O - As a Texan, I’ve had this many times, but this is my first time since trying more beers for review. The taste is good, but being a bock, the expectation is for “more.” More flavor, stronger flavors, etc. It’s fairly mild overall, but that means it’s easy to drink. Like a lot of the regionally famous beers, it’s highly easy to drink a lot of them. It definitely in my regular rotation, and I’d recommend checking it out just to see what another regional standard tastes like.",3.58

Move on and buy something else. Idiots on here. I'm tired of them.",4.46
Shiner Bock,"Pours a crystal clear mahogany, half-inch off-white head that quickly fades, minimal lacing. Nose is light straw, lemon cleaner, and light roast as it warms - nothing objectionable, but nothing too prominent, either. Taste is a bit more expressive with light toffee sweetness, bread crust, and dark fruit. Mouthfeel has some chew but still drinks on the lighter side. Nothing off or offensive - just solid and sessionable.",3.13
Shiner Bock,"Feel is the main drawback here. Poured from the can into a Tulip, I got a slight metal taste like once so I don't think thats really a thing. Malty ish but not much doing. I got the sixer for less than $7.50 so that's sick but yeah.....some how also seems to get more light in feel as I get through it. This tastes like ""beer"" more than a bock if that makes any sense.


The feel seems to be better hella cold right out the can to me now lol idk dude",3.34
Shiner Bock,If you like tangerines this is for you. It’s basically flavored vodka in beer form so if that suites you go for it no shame in that I just like spiced Christmas beer.

Tripel Karmeliet,"Poured from just under fridge temp from a 750ml bottle. Pours a semi-opaque yellow/orange with a LOT of gorgeous head. It takes several minutes for the voluptuous head to recede. The nose is spectacular. An earthy orange, wheat, yeast, marmalade, honey, apricot, and banana. How - very exciting!

The taste is incredible. Sweet toffee, marmalade, apricots, peaches, pineapple, Belgian yeast, orange, candy malts, and banana. This is quite different from many other tripels that I have tasted. Almost entirely sweet without any bitterness. Not too sweet though.

The mouthfeel is fairly light and somewhat dry. Overall, this is probably my favorite tripel to date. Can't wait to have another!",4.45
Tripel Karmeliet,This triple is probably one of the most Unique because it’s made from grain three types of wheat grain gives it a flavor of sweet wheat beer with a kick! Love it!!,5.0
Tripel Karmeliet,"Tall, white head from a VERY gentle, drizzle down the side pour. Audible fizziness as I pour, almost like a soft drink. Very good retention leaving sticky lacing (and a nicely laced empty chalice). Slightly hazy golden body, heavily carbonated.

The aroma is not too strong, but sweet. Bubblegum, and a bit of banana.

The flavor brings the tastes promised by the aroma, sweet bubblegum and banana. The middle has very slight bittering, which does not last into the finish. Behind the already mentioned flavors is a lightly tart fruitiness, perhaps pear (hard to tell) along with a semi-sweet component - perhaps even vanilla - and floral. The finish is creamy and smooth, with an aftertaste of smoothness, maybe from the soft carbonation that is hard for me to describe, spreading out on the tongue. This aftertaste is exquisite!

The mouth feel is quite smooth (yeah, I keep using that word), with a gentle carbonation on my tongue. Moderate body.

Karmeliet is malty, smooth, and yet heavily carbonated with a huge creamy head, not very (if at all) spicy, several sweet components to the flavor without ever entering cloying territory and finishing only semi-sweet. The feel of the aftertaste is, as I stated above, exquisite. Wow!

An excellent tripel!",4.41
Tripel Karmeliet,"A cloudy orange hued straw color, super bubbly big soapy bubble head. Dissipated relatively fast to a thin layer of opaque white.

Taste is similar to the nose with all the same parts except the refreshing appleness is more noticeable and on the finish.

Medium body but it drinks very light, the carbonation is big when it hits the tongue, almost bubbles up the whole mouth. A really nice minor acidity on the finish.",4.02

Medium body; light velvet feel; dry mouthfeel overall.

What a fine tripel! Gorgeous appearance and aroma with a fantastically complex and balanced flavor profile.

Pouring temperature: 54 °F; bottling data: 06/04/23E (neck label)",4.52
Tripel Karmeliet,"Wonderful triple. Pretty much the industry standard for the style. Only the monks can do it better.

Taste: Malt: White bread, oats/wheat, nutty, very light caramel. Hops: Floral/lemony.
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied, slick-ish feel.
Overall: Light, sessionable summer lager. Poolside beer. A little extra hop bitterness/bite than your typical. Lemony, goes well with pasta. Good by itself, inoffensive.",3.34
Summerfest,"As I sit on a rock in the shallow waters of the Pemigewasset River, I can't help but to sit an enjoy my fleeting moments of Summer with this years Summer Fest Lager. It has a pleasant golden glow that glistens like the water that runs over the white rocks. It is crisp like the brisk water that cool you off from the sun's August rays. Some earthy notes tickle your nose and you then taste this beer's lemony, malty goodness that ends with a slight bitter after taste. All in all a solid summertime lager, but nothing too fancy.",3.24
Summerfest,"Look: Lovely clear gold just what a pilsner should look like. One finger head that dissipated quickly. Slow rising bubbles but not a lot.
Smell: Earthy spicy noble hops over a nice bready malt
Taste: Surprisingly sweet at first. Bold and hoppy (like a pilsner of course, not hoppy like an IPA). Great balance between hoppiness and maltiness. And between sweet and bitter, obviously leaning more toward bitter.
Flavor: Tastes like a sunny afternoon in a Prague café. Herbal with lemon zest. Bready malt with a softer peppery bitterness.
Feel: Medium mouthfeel, clean crisp with just the right amount of carbonation. Dry bitter finish.
Overall: I have tried to steer myself away from drink all IPA’s all the time, so this is another in a stream of pilsners that I have tried. American Brewers are nailing pilsners, Everyone I taste is as good or better than the last. Looks great in the glass smells like what I used to think was a pilsner that was of European origin. When I was in Europe in 1980, I was embarrassed of behalf of American beer. The beers I drank in Europe inspired me to drink European beers for all of the 80’s and well into the 90’s. We obviously gained a lot of ground when IPA’s swept the beer landscape. I don’t know when American brewers began to equal the great pilsners of Europe, but they have.",3.96
Summerfest,"Light gold, pretty clear and a slight amount of head with some lacing. On first whiff you notice bready malts with that ubiquitous Sierra Nevada aroma that runs like a thread through most of their lighter ales and lagers. The taste is a nice peppery hop snap with a smooth malt backbone, biscuity, and a little herbal. It’s also well carbonated and super easy to drink on a warm day. This was from the second batch in June so there is no “fade” in this bottle.
In closing, what can I say that hasn’t been said before; it’s old reliable, SN, easy to find, the price is always right and they always do a nice job of coming close to the style they’re brewing with their own stamp on it. One bottle left in the second sixer and I do believe I’ll spring for a third with a heatwave coming this week, cheers!",4.0
Summerfest,"I've only had this a few times, since I'm usually not drawn to lagers (except pilsners). But it really is a nice go-to beer when you want something simple and don't have much selection to choose from.

Pours with a transparent golden body and white head. Specks of lacing decorate the glass, but it's nothing to write home about. Great can art.

Biscuit, lemon, lime and white pepper notes grace the nose, bringing a slightly funky malt base reminiscent of the kolsch style. Hints of basil and yeasty pizza dough on the finish. Simple, but nice.

Taste is exactly as expected from the aroma. Just enough bitterness to call itself a beer. The hops are quite restrained and the lager yeast and malt shine. Farmy hay notes on the finish.

Smooth and light texture. It could stand to be lighter, but not by much. It still tastes like food to me, which I consider essential.

Really good for the style, appropriate for the weather and widely available. SN always delivers. Cheers!",3.95

S - Grassy spice hop, with just a touch of honey on the nose.

O - I pleasant summer drinker, as advertised.",3.78

Barleycorn and wheats, lil hoppy, faint feet.

Feels pretty good, semi dry/semi sweet. Balanced bitterness and malt fullness.

Summerfest,"Appearance: Pours a completely clear, medium-golden color with a strong white head that sits quietly for a while. SRM of 6. (4.25)

Aroma: Light aromas of orange citrus, apple, grape. Some bread dough sweetness. The aroma is subdued and subtle, but it has that classic SN orange citrus/nectar aroma. (3.75)

Flavor: Initial flavors of yeast and grainy upfront. Followed by an orchard fruit quality. There's sweet orange & apple juice. A slight bitterness comes through on the end, but the yeast finishes it dry. Again, the classic SN orange citrus/nectar flavor. Even a little bit of pine. (3.75)

Feel: Light, crispy, well-carbonated. Good carbonation and yeast finish it dry with nothing left on the palate. Goes down extremely light. (3.75)

Compared to Alaskan Kolsch 6/14/20: Pours a lighter color. More orange/nectar and apple juice flavors. Less malty sweetness and cherry. Overall, lighter and cleaner.

Compared to Zipline Brewing's Kolsch 7/5/20: Pours a darker color. Stronger fruit and hoppy aromas. Less malty bread. A bit more of a citrus and crispy bite.

Compared to Trader Joe's Josephbra Czech Pilsner 8/14/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More orange dish soap on the aroma. Less bread. Dryer, crisper.

Compared to Oberon 8/23/20: Pours a similar color. More nectarine/apple/bread on the aroma. Less dry orange. Overall, sweeter.

Compared to SN Oktoberfest 2020, 8/23/20: Pours a lighter color. More pale malts and orcharfruit aromas. Less resinous orange/nectar. Slightly more tart and less bready. Overall, these are quite similar. I think we all know who copied whose homework.

Overall: A pretty good summer drink. Not exactly a Czech-style pilsner. Not really in hardly any aspect except slightly bready. It's got more fruit and yeast, with little signs of any noble hops. I actually mislabeled this as a Kolsch. It has more Kolsch orchard fruit flavors. Lots of nectarine/peach/apple. It actually has classic Sierra Nevada orange soap flavors too. Finishes on the dry side, with less malts for a Czech pils and more classic and resinous Sierra Nevada orange pine. (Final Rating: 3.83)

*Compare to a dense Kolsch*",3.83
Summerfest,"Look: Light golden in color, clear and a vigorous pour brings on a good head that recedes leaving good lacing

Mouthfeel: Clean, balanced, and light but not watery. Medium carbonation and a huge depth of flavor but not at all so that it leads to a heavy feel
Overall: Awesome stuff. Crisp, balanced, and full of flavor.

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"This beer is way more balanced than your typical IPA. The first note was more malt than hops, which was interesting. Bread and toasted malt. Then the hops. Floral, slightly earthy, a bitnof pine. Balance is the big word here. Super drinkable. A go-to beer for sure.",3.82
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"Poured a couple of brown 12 oz. bottles into a singular clear glass liter mug for observation. It's a light bright copper color, with emphasis on light. Rather translucent more than colorful, maybe the head and lacing will compensate. No, there's little of either there. The lacing outperforms, but not by much. It's not aromatic, neither. OK, now for the taste, the big category. Unfortunately, nothing to rave about here. It's pretty good; well balanced between a noticeable malt backbone, which is more earthy than sweet (good) and a hoppy finish. The body is a little thin and the hops aren't bitter enough, but they're there. If ever there was an IPA intended to be mass produced to offend the least number of drinkers, this is it. Not at all rebellious, it conforms to the basic norms of a mainstream beer with a hint of a style above the standard American lager. Likely the best choice at national chain restaurants.",3.63
Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"12/11/14:
Appearance: clear, bright golden hue, long-lasting, bone white head, looking good.

Aroma: Fresh and lively hop aromatics, screaming with citrus and tropical fruits, bristling with pine and grass. Green as it gets.

Taste: Brisk hop bite at the front, soft and mellow from there on out. Light bodied, but with a long, bitter hop finish. Exquisite drinkability, but for hop-heads only. Bitter hop resins lay long on the palate, providing more than sufficient refreshment for those of us who crave the alpha acids.

A very nice rendition of this popular style, but it's not just not landing on the top tier, I'm afraid. A few steps short.

Wait. I just noticed something. The box reads: ""Enjoy before Dec. 2014."" No specific date given. This was purchased in early December 2014. I always see a lot of these cases at the store I bought it at, I'm guessing it's not that popular, for whatever reason. Maybe if I'd bought it earlier, it would taste fresher, and I'd see higher up on that tier…maybe...

What's the paper on the bottle say? ""Rebel IPA is brewed with 5 varieties of West Coast hops: Cascade, Simcoe, Centennial, Chinook & Amarillo, It's everything we love about West Coast-style IPAs, Big citrus & grapefruit flavors with subtle pine notes for a flavorful, refreshing brew.""",3.87

Samuel Adams Rebel IPA,"16oz can, pint glass, best by June 2020.

Crystal clear goldenrod with a whopper of a head! Two plus fingers of cratering new parchment foam rise and linger, dissipating slowly, becoming more craggy as time advances.

Clean, biting grapefruit rind, a trace of pineapple, some caramel peeking through as this nears it's drink by date, and Cascade floral-ness.

I get a dose of biscuity caramel that's quickly doused by a hit of grapefruit and bitterness. Pine and mango develop and pass into a medium bitter finish that's mostly clean, but sports a little soapy pith. It's really quite a hoppy one.

Medium bodied, though with more viscosity than normal for the style. The carbonation is medium-high and stands up to it.

I come away almost embarrassed that I've always discounted this beer, so much so that I hadn't tried it until this monstrous deal of a case of 16oz cans for $12 landed in my lap. I have my vacation pool beer now. I appreciate Sam's homage to the classic American, almost West Coast, IPA. Even when almost six months old the hops are very present.",3.83

Unfiltered, no foam at first, but a big head that sticks around after an aggressive pour; looks like apple cider otherwise. Not too sweet, not too sour... tart. Light. Not much to speak of, grain and sour peaches. Smells like a corona with too much lime.

The ""Neo-Berliner Weiss"" tag is bizarre - I'll call it ""Sour Light""",3.66
Festina Pêche,"Bottled 5/19/18

Pours a pale golden straw with a finger of quickly fading white head

The aroma has a strong note of lemon sourness with light malts to back it up, not much peach at all

The front of the sip is tart and a little malty, and it turns into a more subtle, dry peach with a doughy aftertaste. A great balance here, though I was expecting a bit more on the peach front

Highly carbonated and easy drinking, a very light refreshing finish

This is an all around great beer, despite the only slight hint of peach flavor, which could be chalked up to freshness, it's just over 17 months old so it may have lost a bit of flavor, and I'd love to try it fresh",3.93
Festina Pêche,"I had a full draft pint at the brewpub in Rehobeth on my birthday in 2017. It was sour, which I usually don't like, but it was tasty nonetheless on a warm day. I have liked other peach beers in the past. Enjoyed the brewpub, but it was very crowded in early August and we had to wait for a table.",3.85

Festina Pêche,"Poured aggresively into a Mason Jar :D Beautiful thick white head dissapates resonably quick to reveal a thin lacing of white atop a pale straw ambrosia :) now the fun begins.... Aromas of sour dough, ripe peaches and Musk give way to a paletable sour! This is one of the easier drinking sours ( i would reconmend it to anyone unsure about the style). Very refreshing sour and a light finish that leaves you wanting more :) A darn fine brew indeed!",4.28
Festina Pêche,This Neo-Berliner Weisse that is fermented with peaches is by far one of my all time favorites. A pale gold appearance with a nice white head. The Aroma makes me think of a peach orchid with a hint of lemon. The balance between fruit and crisp style with a bit of a sourness is refreshing . The mouthfeel is clean with a great finish. Summertime however can see this beer go down faster than normal.,4.87
Festina Pêche,"This is the rare beer that I actually prefer to drink directly from the bottle. For whatever reason, the peche / peach pops more that way. Drank it that way at a tailgate that was lacking glassware once, and now it 's my preferred modus drinkerus for this beer.",4.06

Hop Nosh IPA,"Based on my fairly unkind perception of Hop Nosh's expression back in 2015, I find it absolutely necessary to delete my old review and reevaluate now, as that opinion just does not apply anymore, largely in terms of my own palate, preferences and overall experiential evolution.

Lightly foggy orange-amber--just about as hazy as Hazy Nosh, ironically enough--with a moderately short off-white head leaving substantial but fluid lacing that falls back down to the surface in slo-mo.

A solid West Coast IPA with plenty of citrus and pine working in concert, it's quite a bit more bitter and dank than their hazy, obviously, but without all that limey juiciness, instead exhibiting some catty hints in the exhale. However, it's quite clean up front, and stunningly reminds me of the sort of prickly resins often found in Fat Head's stellar IPA program, although paired with a lesser hint of dampening graham.

The moderate body has a gently expanding carbonation and finishes just dry.",4.03
Hop Nosh IPA,"Poured from a 12 oz can into a Sixpoint can glass

the beer pours a murky light copper color with a ton of floaties. Kind of surprised after reading so many reviews describing the color as a clear copper color... about three fingers worth of rocky white head with substantial lacing.

Lots of citrus fruits in the aroma, as well as some pineapple, mango, and papaya. Mildly bready and earthy malts balance out the hopiness.

Like the aroma the flavor is orange, papaya, mango, with a nice bready, toasty malt character. Great balance. Medium bodied and slick on the tounge. A bit heavier than most IPA's, definitely a well balanced beer more in line with the east coast IPA style, but with the big citrusy hop punch of a west coast IPA

Overall, a very good beer that I would would be happy to see on tap or on the shelf.",4.15

Hop Nosh IPA,"Ok folk's !!! I do not do alot of reviews on this site any more due to my general lack of enthusiasm with the hype of the Hazy IPA craze !!! Tropical this, melon that, no malt just hops and yeast and quite frankly it is extremely boring too say the least. There is no such thing as balance anymore. BORING !!!!

This is an old school IPA that is not geared for the hipster IPA scene. It has plenty of hop aroma and flavor that when paired with the selection of rich malts creates an exceptionally balanced brew. Yes I get it !!! Most younger folks will not appreciate this balance but I actually miss this style of an IPA !!! An IPA is supposed to be balanced !!!! Nowday's brewery's can just throw hops in a hop back with a tinge of pale malts and become an overnight success. Zero balance and flavor nuances.

I give this brew two thumb's up because of the overall balance of malt and hops. This is what and IPA should taste like. I am bored to tears with the current IPA offerings from brewery's. No thought or balance just hops. I have zero respect for the brewmasters / breweries.",4.71
Hop Nosh IPA,"Pours a sunburst orange with a lighter orange/yellow at the top. Slightly murky tint to it. Head is a finger of snowy white foam with modestly good retention. Aroma is tangerine, papaya, orange, mango, resiny and dank hops. Light bready, earthy malts add a bit of balance and 'boniness' to the back-end of the aroma. It's a pleasant contrast to the initial hops. Flavor profile is orange, papaya, tangerine, mango, resiny, herbal and dank hops with bready, earthy, toasty malts. Balance is great, with the hops out front and sticking to the tongue long after the sip. Mouth feel is lightly sticky with a light graininess to it. It has a medium to medium-thick consistency offering up a 'heavier' presence. Overall, hops are great and are contrasted well by malts; however, the focus remains wholly on the hops.

Hop Nosh IPA,"Appearance: Pours a deep orange, dark peachy color. A white and lacy head. SRM of 13. (3.75)

Aroma: Dank resinous melon, lime, pineapple, and red grape. A touch of vanilla yogurt with berries. (3.75)

Flavor: Lots of lime, red grape and grapefruit. Maybe a touch of lychee and an almost plastic or medicinal quality. Finishes with rich caramel malts, yet a fairly strong bitter finish. A unique flavor, but also reminiscent of some of the first IPAs I've tried. (4.00)

Feel: Medium-bodied, Average carbonation. Lingering bitter pine and pith which is appropriate. Right in line with what an IPA should be. (4.00)

Overall: Definitely a good IPA. Takes the IPA back to it's origins in terms of a hop profile. Reminds me of some of the first IPAs I tried. On par with what a good IPA should be. Nothing extraordinary, but a good rating for being traditional and accurate to it's origins. (Final Rating: 3.98)",3.98
Hop Nosh IPA,"Can Date: 6/12/19
Palate Contaminants: none

Color is a medium orange. Slightly murky. Moderate amount of fine head that doesn't hang around so long.

Lots of malt on the nose, but the grain evokes a wheat brew. The sweetness also contributes to a marmalade scent. Light bits of vegetation, specifically cilantro and moss. Overall, it could use some more intensity, though.

Bitterness up front right away, and too much of it. The moss is still there, but the sweetness and anything connected to it is buried. The bitterness even disconnects the malt from any sweetness, which actually makes the whole thing not so cohesive. Not that it's not palatable, there are just so many other good IPAs out there.

Good medium weight, and the carbonation is pretty smooth. Alcohol about par for a sevener. Bitterness just continues in the aftertaste.",3.87

Mouthfeel: Full but light, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and clean and crisp on the finish

Fizzy, herbal, elegant bitterness, skunky from the Czech Republic’s native spicy Saaz hops, the soft water profile sets the standard for the style.
It’s an acquired taste for sure, and is a great accompaniment for sausages, sauerkraut, dumplings and goulash.

There's better Pilsners, but they're not necessarily available. Macro brew doesn't get better than this at least in the style",3.83
Pilsner Urquell,"The original Pilsner! It’s good to try these to have that good benchmark for future tasting.

Pours a crystal clear, light golden straw colour with a nice effervescent yet tightly packed, three finger head that slowly recedes over 5 minutes leaving a very circular, spotty cap.

Fairly savoury aroma, interestingly enough. A little bit funky and skunky, mild cheese in the savoury department but without being too musty. Clean aromas for the skunkiness. Gentle floral aromas and clean wheat and breads.

A pleasant bitterness punctuates throughout the flavour profile. Taste follows the nose but it’s a lot cleaner and less funky than the nose suggests. Bready, wheaty, clean floral and grassy on the palate. A little bit sweet with the crisp malt flavours balanced by the grassy, floral hop bitterness.

Crisp mouthfeel with medium carbonation, the large bubbles create a tickling, clean sip. Light bodied with a gentle, subtle but bittersweet finish. Dryish finish.

It’s an interesting beer for sure, better than any typical American lager macro. The skunkiness/savoury notes certainly add a unique aspect to this drink. At the price point it’s never a bad option and it’s great on tap. Glad I could revisit this as I begin to drink craft again, always good to go back to the basics/classics so you can remember the benchmarks for each style.",3.64

T - Wow! Starts off simple; floral and grassy. Evolves into a more chewy bread note, then into a bitter hop bite. Nice and bittersweet at first, and finishes bitter.
F - Crisp. Clean. Easy-to-drink. Not filling in the slightest.
O - The de-facto pilsner. Well-balanced, complex enough, and rounded. Though it's not the best, it sets the bar for what a pilsner should be! I definitely recommend it, but don't kill yourself looking for it.",4.42
Pilsner Urquell,"It's good! But a bit overrated. It's a nice pilsner which is easy to drink and fairly balanced, the little bit of sweetness weights up the bitterness from the hops in a good way without becoming too sweet. Has a nice carbonation, served here in a 50 cl can.

But it is something out of the ordinary? Nah, not really. It's good, but it's not something you go ""woooow"" over.
Perfect beer though if you want an easy-going ice cold beer to relax with in the summer or together with a bite to eat, imo.

I buy it from time to time, which means I like it enough to come back to it. So I say try it, especially if you like stanard lagers/pilsners. There are a lot of worse lagers out there for sure.",3.5

Look: It's kind of straw-like in appearance. Almost see-through. Reminds me of a sunny San Diego day without any marine layer.

Smell is a mix of citrus (grapefruit) and piney resins. A bit of malt, the tiniest bit, is also there.

Taste: Bitter hops and added citrus bitter/sweetness. Some piney notes as well. There is malt to fill out the flavor.

Feel: Comparatively thin in the mouth. Not bad, but the malt backbone that I really like in my substantial brews isn't terribly notable.

Overall: I'd drink this almost any time. There are definitely more developed IPAs and double IPAs out there these days, but this is a classic that's still eminently enjoyable.",3.98

Pours two massive fingers of tan head into my snifter. Retention is average, and the head fades within a few minutes. Lacing is pretty nice. Body is pitch black with some ruby hues when held to the light. Looks pretty good.

Nose is dry and roasty. Touch of spice to it / woody. Smells decent enough.

Flavor is just slightly roasty, but not much. Has some fruity esters in the finish. Some chocolate comes out as it warms. Tastes alright, somewhat underwhelming until it warms up though.

Carbonation is pretty high. Body is medium. Bitterness is medium-low. Has a touch of dryness, but pretty modest there, finishes with some sweetness - well balanced. A nice mouthfeel, the sweetness and carbonation help add some character where the flavor is lacking.

Drinkability is very good.

The intensity of taste is closer to medium than high. The flavor follows the aroma with the addition of a ashy and pipe tobaco flavor. The bitterness is low.
The feel is somewhat above medium in thickness. Carbonation is a little below medium which tamps down the ashy pipe tobaco flavor. The astringency is closer to high than medium making it a quite dry beer.

F - Medium-to-full mouthfeel with decent carbonation. Smooth drinking all the way through.

O - This was a very enjoyable beer. I drank in the hot summer in 99 degree weather, but this would be fantastic in the winter months. It might not beat my favored winter beers at higher ABV than this, but I have thoroughly enjoyed the handful of beers I’ve tried from New Belgium Brewing Co.

Moderate malts, a hint of chocolate again, also a hint of prunes and liquorice, very mild spices.",3.18
1554,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour it's dark but not black indoor lighting reveals a dark brown that let's a small amount of light through, held up to light it's a dark reddish brown with no haze. Less than one finger head that dissipates immediately to a ring around the glass.

Aroma is definitely influenced by licorice but very subtly and it blends into the dark malt sweetness quite well. The new Belgium website says there is in fact some nugget hops but they aren't very present in the aroma. Beyond the licorice it's similar to a belgian trippel/Dunkel in aroma if you were to combine the two traditional styles.

Taste is quite dry and yeasty but with some chocolate roasty malt notes. Some herbal bitterness but this beer is quite easy to drink and not the heaviest in flavor. I'd say this is pretty similar to the Baltic porter style. Lagery porter like beer but they don't call it either of those things. Some bitterness does creep up as you drink, dissimilar to hops, that seem to get less bitter as you drink. Definitely a dark malty beer

Feel is creamy but drinkable. Similar to a Baltic porter once again. Not light but not too heavy either. Big beer relative to a lot of what's out there but smaller than the trippel by these guys.

I love the 'Euro dark lager' label for this, because it's sort of appropriate, despite this being an undeniably familiar relic of early craft beer Dubbel knock-offs... as a 'lager', it's great, but c'mon, don't corrupt my to-style ratings bro; their zwert story is romantically compelling but bs - doesn't result in a distinctive brew... arguably slightly higher marks than it deserves (bland, rough edges), but I'd have this again (1849)",4.09
1554,"Look: Dark brown to black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light with a short-lasting head that settles to a film and leaves good lacing behind
Aroma: Warm brown bread, light chocolate notes, wafts of licorice, a little toffee, and mild earthy notes
Taste: Rich bready malt, toffee, and chocolate are the initial notes and after they settle, some nice light licorice appears along with some earthiness. The flavors all meld well before brown bread and chocolate take hold and close it out
Mouthfeel: Full but light, very clean, medium-high carbonation, and a soft and clean finish
Overall: I dig it. I love these folks’ Belgian offerings so scoring this as part of their mix 12-pack was a fun and tasty chance to revisit. The licorice notes make it unique tasting and smelling and they work well here in my opinion plus help set this apart from other Euro Dark Lagers (which although this is an ale, feels/tastes like a lager). Unique, well-made, and tasty",4.03
1554,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. The appearance of the beer resembles a sort of cola/mahogany color, with more than a finger's worth of fluffy tan head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: very malty, and rich notes of coffee and chocolate/cocoa. Other notes of toffee, subtle vanilla, licorice, spices, cherries, raisins, bread crust, yeast, and cinnamon.

Really tasting dark chocolate, coffee, and toffee on the palette, along with the spices, licorice, and subtle vanilla most especially. Essentially follows the aroma. Body is medium-light.",4.0
1554,"Appearance is black, not quite pitch black; ruby red/dark brown highlights. The tan head is absurdly creamy and thick for what appeared to be low carbonation initially. Long-lasting retention and sheets of lacing.

On the nose I get lots of chocolate, a little bit of coffee and vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon or some vague spice note.

Chocolate dominates the palate, hitting upfront with hints of vanilla, dark brown bread in the middle, a touch of plum and balsamic vinegar, and maybe just a vague hint of generic spice. Finishes quick dry with a dusting more of cocoa powder, before finishing more abruptly than expected into cleanness.

The mouthfeel is medium, moderately carbonated, well carbonated and slightly pillow. Finishes crisper and lighter than expected, given the chewiness of the mid-palate.

...Overall, well a solid beer. I had to know idea what style of this beer was going in. I thought it was a Belgian dark ale and reviewed it as such! Surprise, surprise...well, it's pretty solid for a Euro black lager!",4.03

1554,"The beer pours dark brown with a creamy tan head. The head has real staying power!!!! Nice lacing. Aroma of chocolate, cherry, malt, and hint of banana. Taste is dark chocolate, cream, and picking up that slight hint of banana again. The mouthfeel is one of the best I have had. The bear is creamy and soft, almost the consistency of a melted milkshake. This is an outstanding beer! Nice job New Belgium!!",4.26
1554,"Purchased as a 12-bottle variety pack from Sam's Club for $15.90. Poured into a nonic pint glass.

L - Dark, molasses brown with a barely one-finger coffee brown head. Laces well.
S - Raisin, cacao, and dark breads. Slight ethanol.
T - Dark chocolate and stone fruit, washed over by pumpernickel and caramel. Light licorice and toffee finish. Not bitter in the slightest.
F - Sticky. Silky. Full-bodied, with light carbonation. Definitely on the heavier side.
O - A fantastic beer on its own, but even better when paired with steak! Great for a colder night. Couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, I'm afraid. Would highly recommend trying at least once. Will purchase again if I see it.",4.16
IPA,"I haven’t had this IPA for a while. Good to revisit in light of all the unbalanced weird flavored IPAs I’ve been tasting in the past few years. Mildly hoppy, good malt backbone, standard fare. Good go to IPA.",3.92
IPA,"A solid starter IPA of the traditional back in the day variety, I drank a ton of it for a while - similar to, but inferior to in every aspect the great SNPA.",3.75
IPA,"pours a slightly hazed gold body with a billowing white frothy foam head that has moderate retention and leaves a ton of thin sticky sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a patchy froth cap with defined halo

aroma is sweet and grainy, malt forward with floral and slightly piney hops on the wings

taste is sweet and juicy, with a floral flair up front that fades to an earthy light bitterness tinged with pine with the finish

mouthfeel in fairly thin bodied with high carbonation, running slightly watery and grainy with a pillowed, juicy edge before finishing mildly dry and leaving a slightly sweet herbal aftertaste tinged with earthy bitterness

overall:
solid session IPA that runs mostly sweet and juicy but manages a solid balance thanks to a cascade hop bittersweetness.
wouldn't consider it one of the greats, but it's in the top 15 for me as far as highbrow craft IPA flagships.",3.74
IPA,"Not one of the better ones I have had from Harpoon, but still solid enough to enjoy. Comparatively speaking, it's not as sweet smelling or juicy as others, but the mouthfeel was full-bodied which made up for a less than favorable taste. Again, when you take it all in, it's solid. Just not necessarily memorable.",3.22
IPA,"Look...darker brown copper with a white head and ample carbonation . The way IPAs used to look
Smell...faint smell of hops as the usual like many of the old school favorites.
Taste...Exquisite apricot, malt bitter with a very full body for the ABV. Back to the taste, apricot leaving to a finish dryness
Feel...A n ample carbonation that makes the consistency a little sticky and resinous. A great quality to this beer.
Overall...My belief is slanted such as this beer was a staple for a long time. This was my requested wedding beer that had to be there!! Anyways this beer was a very good one and still everyone should try. This beer was definitely a trail blazer out east.",3.95
IPA,"Scrappy notes from 2010.
6 pack of 12 ounce bottles purchased chilled.
This is probably the lightest tasting and lightest drinking IPA that I've had to date. It has a beautiful copper color with a nice white head. The nose is pretty full with hops that are flowery and some malt. The taste is mainly hoppy and is a bit thin or watery but tasty nonetheless. It has a nice light bitterness to it and drinks easy and fast. Not too shabby.",3.36
IPA,"The claim is ""New England's First IPA"" and that may be. Most beer historians credit Ballantine as being the first to brew one in the U.S., but that was in New York. Enough history, let's empty a twelve ounce can into a clear Imperial pint glass and review it. First, it's a lovely bright copper-amber with a sparse, but enduring white head. There's plenty of malt to be had by the nose. The taste is sharply hoppy, with the malt failing to keep up. The hops are boldly bitter, earthy, yet finishing dryly. This is a good bitterly hopped AIPA, lacking only a little malty counterbalance. It may not offer enough complexity for some, but this is a spot on traditional IPA.",4.39
IPA,"From a 19.2oz can, dated 04/05/21. Served in a willi becher.

Pours a crystal clear copper-gold with two fingers of dense, foam insulation-like head. Retention is excellent, leaving a thick, creamy cap and a tattered curtain of lacing. Honestly, I wasn’t prepared for it to look this good.

Nose is sharp, grainy and vaguely cider-like. Crackers and apple skins.

Taste is dry like soda crackers, crisp and biting. Apple skin, orange oil, turpentine.

Feel is crisp and clean, drying, medium bodied with brisk carbonation.

There was a time I drank quite a lot of this and I guess I wasn’t as stupid as I remember myself being because this is mighty tasty. The fact that it’s only a month old may have something to do with it. At any rate, the can label promises ‘hoppy, balanced, crisp’ and fucked if it isn’t all of those things.

(Replaces a 3.48 rating-without-review dated 05/17/15).",3.92
IPA,"Overall this beer is just a snooze fest. Its a cheap beer and i get that, but this is not a good beer. There is nothing overly offensive about this beer but it just taste like water. Not what i expected for and i feel at this price, there are better options that will make you much more happy.",2.89
IPA,"Sometimes you just need a break from the hazy IPAs that occupy every store and every corner of the refrigerator. And sometimes you don’t even want an IPA. This Pale Ale takes me back to some of my first craft beers, before IBUs started hitting sky high. And because of that it is like so many other pale ales, clear and clean, with a nice squeeze of hops and a refreshing palate that would be very difficult to replicate in a higher gravity style.",3.19
IPA,"This is a really nice, balanced IPA. It has a very clear, rich, honey color. The taste is a little bitter with bright citrus notes. It's pretty easy drinking, full feeling, and goes well with rich or spicy foods.",4.21
IPA,"From a can.

Pours a golden, copper in color with a thin layer of head. Not much lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks spot on. Aroma is very floral with some herbal spiciness, bubblegum and a toasty, biscuity malt backbone. Taste follows the nose surprisingly well. Spicy, earthy, floral hops with some lemon, grapefruit and pine balanced out by a toasty, biscuit malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with subdued but lively carbonation and a little bit of chewiness. Pretty drinkable. Overall a solid offering that is balanced and offers some complexity, but it's a bit too spicy/piney for my preference. Cheers!",3.6
IPA,"Poured from 12 oz bottle, bottled on date: 01/06/2020. Nice golden color with a dissipating white head
Malty on the nose, like toasted nuts and slight floral hops and hint of pine
Taste is hop forward, citrus to the back and hint of floral, distinct malt, but on the bready, biscuity side
Feel is medium bodied, but a bit too over carbonated
The first time I tasted this ale was at the end of 1997 and it was on draught at Christopher's in Cambridge and it was fantastic. It has lost that wonderful floral, malt smooth balance it had back then. But still a pretty good ale for the money (usually the lower priced option of the choices)
Edit: I have since read some other reviews and one or two have dissed the beer according to where they bought it on draught. Beware. There is a big variation in how this is kept in bars and restaurants. I recommend trying it local to Harpoon, Boston and in a place that looks after their beers, such as the brewery itself, of course",3.67
IPA,"A classic on the Boston beer circuit since the mid 80’s and one that I consistently find myself ordering at restaurants and bars. A very reliably west cost style IPA that that tantalizes your tastebuds with crisped malty goodness. For those of us at 1009, this is the standard for the style that all others are compared to. For the love of beer!",3.95
Nelson,"Can with unreadable date. GL Tulip.

A: pours a turbid hazy yellow with three fingers of meringue-like frothy white head. No visible carbonation; it’s too hazy.

S: from a foot away I can smell the sweet, tropical fruitiness. Like papaya and gooseberries in syrup.

T: on first arrival, hop burn; tangy, tart, tropical, citric, floral, ending on a grapefruit rind light bitterness. There is a lingering bitterness that I actually find unpleasant. I think it’s the rye. I love rye whiskey, but I can’t think of a single rye beer I’ve liked - including this one. The hop burn and sweetness on the arrival make it unpleasant, as does the weird rye finish.

M: lighter side of medium, pillow-soft.

O: I saw this on the shelf ten years ago, and wanted to buy it but passed it up. I didn’t start seeing it here again until a year ago, and that’s post AB acquisition. I wasn’t willing to get a six, but I saw a single today and wasn’t going to miss it again. When this beer came out, ten years ago, it was revolutionary. Not so much today. Its beautiful to look at and smell, and is still a great example of the hazy IPA style, but strikes me as too fruity and unpleasant on the finish. At least it’s got a good name.",4.04
Nelson,"Nice golden hue and minimal head.
Earthy and floral notes.
Malty backbone, bitterness is on point here.
Good carbonation, nice balance.chewy.
I can't find flaws, great drinking beer.",4.37
Nelson,"Picked up a six pack of cans based on the rating. Best by date of 08/13/22.

Pours a clear, golden orange with hints of amber and a lovely half inch of frothy head. Carbonation looks slightly below average. A good amount of lacing as you drink, some slides and some clings. Looks as expected.

Interesting, the aroma is overall a bit sour -- wasn't expecting that. Grape, stone fruit, cantaloupe, some pine and a bit of funky earthiness and spice. Malts are lingering in the background with a light toastiness. Not sure I will like this based on the aroma, but here we go.

Has a kind of ""green"" flavor. Overall a bit sour, just like the aroma hinted. Spicy and piney hops mixed with stone fruit, cantaloupe, grape... not getting a lot of citrus or tropical fruitiness, perhaps some mango. The malts just kinda chill in the background, lending some toastiness, and maybe some of that sourness as well. Finishes pretty crisp and dry with lingering grape and grapefruit bitterness. Also getting a hint of wood near the swallow and into the finish. Well, this is certainly complex but comes off a bit like a hoppy wine... interesting.

An excellent mouthfeel. Medium bodied with average but zesty carbonation and a good amount of body/chewiness. Drinks very smooth.

I can see why this is highly rated, there is a lot of complexity in the flavor profile and it's quite unique. I can't think of another IPA I've had that tastes like this. That said, I don't really care for it. I'm going to struggle through the rest of this six pack and probably will not seek this one out again.",3.62
Nelson,"On tap at a reputable establishment. This was a hazy, pale yellow. Pretty bland overall, faint grape, muted tropical fruit, mild honey sweetness. Certainly not bad but definitely disappointing.",3.55
Nelson,"12 oz can (“PKGD 01/10/22”) poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass. Hazy amber gold with a thick, rocky head of white foam and streaky lace. Layered aromas of orange citrus, pine, stone and tropical fruit. More fruit follows in the taste with orange citrus, melon and tropical fruit, slight rye spice, pine resin and dank notes. Finishes crisp, bitter and dry. Medium body, smooth feel and moderate carbonation. Densely flavorful with plenty of unique hop character.",4.25
Nelson,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (100%), pale yellow color with a large, white head. SRM of 6. One of the haziest and most opaque beers I have seen. (4.50)

Aroma: Absolutely giant aromas of mandarin orange, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, citrus, and more tropical fruit. Green Cantaloupe Melon. Even some cinnamon spice. A bit of herbal qualities underneath. Extremely juicy and green. Huge green citrus and tropical banana.

Flavor: A giant bomb of biting mandarin orange citrus, marmalade, orange pulp, green banana, pineapple, green mango, gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon altogether. Extremely green and juicy citrus with pine underneath. Finishes sweet and juicy. The green fruit is showcased here mostly in a Citra format, however some gooseberry and grape underneath, but less than I expected.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Sweet and biting. Leaves a green juiciness on the palate that is palate-wrecking.

Compared to Lagunitas Stereohopsis Volume 1, 1/3/21: Pours a lighter and much hazier color. Stronger and juicier aromas. Much more fruity and hazier. The Nelson evolves into more of a green citrus rather than green orchard fruit. More citrus, less orchard-fruit. Overall, quite a similar flavor from the Nelson which is interesting. Finishes much juicier, sweeter, but possibly a lighter body.

Compared to Toppling Goliath Pseudo Sue 1/2/22: Pours slightly hazier. Milder aromas. More mandarin orange, marmalade, and cantaloupe. Less lemon citrus and citrus flower.

Compared to Surly's Axe Man IPA 2/6/22: Pours a lighter and hazier color. Milder aromas. More gooseberry, grape, and deep and resinous tropical and berry notes. Less citrus peel, pineapple, pine, flower, and flavor complexity.

Compared to Stone Deliciousness IPA 3/4/22: Pours a hazier and lighter color. Stronger aromas. More grapefruit, sweet lemon, yellow, and green plastic flavors. Less grapefruit citrus, tangerine, and pine. Slightly less bitter. More grape flavor

Overall: What a giant and juicy IPA. Fantastic mandarin orange, pulp, green gooseberry, and cantaloupe melon flavors. Even some slight cinnamon spice. You could brush your teeth with this beer. Palate cleansing and green. The Nelson doesn't provide the green grape/gooseberry/orchardfruit I was expecting and leans more citrus. Almost like the Citra hop. Actually tastes quite similar to Toppling Goliath's PseudoSue. Would be worth a comparison to PseudoSue, Axe Man, or KIng Sue if I manage to pick this one up again. So dense, so juicy, and so good. (Final Rating: 4.48)",4.48
Nelson,"Pours a hazy orange into a paper hotel coffee cup with a big 3"" head, excellent retention and lacing despite the vessel. Nose is tropical juice at first before turning into floral honey and pine as it warms; a hint of malt, grain, and maybe some diesel (though might be the cup). Taste is nicely balanced between sweet, juicer hop elements and a lingering bitterness on the finish. Super smooth on the palate with no hint of alcohol. Glad to finally give it a try.",4.45
Nelson,"Canned 3/10/21. Consumed from a tulip glass 8/6/21. I would have liked to have tried a fresher version, but smell and taste were both examples of the Nelson hop. Disappointing Look: very small head that was very short lived and there were solids in the beer. It was hazier than I expected. Quite hoppy. My ratings here are somewhat generous and take into account the possible effect of canning date vs. consumption date. With all the great IPAs out there I did not feel that this was a stellar example worth repeating. I was very surprised to see a 98 pt rating.",3.82
Nelson,"It smells like fresh pine and a little dank. Then the more I smell it i get some breadwater sweetness but the piny hops are the predominant scent.

Oh yeah, now I get the hype. The taste is so clean. First it's barely sweet with a hint of pine and then it's a really bright piny hoppiness.

It's not quite as thin as most IPAs with a medium body.  The finish is bitter and then dank. It lasts for a long time.

Overall it is one of the better IPAs I've had.  It's smooth, balanced and incredibly refreshing. I give this one a really great 5.7 out of 6.",4.85
Nelson,"Look is opaque orange and more hazy than you would think. Nice one finger of white head with decent retention. Smell is white white and cedar with notes of tropical fruits.

This beer is outstanding and worth its reputation",4.24
Nelson,"From a 12oz can dated 3/9/21 into a weizen glass.

Pours an opaque orangish yellow with about two and a half fingers of white head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Smells of oranges, faint grapes, pineapple and pine.

Taste...Getting a white wine vibe along with slight citrus acidity (not off-putting). Oranges and grapefruit in the background.

Soft, smooth mouthfeel. Low carbonation. Slight bitter aftertaste.

Overall, a really decent beer with an interesting taste.",4.17
Nelson,"It pours a golden straw color with a nice sized head.
There are aromas of rye and tropical fruit.
I’m not usually a fan of Rye IPAs. But this one is very nice The hops work very well with the rye to give it a unique rye and tropical flavor.
It has a nice body and mouthfeel.
Leaves a nice aftertaste. The rye works well with the bitterness.


Overall, this is an excellent ipa highlighted by the rye and tropical flavors with just enough bitterness for a good punch.",4.19
Nelson,"Pours well out of a can, head looks good, foam clings to glass, etc. Very hazy with some larger particulates floating around.

White wine-like characteristics of the hop prominent in smell, along with some mango/tropical fruit.

The most prominent flavor is ripe mango both in flavor profile and sweetness. Not getting much else but mango is awesome so that's a plus.

Robust feel but still dangerously smooth and easy to put down, even at 7%.

Would buy on sight, wife--approved and she hates IPAs.",4.57

Raison D'Être,"32oz crowler purchased two days ago at J's Liquor Owensboro poured into a DFH branded teku glass at fridge temp 8% ABV. The beer pours mostly bright medium brown with ruby highlights and essentially no head. No retention or lacing. The aroma is faint brown sugar and maybe a hint of dark fruit. The taste is slightly sugary, with raisin flavor before an alcohol hot, barely bitter finish. Not real complex and scary close to cherry cough syrup. The mouthfeel is medium plus bodied with below average carbonation and anundry finish. Overall, subpar. I got a stupid deal on this crowler ($5) and I imagine that this keg had been on tap for quite a while with the restrictions on shopping. I would still try this from a dated bottle or a bar that does a brisk business. Numerically rated close to the existing average for fairness.",3.49
Raison D'Être,"Pours a dark nutty brown with a hint of burgundy. Head is a finger of khaki foam. Head retention is good. Aroma is strong - plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and caramely malts. A little bit of alcohol seeps through, but just barely. Flavor profile carries the same profile forward, hitting notes of plum, dark fruits, raisins, fig and toffee with caramely, nutty malts underneath. Alcohol is a little more apparent here. Mouth feel is full with a medium-thick consistency that firms up to 'thick' when the glass has been warmed slightly. Light graininess adds a little texture to each sip. Overall, heavy and full with strong raisins and dark fruit qualities.

Titan IPA,"Poured from a can into tulip glass a huge 3F mid tan foamy head forms that settles quickly with loose lace from the top to bottom. Color is a coppery dull amber and is about 70% transparent.

The nose presents a nose that is vegetal as in produce department variety, with just a bit of an off note that I can only describe as veg decay, bong water or over fermented mash. It hints that I am going to be hit with a somewhat dank malty hop bomb.

Big slightly toasted malty mash on the palate with a dry danky bitterness. It starts lightly sweet and smooth on the tongue with a fairly strong toasted grain vibe and ends with lightly dry finish with a danky bitterness. This dank is nowhere as near offputting as the nose.

Mouthfeel is medium with a round slickness and warmth to the taste. Carbonation is light and bubbles are fine. Some alcohol tang on the end .

Wow, what an odd beer. The nose really is doing me in, some bong water mixed with beer is what I get. Not good. Taste is another matter as it is decent yet I cannot enjoy it because you have to breath. Maybe I got a bad can but it is still less than 2 months old.

It pours a really nice dense black with scant tan head - again 5 years old...so my fault on the head.
Amazing nose with chocolate, cinnamon spice and vanilla - perhaps a hint of roasty coffee - but the spice notes are just right.
Taste is smooth with chocolate note, vanilla sweetness and cinnamon spice, yet maintains a bit of a roast coffee note also with a hint of bitterness.
Despite the limited head, this maintains a brisk carbonation and a beautifully silky creamy mouthfeel. Hopefully Stone (Sapporo) sends some fresh stuff north to Canada as pretty sure this 5 year old bottle was the last time sold here....",4.37

In any event, this particular brew is black in color. It boasts a thick, lasting, tan head. The nose is muted initially; it is faintly redolent of sweetness, cream, and spice.

It is creamy and medium-bodied in feel.

The palate stuns me. Beautiful flavors of dark chocolate and coffee meld flawlessly with a variety of spices. The spice component is perfect; it is not overdone.

Xocoveza,"I’m a big fan of winter stouts. Picked up a six pack at the local beer distributor. Pour very dark, nice aroma. Taste was different from other stouts I have had. Was skeptical at first. By the end of the six pack, I was a believer. Went back to pick up another six pack a week and a half later, gone.",4.05
Xocoveza,"Pouring this nearly black can of awesomeness into a pint glass produced a 1"" tan head that had excellent retention and lacing. This beer looks just wonderful.

Aroma was complex. At cellar temperature: Mexican chocolate, peppers, vanilla, faint cinnamon. It was like smelling an aromatic puzzle where all the pieces fit together perfectly.

Taste: Just wow. Taste follows the nose. This is just the right level of sweetness for a holiday stout. The peppers and cinnamon provide just a touch of lingering heat, and the chocolate gives you a bit of unsweetened bitterness. This is really a wonderful beer - strong competition for Prairie's Christmas Bomb.

Mouthfeel toes the line between medium and full bodied, which is a perfect compliment to the flavor profile. This is just thick enough for the big, bold flavors, but also incredibly smooth.

Overall: I am filled with regret that I only bought a single. This will be a six pack next year. Just....wow.",4.77
Xocoveza,"12oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $2.99. Canned on 9/16/20, so this exactly 3 months old. I only cooled this in the fridge for a short time, and I gave it some time to come closer to room temperature for a while before opening. Seems to be the right temperature - just cool but not cold. Could even probably drink this at cellar temperature and it would be good.

Look: Pours almost pitch black with light brown highlights. Has a very nice looking fluffy brown head. The head dissipated slowly; a very thin head is lingering. Tiny bubbles are slowly rising to the surface.

Smell: This has a very nice, complex aroma. The first things that I get are coffee, cocoa powder, fruity chili pepper, and roasty toasty malts. The back end has cinnamon and nutmeg. Hard to pick up the vanilla on the nose, but it could easily be blending in with the chocolate and other aromas. After drinking, I can pick up on a vanilla cream note in the nose on the front end that is reminiscent of cream soda, very nice. Gives some nutty roasted almond notes too that are quite nice. A mild earthy hop aroma and acidity on the finish as well. This smells like Mexican hot chocolate and it smells delicious!

Taste: Wow, this is a lot sweeter than I expected. It at least has a perceived sweetness initially. It's very smooth and drinkable. This is a dangerous beer at 8.1% ABV. The flavors in this beer meld together very nicely; to me they are more discernible on the nose than in the mouth. Up front, you get spiced coffee/hot chocolate notes and sweetness that quickly transition to a roasty, slightly bitter finish with a lingering spicy chili pepper. The finish has really nice unsweetened chocolate notes, along with some fruitiness from the chocolate and pasilla pepper. The finish has a lot of sweetness also; you can tell your brain what you want to focus on - bitter or sweet. I get a lot of spiced nut notes on the finish as well.

Feel: Mouthfeel is really nice - on the thicker side of medium body. Slightly chewy and pefectly carbonated for this type of beer.

Overall: A really delicious adjunct stout. Is this a pastry stout? I have heard so much about pastry stouts, but I don't actually know how to characterize one and whether this is in or out. Regardless, it's a very delicious beer. With all the specialty ingredients that they put in, you sure hope that it would come out delicious but they could have easily messed up such a complicated recipe. Kudos to Stone for finding the right balance to express all of these flavors without overpowering the beer.

Note: Lactose added.",4.49
Xocoveza,"From a can. This pours a dark coffee cola color with heaping layers of creamy foam. Nice dusting of cinnamon on the nose, and what I think of an ancho chile note. Dry finish, with some cacao in the back, and more cinnamon.",4.22
Xocoveza,"Not a whole lot to say that hasn't been said already. This beer looks, smells, and tastes fantastic. Make sure you let it warm up a bit so you can fully appreciate everything it brings to the table.",4.68
Xocoveza,"Pours very dark with a big foamy head that slowly fades. Big chocolate aroma mixes with pepper, smokey. Flavor is chocolate, coffee, some smoky pepper, vanilla, faint cinnamon. Light to medium bodied, has a bitter espresso finish. Overall a good stout, I would expect it to be thicker, richer, and creamier.

Xocoveza,"I purchased a March 2018 bottle and consumed it 8 months past the best by date. Despite being supposedly old it was creamy, mellow and smooth. Not much pepper or heat.

Fast forward to 2020: I finally found this fresh, canned 5 weeks ago. Red chile pepper meets nutmeg, tobacco, dark chocolate, cinnamon, lactose, cocoa and char. It's not especially thick but there's enough creaminess to cut the heat and it never gets too sweet.

This is a really nice stout.",4.21
Leffe Blonde,"Highly drinkable and refreshing. Hits with a pleasant yeasty flavor immediately, with a lemony zest. Fairly light body for easy drinking, with gentle sparkling carbonation. No real surprises as you continue to drink, just a pleasant and dependable ale.",4.42
Leffe Blonde,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a goblet. Looks dark golden, almost amber color with a creamy white head that fell to a cap. Some lacing coats the glass as I drink. Smell is spice, clove, cinnamon, banana bread. Taste starts sweet and spicy with banana and clove dominating. Middle sees a bit of candied fruit and then a dose of hops brings some bitterness to the front. Finish is candi sugar and spice. Aftertaste is subdued. Feel is light bodied, prickly carbonation, and a bit of dryness in the finish. Overall, not a style I seek out, but this is a good beer that's interesting to drink.",3.81

Leffe Blonde,"Look: This pours deep yellow and clear with three fingers of head that could easily be more, regular bubbling, very attractive ber.

Aroma: Bread, bananas, sweet, yeast, and a hint of cloves.
Taste: Vanilla, Banana, Caramel, Cloves, and even a hint of cinnamon, extremely smooth ending in a light hoppy bitterness.

Feel: Syrupy and highly carbonated. Will additionally fizz if you swish it around in your mouth. Quite a full mouthfeel.

Overall: An excellent and very high quality Blonde Ale, probably the best beer I've tasted in this class.",4.83
Leffe Blonde,"Look: Pours a light orange shade of brass with a one finger, finely compacted head of white foam. Great lacing and head retention.

Aroma: Bananas foster, bubblegum, slightly spicy notes of clove and vanilla bean.

Taste: Bananas foster in a bottle.

Feel: Full bodied. Full carbonation.

Overall: A phenomenal Belgian blonde ale. Just an overall excellent taste, aroma and mouthfeel. Very pleasant to drink.",4.23
Leffe Blonde,"purchased from the neighborhood drug store. Poured over ice fresh from the bottle. Pours a straw golden yellow, smells of malted bananas. Frothy mouth feel, a decent amount of fizz. It reminds me of sitting in the garden all day and talking about the end of world while titrating amphetamine salts and discussing how the government controls the weather. Its a beer you find open but mostly full on the deck the next the next morning while cleaning up and decide to skull it anyway. Is it a good example of the style no, is it a little different and you know what it will be with no surprises, yes.",3.26

Leffe Blonde,"11.2oz gold foil topped bottle into big mug while in the town chat

Clear and puffy white head. Smell is sweet cereal malt and clove. Very, overly sweet and slick feeling. This is probably the best thing InBev makes (even if they do this on the sly)

It is just okay for a Belgian ale, but sometime this is all you can find",3.39
Leffe Blonde,"Appearance: Clear gold, good head.

Smell: Skunk at first, then cloves and phenol-y yeast.

Taste: Bubblegum sweetness throughout with some cloves and phenolic yeast notes in the finish.

Overall: Decided to try this after seeing it a fair amount on the WBAYDN? Thread. I don't usually go for the Belgian pale ales, but this was enjoyable. I liked the bubblegum note and the yeast notes were complementary instead of distracting. Now I'll have to try their brown ale.",3.65

Velvety, tan head. Thick and bold, black looking elixir. Soft, dark and caramelized, roasted grains, for the aroma. Slightly watered down, dark roasted grain and dark chocolate flavor that is OK.",3.62
Chocolate Stout,"This beer is really good. Beautiful opaque look with a smaller dark khaki head. First sip and you already taste the chocolate. This isn’t your normal dark chocolate stout, this is a milk chocolate flavor and it is good. Probably higher on the calories so probably only have one, but if you get the chance to try it, do it.",4.69

Chocolate Stout,On tap at Das Beer Garden. Black body with a nice creamy khaki head. Smells of cocoa and roasted malt. Tastes of cocoa and roar malt as well. Milk chocolate without the milk. Roasted malt and light bitterness in its stead. Medium body and very drinkable. Low carbonation. Hitting some of the old classics and this does not disappoint.,3.53
Chocolate Stout,"1 pt. 6 fl. oz. bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Black colour, huge brown head. Sweetish aroma with strong notes of chocolate / cocoa, also notes of vanilla.

A: pours dark brown, blackish body with small, tan head with ok retention and lacing
S: smells like sweet, cocoa, dark chocolate; smells like a sweet chocolate bar

M: pretty smooth and solid
D: nice mouthfeel and taste combo; good overall; a bit medicinal",3.84
Chocolate Stout,"A: Pours a nice rocky head. The head looks like chocolate milk so great start so far. Color is almost completely opaque. The little light that filters through shows a dark brown.

S: Smells of luscious chocolate. A good amount of sweetness, almost like frosting. Nice nuttiness and the malt character really comes through.

T: The cocoa is so present, but never seems to take center stage. The milky creaminess starts and is just so mellow. The roasted malts and the bitterness builds beautifully until the hop spice pops the bubble and clears the pallet. It finishes with a long drawn out chocolate aftertaste. The hops are a bit distracting and I honestly wished there was a lot less hops. It balances the drink and cleanses the palate, but I never feel like I get to fully bathe in the richness before being snapped out of it.

O: This is the adult version of a chocolate milk. So smooth, so drinkable. A clear flaw that changes this drink from indulgent to simply great.",4.5
Chocolate Stout,"Poured from a bomber into a Dogfish Head tulip

L: Dark pour... nearly black with big foamy mocha head. Great lacing.

S: Smells fantastic... big roast and milk chocolate.

T.F: Bittersweet roasted malts. Chocolate is present but not nearly as rich as the aroma would lead you to believe... kind of syrupy. Mild coffee... a bit of hop bittering and pine to boot. Lighter bodied than it should be. Fairly smooth. More bittersweet processed cocoa at the finish.

O: This was decidedly average... and nowhere near as good as the rating would have you believe. Looks good. Smells good. Taste... meh. There are WAY better chocolate stouts out there.",3.65
Chocolate Stout,"Disappointing. Smells and looks good, but the chocolate flavoring tastes like the chocolate syrup served at a buffet. I’ll skip this the next time I see it.",3.3

I've turned many people towards dark beer with this one! 50/50 men, women! their dubbel chocolate... an easy 5!",4.35
Chocolate Stout,"Beautiful very dark brown/black appearance. Nice tan head that stays thought drinking it also has great lacing. Smells of dark chocolate, slight smoke, and roasted malt. The taste is as described heavy chocolate taste upfront then the roasted malts and oats come through gets quite bitter on the finish. Too bitter in my opinion could do a better job of balancing the sweet and bitter. Mouth feel is smooth, creamy, medium bodied and quite dry on the finish, nice amount of carbanation.",4.28
Chocolate Stout,Bomber from Albertsons. Near black pour with small creamy beige head. Rich dark chocolate aroma. Taste adds light bitter roast to the chocolate. Velvety feel.,4.0
Chocolate Stout,The pour is jet black with a tan & frothy head. The aroma is of dark chocolate & roasted malts & the taste follows suit. If you're looking for stout with chocolate added to it then look no further because this beer delivers. There is a date on the front of the bottle. I like chocolate stouts but i'm more of a coffee stout drinkers so this beer I would not care to revisit. Cheers! A-,4.03
Chocolate Stout,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewing Co pint glass

A: Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a slight mahogany tint and a frothy cocoa brown head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some thick lacing.

S: Lots of chocolate, cocoa powder, bittersweet, and milk, a little vanilla, roasted malt, a little char, a touch of smoke, earthy, slightly piney, toffee sweetness, and a hint of dark fruit.

T: Roasty, big bittersweet and milk chocolate, a little vanilla, some char and faint smoke, earthy piney bitterness, toffee sweetness, and a touch of dark fruit on the back end, mostly cherry and plum.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy.

O: Definitely lives up to the name, super chocolate-y. My main gripe is how assertive the bitterness is. I feel like if they backed it down 10+ IBU it would be even better.",3.98

Gulden Draak,"To me, this brand has always been synonymous with excellence and authenticity. They seem to always have that Belgian yeast taste and beautiful balance. This is no exception, but as worth the others I've reviewed, it is exceptional.

It pours deep reddish brown with plenty of foam. Gorgeous. The aroma says Belgium. There taste is that malty darkness with yeasty astringent overtones. The experience is always a treat.

Highly recommended. When you need to break out of any kind of funk, this will do it.",4.19
Gulden Draak,"Huge foamy head with a hazy rusty brown body. Smell is lighter than expected; bubblegum, banana, plenty of esters, bread dough, and a hint of coriander.

Nose is dark fruits and malt.

Feel is crazy smooth especially with that ABV.

Years ago, this was my first fancy Belgian ale. It's still great.",4.69
Gulden Draak,"Beautiful beer. Lovely clear red amber, with a big, tan, pillowy, three finger, Belgian head. The aroma is dominated by cherry, caramel, and red wine, with a hint of ethanol. The taste is a symphony of fkavour: berries, caramel, red wine, brown sugar, and noticeable but very well balanced alcohol. This is by far the smoothest and most agreeable 10.5% I've ever had. This is great stuff, and widely available, so get some and enjoy it. If someone wanted to know what Belgian beer is like, I would give him one of these as the archetypal Belgian.",4.25

G'Knight,"Appearance - The beer poured a brownish maroon color with a white head.

Smell - The smell malts and dank hops were just right for the style.

Taste - The malts backbone was huge, leaving a trail of sweetness. The dank and grassy hops provided a nice contrast. Nothing was overpowering, and a dry finish left me thirsty for more.

Mouthfeel - The beer was full bodied, allowing the aftertaste to linger.

Overall - It has been too long since I had this one.",4.25

L: Dark amber with a moderate amount of foam. A slight amount of bubbles. 3.75

S: Hard to put a finger on what this smells like. Smells like it will taste sour. It has notes of a typical IPA, but different. 3.0

T: Tastes about like it smells... kind of weird. It has a harshness that sort of overpowers the other flavors of the beverage. This is a higher ABV than I am accustomed to, which might account for the issues. Bitterness from hops is about the only other thing I can discern. I get no sweetness, at all, even as the brew warmed. 2.75

Caramel malt and maybe even cinnamon come out in the body, but take a back seat to the hops. That being said, the bitterness is well balanced by malt sweetness. Feel is wet, and a lovely warmth is produced by the ABV. It’s a really good beer, and a great take on red ales. My only critique is that the malt character could be a bit more present.",4.0

G'Knight,"Poured from a can into a tulip glass a massive 3F mid tan foamy head sits atop a medium amber beer about 40% transparent. Lace starts at the top and slides down the glass as the head slowly sinks over several minutes.

On the nose I get sweaty salty hops predominantly with hints of yeast and mash and some mystery note.

Taste is caramel malt at first then bitter hop and a boozy finish. The unidentified note is a pine resin hops trying to hide the alcohol astringency. A hint of thymol makes this a bit too booze like for me.

Mouthfeel is medium with medium carbonation that acts as a catalyst to the thymol, piney alcohol and creates a tingly aftertaste. This takes away from the initial malt notes and finishes slick and sticky.

This beer has just too much alcohol and bitterness for me. Parts of the flavor profile hint at schnapps in a beer boilermaker. The Listerine aftertaste is a major turnoff for me. Struggling to get through the rest of the glass, yup drain pour.",2.63

Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Translucent deep brownish-red, with light, quickly-dissipating tan head.

Smell? Think red wine vinegar, softened by (dried, then moistened) cherry, oak and a touch of vanilla. I say ""vinegar"", but it's softer, more rounded than that, and not as strong. A partner of the other elements, not dominating them.

Taste is is dried cherry, a touch of raisin, the aforementioned red wine vinegar, some oak tannin, and a hint of booze-soaked vanilla.

Feel is smooth/slick - it looks at ""lightly syrupy"", but doesn't actually go there - , light-medium, with light, very,very,very fine carbonation tingle. Some acetic mucilaginous feel at the back of the palate, eventually with a slight drying effect in the front.

Overall, just wonderful. I've had this before, but not in a long, long time. I need to not wait so long for the next time. It lives up to billing, and deserves its high ranking. :)",4.35
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Poured from the 11.2 oz bottle into the test glass.
A - A ruddy, brown color, very little cap, very fine carbonation accumulates as a ring along the glass walls
S - Dark cherries, vanilla tannin, oak, some sweet malts, aged balsamic, and green apple skins.
T - Dark stone fruit, some ever so slight vanilla, a bit of late harvest grape, as the offering warms, the earthy elements pop. Grainy malts, with earthy musty threads. This is very complex
M - Medium body, semi sweet, then a shift towars slightly sour. Texture is luxurious, slick with a slightly tart linger.
Very cordial like with the gentle carbonation.
O - A bit of a revelation in 11.2 oz's. Outstanding texture, Softened by oak, the acididty doesn't run wild. The tannin touch is deft. Overall exceptional",4.24
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"More brown than red, slightly hazy, one finger of khaki head. The smell and taste are extremely complex, dominated by fruit, red wine tannins, and vinegar, but in a good way. The flavour of this stuff sure packs a wallop. It finishes with the dominant sourness only slightly mellowed out by sweetness. Overall, a wonderfully complex beer.",4.49
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Excellent brownish-red body with lots of lively carbonation; thick, spongy head. A beautiful aroma of cherry and raspberry; earthy mustiness. The taste flows along with the smell; rich, fruity tartness; raw oak; moderate sourness. Heavy body; velvety residual sugar note; moderate tartness; fairly sweet overall.

This is a fantastically rich and inviting Flanders red ale. It brings all the hallmarks of the beer style to the front. I don't find it overly sour nor over-carbonated and fizzy like some I've experienced. This one is heavy with complexity and nuance.

Rodenbach Grand Cru,"330 ml bottle poured into a tulip glass. There is clear bottling information, but I'm nowhere near smart enough to decipher the code.

L---Opaque brown in my glass, but it was clear with a strong reddish tint while pouring it through light. Fluffy khaki head faded quickly and left ok lacing.

S---You can smell the sourness. Strong fruitiness. Tart cherries.

T---Wow, this is really good. Sour cherries, light red wine vinegar.

F---Much fuller bodied than expected from a relatively light 6.0% ABV.

O---This earns its world class status. So glad I bought two.",4.35
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Poured into a pint glass. A hazy reddish brown with a thin tan head that soon diminished to a ring which stuck around to the end.

Fairly strong clean, sweet and tart fruit smells.

Taste is vinous. Malty and mildly sour up front. A very long sweetish aftertaste. Some oak and leather present. Well melded.

Very smooth for a Flemish Red. Medium to light body and carbonation.

Overall a world class Flemish red. Well balanced and refreshing. Mildly sour, fruity and funky.",4.35
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"Rodenbach Grand Cru is clear and a deep red color, with leathery highlights. Head is dense, packed, cream colored, and lasting.
On the nose, Rodenbach is tart and fruity up front, smelling pleasantly of sour, ripe cherries. I can practically picture the juiciness of those cherries as they fall from the tree straight into my beer. Oak and vanilla lend support while softening the beer’s overall sourness. This may be my imagination but I could swear I find hints of leather hiding behind the aromas of oak. Unbaked bread lends itself to the flavors, helping the oak in its bid to soften those flavors of ripe fruit tartness.
On the tongue, Rodenbach is smooth and medium bodied. CO2 provides a spritzy carbonation that dances across the tongue. Soft flavors of unbaked bread give a platform for up front tartness which combines deftly with flavors of ripe fruit. Flavors give me ripe cherry as well as red grape minus the tannins. The finish has a lot going on each in its own subtle fashion. Chiefly there’s an earthy quality. Earthiness blends nicely with fruit as well as leather tinted flavors of oak. All of which combines to provide a very gentle flavor profile.
Like previous Flanders Reds, this one has some great character and great balance. Tartness and flavors of ripe fruit dominate without overpowering. Oak aging and a general bready quality help prevent this beer from being too strong in its tartness. Rather, it’s a delicious, refreshing, and greatly accessible example of the style.",4.18
Rodenbach Grand Cru,"I'll keep this brief - wonderful classic beer. It's one of those beers that I've seen on the shelf for years without trying. Now I wonder what took so long.

Over the last several months, the Flanders Red style has emerged as on of my favorites. So much flavor to be had here!",4.4
Hercules Double IPA,"Citrus hints and malt dominates this dipa and the hops come in the form of deep woods/ pine forest. Other more non-description tropical fruits appear as this warms. You’ll hear others say this really comes to life as it warms. I agree. Tasty stuff. Big pine notes with plenty of sweet nutty/ tea-like malts without the sweetness being a turnoff. Like many also note, the hops don’t dominate here.",4.0
Hercules Double IPA,"The can I have isn't expired but not the freshest but this is so malty im wondering if they some how canned a brown ale. If this how this normally is then it's honestly awful to me. Zero hops just malt, like this is so disappointing I'll have to try again to see.


Seeing as how I have the lowest review on here I looked at others and they're all as flabbergasted as I am. I really hope we all got bad bottles or cans and it will be better next time.


Update, after trying again I more or less confirmed what I thought while also liking this more. Still not for me but for those more into malty IPA'S.",3.32
Hercules Double IPA,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 9.1%., 85 IBU. Orange to amber colour, slightly hazy. Moderate but lasting off-white head with an orangey hue. Pleasant aroma of fruity American hops. The flavour is an aggressive hoppy explosion from start to finish, on a malty sweet (too sweet?) background. Very bitter aftertaste. ""Not for the faint of heart"" - but I MIGHT get used to this ... I’m upping it a point. Original rating: Bottle, at The Rover, Göteborg. Amber colour, hazy. Sweet and alcoholic aroma and flavour, but also plenty of hops, as expected from a ""double IPA"". A bit overdone on both sweetness and hops in my book, but still a good beer.",3.61
Hercules Double IPA,"Six pack of cans purchased at Total Wine in Lynnwood, Washington.
Canned on SEP 24 2019. Poured in to an Erdinger pint glass.

Look- Slightly hazy darker golden amber color, glorious off-white head that slowly recedes, beautiful lacing. Light carbonation streaming as it sits.

Smell- Citrus (tangerine, grapefruit and lemon), honey/caramel malts, resinous pine, over-ripe tropical fruits (mango, passionfruit and light pineapple), some stone fruit. Light spicy/herbal notes.

Taste- The honey sweet malts are much more prevalent in the taste than the aroma. The hoppy fruitiness and pine assert themselves in the finish, well balanced.

Feel- Rich, full bodied with faint alcohol tones. Very smooth with a solid semi-dry bitter finish. Moderate carbonation on the tongue.

O- A really nice DIPA. A little pricey but I'll be coming back to this one.",4.04
Hercules Double IPA,"From notes 1/22/12: Pours deep gold/pale amber with 2 fingers of frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head which leaves a heavy, pasty lacing behind as it recedes. Aroma is citrusy orange hops and sweet caramel malts. Taste is huge hoppiness! Oily with orange zest in a malt background of cane syrup and caramel. Big hop bite and bitterness from start into the aftertaste. Taste is complex, almost in an abbey ale sort of way. Alcohol is well hidden for a 10% ABV until the brew reaches room temperature where it blossoms.",4.28
Hercules Double IPA,"Found this at T0tal W!ne in Houston after missing it on the local shelves for several years.
Probably more than a bit overpriced i.e. you can find better brews for less money. But, it's an excellent beer, good taste but not overly hopped and little or no juniper or other cringe-worthy (for some people!) ingredients. Herc is a very worthwhile brew which has been around for quite a while. If you're looking to test drive an IPA, this is a great choice.",4.29
Raging Bitch,"""For optimal freshness enjoy by 9/14/22""; drank 7/2/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through golden appearance.

A rough pour yielded a big khaki head; strong, frothy tree-rung lace.

Fresh soap, mild corn & faint dry wheat notes in the nose.

Sticky medium mouthfeel.

Fresh soap & mild orange peel flavors up front; dry clove notes and some booze heat on the finish.

A bit off-putting; not so much a melding of styles, as a clashing of styles. Abrasive.",3.5
Raging Bitch,"Poured on tap at DCA airport in DC. The beer is a clear dark orange color with a frothy off-white head. Strong Belgian yeast aroma with brown sugar and balancing malt. Taste is balanced with a slight bitter kick at the end. Like a Belgian funnel throughout, lots of brown sugar, caramel, banana bread, spice. Finishes with a surprising pine not which brings it back to the IPA aspect of things. A really fun take on a Belgian brew with a lot of similarities but also some surprises. Recommended.",4.25
Raging Bitch,"A very nice amber pour, an pale yellow meringue head that lingered and some really nice lacing. Boogar factory said Belgian yeast, taste buds said Belgian yeast, brain said ""nope, this won't work"". Medium bodied, great lasting carbonation. I just dont like Belgian yeast.",3.36

3.5 out of 5......If you like lagers, you will love this beer!",3.32
Raging Bitch,"Pours an opaque copper color with a monstrously thick off white colored head that dissipates unevenly leaving tons of lacing. Smell is floral with the complexities of the Belgian yeast present. Has a strong malt backbone with a balanced tropical fruit taste and bitter finish. Mouth is just shy of syrupy but oh so enjoyable. Can remember splitting a 6 with a work colleague @ lunch and not wanting to get much done after that thus calling it a ""Raging Bitch"" kind'a day. A staple that I always try to have on hand in order to turn friends onto. Love the artwork & name.",4.17
Raging Bitch,"A hazy copper pour, fat head and curtain lacing. Impressive. The nose is quiet medicinal, a bit of lemon. Taste is pungent herbal bitterness, as promised, with pretty solid malts that sit as a firm foundation for the punchy hops. Dry and taxing, this is not one I groove to, but it’s alright.",3.89
Raging Bitch,"2022 re-review

A decent interpretation of a belgian IPA, not really anything to write home about but not terrible. Deffinitely has more of an IPA than a belgian character, that can be a good or a bad thing depending on what youre looking for.

Pours a translucent orange/brass color with a one finger off white head that laces the glass well.
Aroma is bitter and herbal, fairly nondescript besides notes of grapefruit rind and caramel.

Malt bill is strong and competes for control with the hops. Has a sweet caramel / honey / candied orange flavor predominantly. Yeasty belgian flavor only appears on the aftertaste, its nice but not as bold as I would have expected - showcasing decent flavors of banana and very mild clove. Finishes bitter and dry with hoppy notes of orange zest.

Mid weight body. Alcohol profile is moderate, you can tell its almost 9% yet at the same time this is oddly sessionable.

This is an enjoyable beer for sure; I come back to it every now and then when I want something thirst quenching but strong in ABV.",3.73
Raging Bitch,3/1/21....pours medium copper amber with light head of off white foam. Cherry fruit and yeasty nose. Spicy fruity flavor. Some cherry. Black currants too. Deep and powerful body. Leaves with an earthy gritty bitter. Solid.,4.28

Slightly sweet fruit flavor up front balanced by a hoppy bitter finish. I get a lot of pear and citrus with a bit of banana clove spice. Pine hop finish.
I enjoyed this beer but probably won’t revisit.",3.71

Taste is as advertised, sharp fruity flavors, with that Belgian banana/clove background. There is some hoppyness in there too, but the fruit flavors dominate. Feel is also as advertised, sharp and drying. Overall, you get what is advertised, but it's not my favorite, but it is interesting.",3.84
Raging Bitch,"355 ml bottle, from Voldby Købmandsgård, Denmark. ABV is 8.3%, IBU 60. Clear orange colour, big off-white head. Lovely strong aroma of fruity and piney American hops, notes of oranges and slightly caramellized orange marmalade. The flavour is a hoppy explosion from start to finish, fruity (orange marmalade) first, very bitter in the end. There is a considerable malty sweetness that stands up to the bitterness. I don’t get many ""Belgian"" notes out of this ""Belgian IPA"", it is all very American to me.",3.81
Raging Bitch,"12oz bottle. Best by date is stamped on label as '05:23:21'.
Mostly clear, medium amber colored body. One thin finger of white head recedes to thin cap. Leaves some partial lacing walls away from the drinking side.
Aroma of Belgian yeast, with hint of toasted malt and piney hops.
Taste is up front with piney hops, with a good malt base and an expression of the Belgian yeast. Also has some sweeter tropical fruit hops that emerge late. Aftertaste goes to a sweet mellow place with a blend of the main components. Both the initial flavor push and the end game are tasty, although with different emphasis and balance.
Medium mouth feel, with a bit of syrup. Very good carbonation. There is some piney bitterness but not to a burn or stinging experience.
All components get to present and together they work well in a blend and balance. Flavorful IPA, and more distinct because of the yeast smell and taste. Wild side art work on the label.",3.96
Raging Bitch,"Clear copper caramel color with a fluffy white head and nice lacing.

Belgian yeast on the nose with a bit of spice and malt in the background. Maybe a hint of dank hop but its light if its there at all.

Luckily the hoppiness is there in the taste. Dank, piney hops up front with the malty Belgian spice flavors coming through in the finish. At times the flavors almost seem to be competing, but really I think they mostly balance out pretty well. The booziness is well hidden.

Mouthfeel is light and easy to sip with nice, zippy carbonation.

This is pretty nice for something different. Turns out that Belgian flavors and west-coast hop flavors marry pretty well. It's just starting to feel like Spring here and I'd say that's the right time to drink one of these. You don't necessarily want all the tropical hop flavors of a NEIPA, so the roasty malt flavors in this one work nicely when there's still a hint of chill in the air.",4.07
Miller High Life,"Took a 18 pack on vacation. Pleasantly surprised. Poured into pint glass. Smooth crisp taste. Lacing on the glass.
Brings me back to a time of easy drinking and stress free times. Price doesn't hurt either",3.87
Miller High Life,"Every six months I purchase a 40 oz. bottle of this beer hoping that maybe my taste buds were having a ""bad day"" the last time I drank it. I really want to like the High Life but just can't get past the greasy vegetable oil aftertaste finish this beer gives. Maybe its the Galena hops that they use. I tried to find other beers that use these hops but have had no such luck. Molson Coors has retired very drinkable & palate pleasing lagers such as Extra Gold & even Milwaukee's Best Premium. Hamm's and Banquet are the two most enjoyable AAL's that this brewery brews. Not being a ""hater"" I will buy and drink a 40 of MLH in hopes I will see and taste
something different.",2.39
Miller High Life,"Acquired as part of a trade/proxy with @turkeysdrinkbeer in August 2022.

As with all Miller beers, this one looks gorgeous in the glass. It's a crystal clear yellow with a bright white head and bubbles racing up the middle of the glass. It leaves nice lacing on the way down. This is how my old man's beers looked when I was growing up in the 80s. But as with my old man's beers, once you go from eye to mouth, things start going downhill.

On the nose, there's a corny sweetness. It's not appealing in an age of tropical fruit bombs or rich, roasty stouts. There's no hop presence and in fact very little aroma at all. This won't scare off the beer's intended audience, though.

Taste is a letdown even after the nose. There's a minerally, soda water vibe going on. There's some sweet malt, but it's like the beer is produced with postmix and even then the beer syrup in the packet is on its last legs. There is utterly no hop body. The beer has some bitterness, so there are clearly hops in the beer, but maybe they were only waved in the general direction of the boil, rather than actually inserted.

Feel is ok. The carbonation comes through more strongly than I would have expected and it definitely overshadows what taste there is, so the sensation on the swallow again brings to mind carbonated postmix. I've seen a few reviews that point to the beer's excellent softness and generous mouthfeel, but I just don't get it.

I specifically requested some American macros in the trade/proxy that this beer came in, and I'm glad I did, and I will again. Even living in Australia I'm aware of the iconic nature of this beer and its tagline. I'm also aware that it no longer lives up to what a craft beer drinker wants in a beer, but then nor is it meant to. There's an audience for this beer, and it's not a craft beer drinker, but it is a craft beer collector who wants to experience the full gamut of the world's beers, and I'm very much in that camp. It's near impossible to get it through normal channels and I'm glad I went to the effort to get this one. I've loved receiving, pouring and drinking this beer, even though as far as beer goes, it's pretty ordinary. It'll get marked up a little in the overall mark because ultimately it's my overall experience I'm rating here, and in those terms it didn't disappoint at all.

Cheers!",2.29
Miller High Life,"Poured into a beer mug and it was a really clear light golden color with a thick white head. Could not really smell much of anything in the glass. Decent taste and a good thirst quencher, especially on a day after working in the yard or around the house.",2.52
Miller High Life,Looks good smell is not offensive but sweet. Taste has a strong malt sweetness . Very distance hop flavor like all the way at the end of the street. Mouth feel is extremely smooth. I have drank like 200ish bottles in order to make the review and it is a great beer for the price been buying it for 12 pack bottles for $6.50,3.92
Miller High Life,"Poured from a 7oz pony bottle into a rocks glass.

On the pour not a lot of head forms because there is so little liquid and I was a bit too gentle. Over a couple minute the head actually grows from the streams of carbonation rocking up the sides of the glass. Body is a light golden color just a touch darker than straw, leaves light lacing. Good looking beer.

Aroma is grainy with some skunked hops present. This is likely less present in the canned version, but the clear bottles will definitely be skunky. The skunk isn't overwhelming but present and verging on bad. The maltiness of this beer isn't completely covered however. Some corny vibes but it doesn't smell watered down.

Flavor follows the aroma and loses a bit of the skunk amd trades it for a sweet grainy crisp flavor. Some cheapness does come through but miller makes some pretty good cheap beer. The flavor profile is pretty soft and bready with some very very light notes of the hops on the very back end, however they do still provide some bitterness.

Feel is where miller shines the brightest. On the sip isn't feels big while still being refreshing and not too heavy in the stomach. Big carbonation on this one, but it's fine carbonation giving this one decent body.

Overall I think miller makes one of the best American mass market lagers out there, and so far they haven't let me down. Sweet without being too syrupy and bringing the malt flavor that not hoppy beer should have. Refreshing and not too many off flavors like some AALs.",3.28
Miller High Life,Most all domestic beer seems to be a disappointment nowadays..Most beer drinkers think that it used to be of much better quality. Miller High Life was at one time regarded as a quality beer then became a cheap trash beer of the 80ies and 90ies. Few years back they improved it with newer type shelf stable yeasts and the quality has actually came back and it's not too bad compared to the other domestic beers out there. With that said I still miss the quality that all domestic U S beer used to have and now lacks.The big breweries think beer drinkers are uneducated slobs and will drink anything because they can't tell the difference.,2.75
Miller High Life,"Embarking on an Adjunct Adventure lately, seeing if I can find a commercial macro that competes with or bests PBR for my taste buds.

I'll sort this all out and revisit my reviews/ratings after my quest completes.",4.26
Smoked Porter,"Pours a dark brown with some red highlights, a thin tan head and no lacing. Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, a bit of smoke and some nuttiness.

Smoked Porter,"From notes 4/2/12: Pours dark brown with a ruby highlight when held to the light. The pour produces a frothy, tan, short-lived head that receded to nothing and left no lacing.

Taste is the same with heavier dark malt notes and a nice nuttiness with minor hop hints in the finish and a lingering bitter aftertaste. The level of smoke is a little disappointing. The taste is well balanced. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy bodied with nice carbonation, smooth and very drinkable.",3.92
Smoked Porter,"Not as smoke forward as I like but still an undeniably good beer. It's a bit more on the traditional porter side, with a nice hop bite, caramel sweetness and deep roasted nut aroma.

Smoked Porter,"It pours a deep dark black yielding a spectacular one inch white foamy head leaving some nice lumpy valleys in the head. The head dies within a minute.

The taste is dry, roasty, bitter and sweet at different times throughout the beer. Some burnt malts seem to come through a bit as the beer warms.

The Mad Elf,"Procured via a proxy/trade hybrid with @turkeysdrinkbeer in February 2022 and drunk in September 2022.

The beer is a deep copper colour in the glass with ruby highlights. The head is off-white and quickly reduces to a thin covering. There's lacing on the glass. Minimal, lazy, small-bubbled carbonation is evident.

The nose is complex. There's cherry (verging on that Dr.Pepper artificial cherry aroma), marzipan, sweet caramel malt, maybe some vanilla and cloves and a bit of cinnamon in there. Overlaying it all is a hint of alcohol. To me, it's not all that enticing and comes across as a little harsh in the cherry stakes.

The taste largely follows the nose but the cherry and sweet caramelly malt combine well together in the mouth. The cherry is quite forward, but not as harsh as it was in the nose. I don't pick up any honey but there are what I perceive as Christmas spices in the middle of the swallow At the end, there's a sweet, prolonged tanginess present that demands a further sip. Put together it all tastes really nice.

The mouthfeel is sharp, and appropriate. There's minimal carbonic prickling after the swallow but a nice alcoholic warmth settles in the stomach. I felt some numbness in my mouth while drinking this, and while that could be totally random, it was definitely there. I'm ignoring that for the sake of scoring.

Overall I would definitely go back for another one of these, notwithstanding the 11% ABV and the somewhat harsh notes in the aroma. I'm drinking this on a cold, windy day at the start of Spring and it suits the weather perfectly. Christmas Ales aren't really a thing in Australia, as Christmas can be scorching down here, and while I don't subscribe to the idea that you can't drink heavy dark beers in summer there's no denying that this would be great in the middle of winter accompanied by a fire and great company.

Cheers!",3.93
The Mad Elf,"Handsome looking pour . Clear deep red body under a large tan head that left good lacing. Aroma delivers the promised cherries in a non subtle way, along with a good dose of honey and seasonal spices. Flavor takes off in a couple different directions. The yeasty underpinning, the pronounced fruit footprint from the cherries, the added dimension that the spices, particularly the cinnamon, provide and the soft sweetness from the honey all working together. This sampling is from the 2021 production run with a best by date of 11/2022",4.37

Nose has hints of cherries over a very large malt base.

Taste is a large malt base infused with cherries. Hopping tries to balance things out but does not quite get there. Finishes with a touch of cinnamon and a nice warmth with each sip.

Mouthfeel is medium to large bodied and smooth.

The Mad Elf,"Read the description involving cherries, vanilla, cinnamon, etc. and heard that Troegs cut down on their supply this year due to low cherry supply- therefore I expected it to be very sweet and cherry forward. However, it comes off a typical belgian tripel. Very good, would prefer it over anything you could find in the grocery store.",4.01
The Mad Elf,"Looks really good in a pint glass with it's reddish brown hue. I am not so good with sense of smell, but the taste is very good, I get the flavor of the cherries, could not really get too much honey flavor.

The one time I was actually at Hershey park, near the Troeg's brewery, but I was not able to visit the brewery. At least their fine products are available near me!",4.31

The Mad Elf,"I thought this would be too heavy and sweet, or have too many odd flavors, but it does not. It just tastes good and it goes down easy. It’s been a few months so I’ll have to update next year on the taste. All I know is I miss it.",5.0
The Mad Elf,"Found this at my local supermarket with a buddy of mine whilst we were studying for some finals in college. Neither of us had heard of this beer, so we thought we'd give it a try with zero expectations. They were room temperature, which was (only was) a bit concerning.

We crack open our first bottle and boy was it pure magic. Both of us agreed right then and there that this was one of the best beers either of us had tasted. Perhaps the stress of the exams with being on an empty stomach stirred up the right conditions to love this beer on that night, but my feelings towards it haven't changed.

Awesome beer, expect something very sweet and QUITE boozy",4.39

Nut Brown Ale,Wow! What a beer this ridiculously smooth brown ale has you wanting more. Pours a brown perfect color with mild carbonation. Smells of mild malt with nutty aromas. An oldy but a goody!,4.24
Nut Brown Ale,"A staple back in the late 80's when so few good beers could be found.
Bright, light brown color and crystal clear supporting a thin barely off-white head that slumps quickly.
Aroma is mild malt with hints of chocolate and brown sugar but you have to go looking for them.
The flavors, at least in retrospect, are solid dark mild / brown ale flavors. Mild and slightly sweet, the complexity of the earthy hops and caramelized grain stand up despite the thin body and mouth feel
Traditional flavors as far as this US drinker can tell though not the depth of character it's label and mystique suggests.",3.94
Nut Brown Ale,"Pours a clear tawny brown, .75"" light tan head, minimal lacing. Nose is moderate malt, hard water, light caramel.

Very drinkable and happily readily available.",4.16

Nut Brown Ale,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to rest 15-20 min, before pouring into a round-bottomed stein

Look: Tea-colored, translucent brown, with gold highlights, and a 3-finger tan head

Smell: Bready yeast, sweet malts, and caramel

Taste: dried fruits, caramelized sugar, malts, with a dry, nutty finish

Mouthfeel: Medium overall - light, with strong effervescence. Slight residue left on the tongue. Not chewy or boozy.

Overall: A very well-balanced, malt-forward brown ale. I appreciate how it's not over sweet, and that the bitterness comes across more as a dry finish instead of twisting ones tongue in knots. I can definitely see why it's well-regarded.",4.3

F - Medium body, with medium carbonation. Refreshing, and very drinkable.
O - I've had this ale before, but only now am I actually reviewing it. A fantastic brown ale. Covers all the bases, and the nuttiness was something I've been craving for a couple of months now. Definitely recommend this one, and I'll be buying it again real soon.",4.37
Nut Brown Ale,"I got a bottle of this beer from the Woodman's in Onalaska, Wisconsin just outside of La Crosse. It poured a clear rich amber with khaki head that is not leaving much lace.

Nut Brown Ale,"Poured from ab12oz bottle.
L- Dark brow but you can still se thought it held up to the light. Tan head of frothy bubbles, but not too fine. About 1 finger an dissapates into a ring and a few bubble islands.

S- coffee notes with a dark sweetness and bitter hop notes that balance the malts. Almost herbal funky earthy qualities from the yeast

T- taste follows the smell but is more mellow and creamy. Then it transforms into a roasty slightly bittered aftertaste, the malt and hops work together in this one very well, hops are very traditional.

F- this one is definitely a before bed/winter warmer, very thick and hearty. Good with a big warm traditional steak and potato dinner or maybe a lasagna, comfort foods things like that. Has a nice nostalgic vibe.

O- good to have a couple but not the most seasonable in the world compared to other British styles, but the flavor is very good and the quality shows. A very nice sipper.",4.23
Nut Brown Ale,"Earthy, bold, highly flavorful, and unique. Tastes like I imagine beer would have tasted when knights in armor stomped this planet. There is an antiquity to the character of this beer, and it is not branding, it is real. A very large range of flavors, from slightly tart to sweet to coffee, cocoa powder, mineral, woodsy, smoky... and something indiscernible to my current vocabulary but extremely good. Creamy, silky feel. Lingering wonderful flavors. One of the best ever no doubt.",4.62
Nut Brown Ale,"I poured the beer into an imperial pint nonic, a decent pour produces a nice fluffy off white brownish head, it sticks around for a bit and recedes to a thin cap that leaves a little lace with each sip. The color is medium dark brown and is somewhat translucent. The smell is all malt with a little roastyness, nothing grassy or herbal about it. The taste follows the nose, it's not sweet, but not bitter. I find the taste to be lacking in that ashy roasted barley that I find in other brown ales that I like. The feel is straight up medium body with maybe a little more carbonation than I care for, but seems right for the style. Overall, I like it and would revisit, but I have had better examples of the style.",3.67
Nut Brown Ale,"No obvious date. Only marking I see is SA30T1, on the neck of the bottle.
I've had this several times previous, just never reviewed it, somehow.

Clear chestnut brown, with slight redddish tint if held up to the light. Light tan head, that leaves a thin ring.

Smell is light raisin+date, followed by a nutty (walnut?) aroma after the head fades. Slight, fresh, biscuity malt aroma appears when swirled.

Taste is roasted nuts (walnut+pecan), brown bread, raisin, some hop spiciness, and a vague woody/earthy flavor.

Feel is medium light, initially smooth , with light very,very fine, sharp carbonation bite coming in later. Suspect that this is fairly fresh, or that previous specimens were quite old, as I don't remember it being that sharp. (& I like it better now)

Overall, smooth, easy-drinking, and always a pleasure. Nice to revisit the old standards every now & again.",4.15
Nut Brown Ale,"Review 1636
Nut Brown
Samuel Smith
Date: unknown
I have consumed this beer several times; it surprised me to learn I have not reviewed it. The beer was 44 degrees, and I poured it into a pint glass. The pour created a frothy and creamy two-fingered head, a light tan head with good retention. The somewhat slow dissipation left a bit of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 15, mahogany color with ruby hues. When put to a light source, the beer has clarity.

The aromas in the beer are nutty, caramel, toffee, medium roasted malts, a touch of herbal, hint of floral, and malty sweetness.

I taste nuttiness, caramel, toffee, roasted malts, bready, earthiness, a hint of floral, cereal grains, a touch of mineral, and malty sweetness.

The mouthfeel is creamy.

The body is medium, medium-low carbonation, and subtle finish.

A classic nut brown ale with all the goodness to make you go back for more. I enjoy this beer and what this brewery produces. Cheers!",4.13
Nut Brown Ale,"From a 22 oz bottle bought with a three bottle gift pack. Enjoyed on the side porch while watching the chicks experience their first real grass! 9/19/21 Lovely malty, caramely aroma. Great mouthfeel and the taste is caramel, roast, and stone. I'm not a huge fan of this type, but this was fantastic!",4.15
Nut Brown Ale,"Lovely orangey brown colour. Thick, brown-tinged, off-white head that dissipates quickly but leaves thick bands of lacing. Toasty malts on the nose, hint of chocolate, caramel, and red wine. The taste is quite chocolatey, more chocolatey than nutty I think. The mouthfeel is rounded, refreshing, and not too sweet, very well balanced by the slight bitterness of the roasted malts and the gentle hint of earthy hops. Overall a solid English brown ale.",4.03
Obsidian Stout,"I don’t know why it has taken me this many years to try this beer. It’s really darn good. Very much an American Stout with the piney PNW hopping and bitterness levels. SRM, head color and solid retention is practically perfect.",4.34
Obsidian Stout,"Poured from a 12oz bottle.

On the pour a nice head forms my pour was pretty gentle so it wasn't huge, but it was made up of fine light brown bubbles. It fades to a decent ring with some on top. It's pitch black with no light coming through.

Smell is mostly roast with strong note of dark chocolate on top of a nice dark bread base with some earthy piney hops in the mix as well. It's a very pleasant aroma a bit heavy with some lightly fruity fermentation notes.

Taste follows the nose, but with a big bitter hop bite on the front with the roast malts shining through right after. The hop bitterness lingers as the flavor evolves from the hop flavor to the malt roastiness. The fruity fermentation stick around a bit. In the stout it's like raisins or vague dark cherries but it isn't pronounced. Quite nice and very nuanced.

Feel is quite heavy. One of those liquid bread beers and quite thick in the mouth as more head forms. Despite that it's easy to put down and quite smooth. Goes with a meaty meal or just a nice cold night with a good show.

Overall despite being a standard stout at just above 6% it's got a big flavor without adjuncts. Very good what they did with hops water and malt here. Good job.",4.06

Obsidian Stout,"look: 92% black

Obsidian Stout,"Black body with creamy brown head. Completely full body, impossible to see through. So nice looking. Aroma is of coffee and medium dark chocolate, some dark fruits as well along with a dash of earthy hops. Taste is superb, with rich chocolate textures and an espresso bitterness. The earthy hops provide a a nice dry balance. Mouthfeel is slightly milky with a mild chalky feel. This is a terrific example of a stout.",4.38
Obsidian Stout,"I have enjoyed this brew many times before, but never reviewed. Now is the time. A new hop to me, Delta. The malt profile promises rich creamy and sweet.
An impressive mousse caramel head with microbubbles forms straightaway. Appears nitro but is not. The liquid is black black as expected. Not super thick but enough for 6+ abv. Carbonation only seen when shaken.
Nose: Cocao, chocolate chip cookie, deep roasted coffee notes lingering. Dark and indulgent. Hop presences with malt. Cream. Comperable in smell to Old Rasputin.
The espresso notes are certainly there. It leaves the same aftertaste as biting a coffee bean. Excellent for those who enjoy. Pleasantly lighter than I expexted with a slight bite to balance the malt. There is residual booziness but when combined with the bitter espresso it works well.
A sharp stout.

As a coffee lover this works for me. If you dislike, avoid Obsidian. The mouthfeel is lacking in fullness and action, but is made up for in taste and smell. For Deschutes, I think their Porter is a better option (but not fair, as it is one of the best.)",4.08
Obsidian Stout,"12 ounce bottle into a snifter. Bottled 2/24/21, had 6/20/21.

Flavors of chocolate, herbal hops, roasted malt, vanilla, a bit of a smoky flavor, a little hop bitterness on the finish. Smooth, a very good medium to full body, well carbonated.

A good, solid stout, roasty and smoky. Very enjoyable.",4.01
Obsidian Stout,"pours an almost jet black with dark tan head that lingers a decently long time. Leaves a thin rim of lace at the original liquid level. Smell= taste: some bitterness, some dark chocolate, some roasted malts. Nice for something not barrel-aged. Mouthfeel is a bit on the thinnish side for my preferred stout experience. Cost effective, IMO, compared to some of the better, but pricier, stouts. I would drink this again.",4.23
Obsidian Stout,"This is a 12oz. bottle dated 11/19/20 poured aggressively into a 20oz. weizen glass. There is a perfect three finger tan head over a very dark cola stout. This stout is way to dark to observe carbonation, After ten minutes the foam settled back to a thin layer with thick lacing left behind.
The aroma is sweet chocolate up front with light coffee in the background.
The flavor is just the opposite, with chocolate up front, but the taste is dominated by the dry, bitter coffee flavors. There is not a noticeable alcohol burn for me. The coffee flavors cut the sweetness very nicely.
There is a silky smooth feel, but not overly heavy. The carbonation feels light.
For me this stout was very enjoyable, but be ready for bitter coffee flavors.",4.1
Obsidian Stout,"Obsidian is an apt description: dark, opaque, a persistent cappuccino froth for a head. Then I start to get disappointed. The scent is slightly over-hopped citrus and coffee, and the taste only enhances the citrus.... and keeps enhancing it as I drink. Over-carbonated going down, this is not the stout I was looking for.",2.68
Palate Wrecker,"Shared 12 fl. oz. bottle, kindly provided by abemorsten. ABV is 9.5%. Hazy orange colour, large white head. Strong aroma of orange marmalade and fruity and resinous American hops. The flavour is indeed a ""palate wrecker"" - that is why this beer was chosen as the last beer of the evening at our tasting. Extremely hoppy flavour, but still, in its own weird way, fairly ""well balanced"" - mainly because the malty sweetness seems just right. to stand up to the hoppiness. Grapefruit, resin / pine and spruce. Yes, it is a ""typically American double IPA"", and I’ve ""seen it before""- but still: Oh so GOOD! Halleluja!",3.94
Palate Wrecker,"From old, undated notes. Poured from the bottle.

Palate Wrecker,"From notes 3/9/13: Pours clear golden amber producing 2 fingers of frothy, variously bubbled, moderately lasting, off-white head that leaves streaks and webs of lace. Aroma is sweet caramel malt with vanilla, resinous pine, grapefruit and other citrus with a hint of pineapple. Taste is hop forward resinous pine, grapefruit, lemon and orange pith and zest, backed by caramel malt sweetness with pineapple and spice (alcohol?) in a bitter finish. There is a tea-like herbal bitterness throughout. Starts bittersweet and finishes super bitter and dry. Aftertaste is resinous, oily hop bitter with some malt sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, creamy, drying, oily and drawing.",4.19
Palate Wrecker,"Pleasantly surprised, as it is not as intense as I thought after reading the description. Hoppy for sure, but relatively smooth and slick. Some malt comes through the hop assault as well, making this a tasty beer. Cheers!",4.26
Palate Wrecker,"From the 12 oz. bottle. Pours clear copper/gold color. Hop forward, boozy smell with hints of orange and pine. Malty bitter taste with hints of honey, grapefruit and pine. Bitter to the end. Pretty good but not my fave.",3.96
Palate Wrecker,"12 oz bottle - not really fresh (best by Aug 2017 - now November 2017) so I would like to try fresh b ut.... despite not fresh kept refrigerated and this was fantastic. Pours a slightly hazy orange amber with 1-2 finger head. Caramel malt with citrus/tropical fruit aroma. Taste is sweet citrus, pineapple with distinct pine flavour followed by a dank sticky bitterness coating the mouth. Bites you and then begs you to have more. Appropriately boozy. Great!

Repeat visit as showed up in Edmonton July 2019 .... still great!",4.31
Palate Wrecker,"So if you only Love in a beer is hops you can't really do too much better here cause this stops just short of a hop smoothie. I myself am a hops hunter so this is great. The look is about a 9 or 10 in srm in a clear glass in natural sunlight it is a 7. That's a little light since most DIPA is at least a 10. The smell is sweet and piny, nice and smooth with a nice thick forestry sting. The taste is pure hops. You can definitely feel the alcohol but you technically can't tast it cause of the power of the hops. The feel is heavy like a stout with a nice finish that reminds you of a morning coffee. Overall this is a Heavy DIPA that might be able to just get away within the fabled Triple IPA class. It begins and ends with the word Hops",4.53
Kellerweis,"I think their label got it right on the nose ""Our Bavarian-style wheat beer is complex with flavors reminiscent of banana bread and spicy clove.

Very much so enjoy the banana bread flavor going on, as well as the very smooth finish.",3.87
Kellerweis,"Rerate, 355 ml bottle, Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. I turned the bottle upside down before opening. Hazy yellow colour, small white head of poor retention.

The flavour is also citrussy, with moderate notes of banana and cloves. Fizzy mouthfeel.

Original rating: 355 ml bottle, at Peter Gift, Aarhus, Denmark. Deep golden colour, no head at all in the shiny glass, probably due to the pub’s ignorant use of rinse aid / rinse agent.

Shock Top Belgian White,"Very drinkable, quaffable beer. Nice head, deep amber/pale orange color. No note of hops nose on it. Smell is orangey. First drink was surprising - in that I was expecting a belgian yeast, but it wasn't there. Also lacking was the coriander - though it has a prominent orange juice taste. Goes down easy, clean, not much of an after taste. No discernable hop bitterness or hop citrus hit. I was missing the belgian yeast taste and at least a bit of hops nose to it. Frankly, it tastes like a generic clean ale with some orange juice added.

Certainly a good lawnmower beer, but nothing special and really an outlier of a belgian wheat.",2.54

Clearish yellow with a head that lasts. Smells like orange pine-sol, not terrible but sorta chem-y. I like the taste of this, but can't have more than one at a time. Has a harsh grain alcohol element, otherwise it's easy drinking

OK for girl beer ;)",2.72
Shock Top Belgian White,"Orangeish liquid. Drank from bottle

Shock Top Belgian White,"Appearance: Pours a slightly hazy (~35% opacity), medium golden color with a medium white head. Bubbling and aggressive. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Mild aromas. Some faint pale malts, grains, and hints of citrus. Not much here. (3.00)

Flavor: Flavor is mild too. It has mild pale malts upfront before a sour and grassy note in the middle, before some faint lemon citrus notes. Has a sour and leafy note that lingers. Only mildly sweet. Minimal yeast too. (3.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied, lower carbonation. Finishes with a slight sour note on the finish. (3.25)

Compared to Stone Dayfall 6/13/21: Pours an identical color. Milder aromas/flavors. More sour lemongrass, Less orange, orange peel, bergamot flower, and jasmine. Winner: Dayfall

to Blue Moon LightSky 7/12/21: Pours a darker color. Milder aromas/flavors. More pale/adjunct malts with a larger body. Less juicy orange.

Overall: A pretty bland beer here. Even a disappointment for knowing what I was walking into. The appearance was the best part. Minimal aromas and flavors altogether. A mild sour note is really all I detect that lingers. People on here have described this as similar to Blue Moon, but I would think that Blue Moon would drink far superior. This was bland, sour, and flavorless. (Final Rating: 3.24)",3.24
Shock Top Belgian White,"Average to slightly underwhelming. Its hard to not come off a giant beer douche while writing this, but it’s the truth. Shock Top on a summer day is delightful, but after a few sips it just becomes rather meh.

But, if you’re beer needs Newman’s help to be considered good, you don’t have a very good beer.

Daisy Cutter,"Finally got my hands on one of these as I found this classic brew at a Total Wine in Tempe, Arizona when I was out there not too long ago. Like Sierra Nevada's flagship brew, this deserved to be rated high on here although it wasn't quite the gold standard that it's California counterpart has become.

This had a nice, copper hue to it was it was bright and topped off with plenty of offsetting head as the lacing left behind was somewhat extensive, but wavy and scattered without any hints of rings among the suds. Lots of bread, pine, and orange in the nose with some metallic hops underneath that, as the balance really shone through in the taste. Part fruit, part malt, and part bitter, this was nicely balanced, nicely carbonated, and easily enjoyable with some Caramel Malt, bread, and biscuit to keep the balance in check. as the earthiness became more apparent once this fully warmed up.

Not a lot of bitterness or burn to be had here, as the amount of alcohol was spot-on. Dated 3/3 on the bottom of the can with ""RECKONING"" written below it, there was a ton of pine and bitterness with some acrid lemon and enduring earthiness that left me wanting more. No doubt that this deserves it rating and classic status on here as I'd easily reach for it again, and a chaser of cold water afterwards!",4.19
Daisy Cutter,"Poured from a can into a pint glass. Pours orange yellow with a fluffy white head. Smells of floral and citrus hops. Tastes of grassy hops with hints or floral and citrus. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",4.24
Daisy Cutter,"Good orange gold color with light khaki head, 80% transparent.

Nose teased a bit of caramel and produce dept.

Taste was hop led bitterness and a rather restrained malt leading to a watery result for me

Mid bodied but the taste tilted it toward the leaner side.

I was expecting a bit more malt but perhaps I need more experience with the pale ale. All of my tasting scores of pale ales have been lower than IPAs for example.",3.53
Daisy Cutter,"Serving: 1 pint 3.2 fl. oz can (“01/19/22B… Rocky Top”) poured into a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Slightly hazy, deep gold approaching amber. Pours with an amazing rocky head of white foam that persists and leaves sticky lace along the glass.

Smell: Orange and lemon citrus, pine needles and biscuits.

Taste: Crisply dry and balanced, with plenty of citrus, piney and resinous hops along with nice biscuit and caramel malt body.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, slight oily feel, and moderate carbonation.

Overall: Timeless balance of hops and malt, fantastic West Coast APA.",4.11
Daisy Cutter,"This beer pours a dark golden color, almost amber. Quite clear looking. The head is 2 finger, white, frothy, and fluffy looking. The head retention is quite good, and the head clings to the glass to form nice lacing as it dissipates.
Nose is quite minimal. I do get a faint hint of hops that makes me think of pine.
Up front I get a nice malty biscuit flavor, slightly buttery. This biscuit doesn't last long, because the hops then kick in. They're not as strong as an IPA (of course), but they're there, and linger. The hops tend toward pine. There's also a slight earthy, grassy flavor here also.
Body is crisp, but also full at the same time.
Overall this is a quite delicious beer, and I'm glad we've got it locally now.",4.01
Daisy Cutter,"Look - Great looking clear slightly lighter copper color with a white head and sticky lacing
Smell - citrus, floral, slight pine with a caramel malt backbone. Very classic Pale
Taste - citrus, floral, pine and caramel malt backbone just like the smell. slightly bitter but not overly bitter like some classic pales can be
Feel - Medium body with a medium light carb
Overall - pretty standard classic pale",3.84
Daisy Cutter,"Clean, easy drinking pale ale, almost like a dry hopped lager, very crisp flavor with excellent carbonation, hop profile with just a touch of juice, fruit (apple, lemon), herbs and spice (mint, pepper, pine). Refreshing, on the lighter side for IPA fans - as it should be. An extremely well done ale.",4.35
Daisy Cutter,"A dark gold color with a thick off-white head and plenty of lace
Aroma of citrus fruit, floral hops, and a hint of pine
Taste of grapefruit, caramel, and late pine
Medium-bodied, lingering bitterness.",4.04
Daisy Cutter,"Pours a slightly hazy golden color with a big fluffy off-white head that settles into a solid cap.

The aroma is of citrus and tropical hop notes. Orange and pineapple with a bit of spice in the end.

The taste has more bitter hop notes. I get some orange with a noticeable piney bite. Light pineapple provides some brightness. Sweet bready malt. Good balance.

Solid mouthfeel with semi-soft carbonation. Starts sweet from the malt but quickly transitions to the piney bitterness.

A fine APA. Plenty of hops flavors for the style though the hop profile didn't wow me.",3.93
Special Double Cream Stout,"12 oz bottle
Glass: Nonic Pint
Temp at Pour: 47 F
ABV: 6.1%


Look:
Very dark brown-to-black with some chestnut highlights when held up to a light. 1-finger dark tan/light brown head that quickly dissipates to a thing cover and then that begins to disappear. I suspect that the age of this bottle is a factor, here.

Smell:
Sweet roasted oats and rich semi-sweet chocolate. Touch of coffee here and there.

Taste:
Initial molasses sweetness is quickly joined by roasted oats and some char. The semi-sweet chocolate appears and transitions to bittersweet chocolate and obvious coffee notes emerge. Anise shows up near the end. Finishes on a sweet fading chocolate and molasses note.

Feel:
Smooth and creamy. Body is in the heavier side of medium

Overall:
This stout is a perennial favorite of mine. I pick up at least a 6 pack each year, if I can. The coffee and chocolate notes remind of coffee stouts, but are much less in your face. The heavier body is nice. Somehow, this particular bottle hid in the cellar for 2 years. It didn't last long after I found it.",3.87
Special Double Cream Stout,"L - black with mahogany highlights and a creamy tan head that dissipates somewhat quickly leaving behind some lacing
S - notes of semi sweet chocolate, roasted dark malts, coffee - smell is somewhat faint
T - follows the nose with semi sweet chocolate and roasted dark malts intermixed with sweet cream and coffee along with a somewhat nutty finish
F - medium bodied with light to medium carbonation. Smooth and velvety, but a little thin on the finish
O - a nice milk stout that doesn't really do anything wrong.",4.29
Special Double Cream Stout,"Poured gently from a bottle into a snifter glass, forming maybe a finger of tan head. Deep cola brown color. Smell is sweet/roasty oats. Taste is similar to the taste, just mostly roasty with some sweetness. Taste got a bit much after it warmed, wasn't a fan at all at that point. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. A fine milk stout if you like the roasty nature.",3.62
Special Double Cream Stout,"It's a very good, strong and sweet stout, with the heavier body and roasty characteristics you'd expect from a stout, magnified with the extra maltiness and higher abv of a double stout. The hop, malt, roast and sweet flavors are well balanced, and overall, it's just all around an excellent beer.

On the newer brown label, the words ""Double Cream"" are larger than the rest of the name, so the two of us read that as ""doubly sweet stout"" rather than ""sweet double stout"", which is what it actually is - a maltier, stronger version of a sweet stout. It's still a cream stout so of course it is sweet, but it's not dessert levels of sweetness, which is good, in my opinion.

In other words, a Cream Stout is a sweet stout, and a Double Stout is a stronger, maltier stout, so this Double Cream Stout is both of those put together. It makes sense in hindsight :)

I've liked pretty much every beer I've tried from Bell's, although they're the most expensive 6-packs you can buy (around here at least). When other craft beers were $10 for a 6-pack, Bell's 6-packs were $17, so I normally never buy them.",5.0
Special Double Cream Stout,"Appearance: Pours a dark, nearly jet black color with a large and massive tan head that slowly elopes into the stout in liquid form. An ever transformation of head into beer that is a beautiful show. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate to strong aromas of smooth coffee roast, creamed coffee, and chocolate milk. Mostly smooth coffee roast and creamed coffee. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of smooth milk chocolate, sweet cream, and creamed coffee. A soft body with a smooth finish. Some smoke off the end. (4.00)

Feel: Medium bodied. Soft, and smooth. Moderate carbonation. (4.00)

Compared to Bells Porter: Pours a similar color with a darker and larger head. Stronger aromas. More creamed coffee and cream. Less roasted black malt and roast.

Compared to Founders' Porter 1/25/22: Pours a similar color with a slightly lighter colored head. Similar aromas. More smooth chocolate and cream. Slightly less airy coffee roast. Overall, similar.

Overall: This is a pretty good sweet cream stout. It pours an gorgeous appearance. The flavors are primarily focused around creamed coffee and that's what this beer reminds me of. I'm not a milk or cream stout person, but this one might change my mind and could grow on me. (Final Rating: 4.02)",4.02
Special Double Cream Stout,"Pours black with a finger of off white head reducing to a thick cap; decent lacing. Nose is bitter coffee, herbal and earthy hops, and bakers chocolate. Taste follows suit. Fairly bitter, earthy, not much sweetness or cream. Mouthfeel is thin and watery which is to be expected of the ABV I suppose. Okay beer. Won’t seek it out further.",3.41
Special Double Cream Stout,"12oz bottle served in a nonic glass. Packaged 09/24/2021. PRN 34794.

Appearance: Very dark brown, with some ruby red highlights at the edges. Thin tan head with some persistent sheets of lacing noted.

Smell: Sweet, roasted malt with some chocolate (cocoa powder, milk chocolate) notes. With a swirl, some coffee / espresso notes and just a bit of a metallic copper aroma.

Taste: Well blended sweet malt, cream/lactose sugars, roasted malt, coffee-like bitterness, and a little bit of char bitterness with a hint of tobacco as well.

Mouthfeel: Certainly holds up to its name. It's nicely thick and creamy smooth. Light carbonation underneath it all.

Overall / Drinkability: A very good stout, and went well with some chocolate covered pretzels. I think this would pair really well with a burger as a substitute for a milkshake. A bit of a sipping beer and I'm finding one is enough, but I would definitely get again.",4.0
Special Double Cream Stout,"Look: Poured black as strong coffee with a light tan head. Bubble foam lace on the glass.
Smell and Taste: Cocoa and coffee notes. Sweet but no overpowering.
Feel: Smooth going down but slightly watery.
Overall: Could use a little kick in the ass with a higher ABV. Gosh, am I starting to should like an alcoholic? LOL",4.16
Special Double Cream Stout,"Pour is esthetically pleasing, no head with a nice straight pour to the bottom of a tullip glass. A nice lacing surrounds the outermost layer of the glass. Best enjoyed cold, but not ice cold. Aromas of dark chocolate, cocoa, hazelnut, roasted malt, with less of a creamy taste but more of a creamy feel. This is the kind of beer that leaves you feeling warm, that snuggles the inside of your stomach. The earthy-ness brings in autumn vibes, a beer best enjoyed sitting next to a fire that’s fueled with oak wood. Not considerable dry. Overall a great dessert beer.",4.2
Special Double Cream Stout,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. PKG 9/13/2021, so pretty fresh.

L---Darkest brown with orange around the edges. Medium light brown head faded quickly to a ring and left nice lacing.

S---Malty as advertised. Coffee & toasty malts.

T---Follows the nose...coffee and roasted malts.

F---Medium/full bodied. Creamy, as advertised.

O---A really nice one. Would get again.",4.02
Special Double Cream Stout,"Virtually no head when poured on tap. What little foam there is, dissipates quickly. Smells and taste of coffee, slight vanilla, and spice. Bitterness level is just right. Nothing really stands out, pretty mediocre",3.42
Special Double Cream Stout,"From a 12 fl. oz. bottle dated 08/17/2020. Sampled April 4, 2021.

It pours near black with a modest, diminishing tan head.

The aroma has a little chocolate and vanilla with a mild floral hop profile underneath.

Light to medium mouthfeel.

The taste is also creamy and dark but the finish feels clean to me.",3.97
Special Double Cream Stout,"L: Pours black as night in color with a bitchin, tall espresso head.
S: Smells rich of coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, slight amount of coffee.
T: Very much follows the nose, sweet dark fruit flaor.
F: Low carbonation, full-bodied, silky, smooth.
O: Not a bad brew, I'd just like it to be more roasted.",3.88
Special Double Cream Stout,"A: Glistening highlights of Merlot outline a pour that was a rich chocolate color. A milky froth capping of one finger, was tan-hide in color, was short lived. Tiny effervesce bubbles slowly make their way though the darken experience in the vessel with a solid gold lace band encircling above like a halo.

S: Creamy rich and milky chocolate character with some marshmallow highlights on the opening nose. Eloquent milky coffee roast is freshly grounded and straight to the glass. Dark chocolate is sweet along with some burnt caramel and cocoa. There's a bit of smokey sweet dark fruit about, cherries and plums in particular that mixes with some roasted pine and silty charred remains. When all is said and done everything blends beautifully together in a balanced way.

T: The flavor was equally rich and rewarding, sweet vanilla and milky roast is very flavorful, along with some smoky wood highlights. Burnt molasses and caramel creamer add sweetness along with some dark fruit of plums and black cherries. There is some roasted pine hop leaves, milky lactose that blends well with the subtle smoky character and backbone. Wet silty ash hints are smooth as silk.

M: Full bodied experience on the mouthful, very creamy, with a lot of depth. A softly carbonated presence with just the right amount of tingle for a big stout beer. Warm roasted warming on the hold.

O: Overall a perfectly balanced brew, smooth and softly roasted sweet cream stout that is dessert in a glass with an exceptional drinkability. Sweet vanilla, rich coffee roastiness defines this drink, like a smooth Italian coffee. Huge creamy mouthful is the explanation point along with a lingering wet silty bitterness that begs for more sips. Poetry in a glass.",4.26
Special Double Cream Stout,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Pitch black in color, perhaps a faint ruby on the edges. Somewhat sized brown head with good retention and lacing.

Aroma: toasted/roasted grains and malts, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, cream, lactose, burnt caramel, and toffee.

Taste: I'm tasting the toasted/roasted grains and malts especially with some hop bite. Also tasting some more bitter coffee and dark chocolate. Because of this, the sweet notes mentioned in the aroma have more of a minor role, although I can still taste the lactose/milky notes somewhat well. Body is medium-light.",4.1
Special Double Cream Stout,"Serving: On tap at Brasil (Houston, TX) served in a shaker pint glass.

Appearance: Relatively opaque, dark brown with ruddy tones. Pours with a short head of tan foam and leaves a few streaks of lace.

Smell: Toasty roasted grains and hot chocolate.

Taste: Less assertive roasted malt; coffee, chocolate and caramel. Leans a little sweet and boozy but remains restrained.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, creamy smooth feel and softer carbonation.

Overall: A solid and drinkable, malt focussed stout. Went down well alongside morning coffee.",3.99
Special Double Cream Stout,"Pours like a syrupy coca cola. Not as fizzy. Very little head in my teku glass. Still practicing smelling - this one I get cold coffee - making me wonder if it would get better as I let it warm up, has been chilling in my very cold fridge. I'm also getting bitter dark chocolate in the smell. I can't wait to taste. Nice classic stout flavor. Not too bitter, some coffee flavors, as I let it rest on my tongue I get a slight numbing experience, only 6.1% abv though. The mouth feel is not as creamy, not as silky as I remember stouts to be, this one being my first in at least a couple years, but I feel like that makes it a bit more drinkable. I do want some water after, it's like a dessert in that way.",4.12

Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,"12/01/21 It's aged a year and a half since my comment below and it's much more mature in taste. My only characteristic of this beer that is not improved is the mouthfeel. It's a bit on the thin side.

Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,"2011 vintage opened on 1/3/20. Aggressive pour yielded Low carbonation. I poured it back and forth between pint glasses to get it to breathe a bit and roused 0.5 fingers of marshmallowy-thick dark brown head with great retention. Liquid is pitch black. Very good looking. Aroma is molasses and bourbon and cocoa, some vanilla and coffee. Decent aroma. Flavor is remarkably sound after 8-9 years in the cellar and 2 house moves. Only off note is slight cardboard in the aftertaste which knocks the enjoyment down a bit. Strong beer that got a lot mellower in time and is quite enjoyable!",4.06

Black appearance.

A violent pour yielded a nice dark khaki head; decent lace.

Blackberry, bakers chocolate, raspberry & marshmallow notes in the nose; enticing!

Thick, creamy mouthfeel.

Blackberry & cream flavors up front; bakers chocolate notes on the finish. Faint booze heat emerged as this warmed.

The nose was incredible, but the flavor wasn't transcendent. Very good, and just shy of great...",4.17
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,"Two and a half year old 12 oz bottle in a jar glass. Hardly a lick of head. Jet black Body.

Nose has a Molasses-heavy scent. Deeper notes of cinnamon and some leather tones also present more as it warms. Almost black licorice.

Taste is awesome - lots going on. Really like that it is heavy but complex - evolves throughout the pour - sweeter malts pop early and black Malts dance later.

Slick mouthfeel and i think it could stand a bit more bubbles. Maybe a product of it being an aged beer in a bottle.

Really nice - like this beer and think the classic imperial Russian stout malt profile do this beer week.",4.15
Plead The 5th Imperial Stout,"355ml bottle from Brewdog.com (£4.90):
A jet black, opaque beer that's got a very fine, tan brown lacing on top but it quickly fades to a bubbly lacing around the circumference a few seconds later. The nose isn't quite as strong as you'd expect from an 11% beer but opens with dark malts, coffee & an earthy bitterness as well as some alcohol & touches of vanilla. The taste is stronger although the alcohol is surprisingly well hidden given the strength, there's plenty dark malts & a few smoked flavours with earthy hops & hints of caramel alongside some dark fruits sitting in the background. Its a full bodied beer with light carbonation & a fairly thick, smooth feel that goes down well with a pleasantly warming feel to round things off; great stuff. ",4.17

Yes, black licorice is a note that I can agree with on this beer. The 11% abv is well hidden, just a slight sting.

Feel is smooth, decadently rich, light to medium carbonation.
Overall: Beautifully smooth coffee Stout sipper, very well-executed and balanced. One of Anerica’s Best.",4.62
Big Bad Baptist,"Pours black, gloriously dark with a wondrous two finger head of nicely bubbled foam. Aroma is strongly coffee and dark chocolate. I could smell this brew all day. Taste is not as carbonated as I thought, a light chocolate than anticipated and the coffee is likewise present, but subdued. None of this is truly as bad as it sounds, but is noticeable. This is very pleasant and for this ABV, very drinkable. An easy to like imperial stout.",4.43
Big Bad Baptist,"Rel #101. Pours a dark, dark brown with a faint hint of red. Fully opaque in the glass, with a think khaki colored head that quickly receded to a long-lasting cap. Aroma is really nice. Rich chocolate dominates, while the coffee and whiskey barrels have faded.

Taste is almost the opposite of the nose. No direct coffee notes, but plenty of roast and some really nice barrel flavors. There's not much in the way of sweetness, but that's not at all a bad thing. This beer is several years old, and while I can't attest to what it tastes like fresh, it has a certain balanced mellowness to it that I'm really enjoying. Full bodied and smooth going down.",3.8

The whiskey wasn't very prevalent but it was there and it helps sometimes but if i want those flavors more I'd probably look elsewhere. That being said the coffee was more subtle than SOB and this was just a more well rounded brew with the roasted coffee still slightly coming forth more.

Poured from a 375ml bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is dark amber with 1.5 fingers of tan head. Retention is average leaving a thin island of foam.
The intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of fruit, some funk, and oak. Also, there's a dirty diaper smell. It smells like a disposable diaper that's full of baby shit. How unfortunate. I hope it fades and fast.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. The taste has berries, oak, and is super tart. There's a strong wine quality. The shit filled diaper smell comes and goes. I find myself taking a whiff before each sip to make sure the coast is clear of dirty diapers.
The feel is medium in thickness. It's slightly syrupy, has almost no carbonation, and a medium astringency.
Overall, besides the dirty diaper smell, it's far too tart for my taste. With the shit filled diaper smell, it's appropriately ranked #2.",2.0

Nice aroma of honey, clover, light bread-y malt notes; slightly herbal. Mild malt flavor infused towards the finish with a nice bourbon undercurrent; spicy, anise and coriander; slight bitterness. Medium body; mild coarseness; balanced alcohol heat presence; rather dry overall.

This is an interesting and tasty take on the tripel beer style. The appearance, smell and taste all point towards its tripel baseline, delivering some nice spicy character. The bourbon barrel aging develops midway through the sip and lingers into the finish. The brewery's label description of ""subtle notes of vanilla, caramel, and oak"" weren't really perceived by me (perhaps in hind-sight I can agree with the caramel and oak points - but they didn't really standout to me). I like the beer and am glad to have one additional bottle of this beer.

Curieux,Pours a deep gold. Light foam. Fruity aroma. A lot going on here. Dried fruit and vanilla body. Not too sweet. A little oaky. Alcohol finish. Well balanced. A must try.,4.0
Curieux,"12oz bottle courtesy of Rub_This_BBQ. According to the stamp on the label, this was bottled on January 19, 2022. My first Allagash beer in somewhere between 15-20yrs. Once upon a time they were distributed here, but, sadly, that pipeline dried up long ago. I've missed them.

Poured into a Chimay goblet, this was a dark golden amber color, with a thin, bubbly, off-white head.

Fruity and spicy nose, in that order. Not that dramatic. As it warms, a little bit of boozy, bourbon-y sweetness becomes noticable.

Taste is considerably more complex than the nose. It's where the barrel aging becomes apparent. Fruity start, reminiscent of apple juice, and then things get oakey. The bourbon barrels add, in addition to notes of bourbon itself, a vanilla-like aspect, and there's a definite alcohol heat in the background.

The body is light for a 10.2% bba beer, but is definitely not truly light bodied. Mouth feel is lightly creamy.

Is this a Belgian golden ale or a tripel? If this was a Belgian tripel, as it's called here, I find it a bit lacking. I think there should be separate style when it comes to American and Belgian tripels. As an American-brewed Belgian style beer, this is pretty awesome, but it doesn't have that authentic Belgian feel or look. Then again, I've never had a true Belgian-brewed tripel this high in alcohol, at least as far as I can recall, so it's possible one wouldn't have the big, fluffy head one normally associates with Belgian abbey ales. It's very close to being a great beer, but doesn't quite get to that point for me. Anyway, style quibbles aside, I enjoyed this. The bourbon aging didn't drown out the golden ale flavors but augmented them. It's too boozy for me to want a lot of in a sitting, but this was a great beer to drink as a bit of a reward after getting some work around the house done.",4.06
Curieux,"12 oz bottle poured into a Boulevard Smokestack Stemmed Tulip

The beer pours a clear golden yellow/straw color with a huge white foamy head that slowly recedes leaving behind a moderate amount of lacing.

The aroma has a lot going on, with some banana, apricot, vanilla, peppery spice. Not much actual bourbon aroma, but there is just enough to hint at the barrel aging. Very nice and inviting

The flavor is toasty and lightly bready with some fruity notes. Banana, apricot, coconut, and vanilla complimented by a peppery spiciness, and a sharp finish. Medium bodied and well carbonated.

Overall this is a nice beer and coming in at a big 10.2% you would expect more booziness, but the alcohol is well masked, making this beer easy to drink. A great example of a style that I took way too long to come around to…",4.24
Curieux,"Bottled 4/22/21 . Let sit out for ten minutes , before opening.

Moderately hazy, with 1/2 finger of quickly-dissipating off-white head.

Smell is candied orange rind , with slight barrel aromas (oak & vanilla) .

Taste is similar to aroma, but with the orange rind element less jammy . Slight spiciness, and light bitterness. As it warms, more oak tannin becomes apparent.

Feel is slightly slick , light-medium, with moderate, very,very fine, soft-ish carbonation. Actually feels fairly light for the abv. No apparent alcohol presence.

Overall, pleasant, and surprisingly easy-drinking for what it is. I'd never guess that it's > 10% abv, if I hadn't read the label.

Feel is",4.22

Poured golden honey in color and was topped with an off white head.
Aroma spoke of simpler times, fresh herbs and hops and malts and dancing in the sunshine. No bourbon did I get, but no complaints from me. Wonderful nose.
The taste rather follows. It seems after 6 1/2 years any bourbon from the barrel has been reduced to insignificant proportions. But what remains is a very tasty triple.",4.52
Curieux,"Poured a hazy light gold with a half finger white fizzy head that dissipated quickly. Nose of mild banana, citrus and subtle bourbon. Light tastes of banana, malt, and hops. Medium bitterness and heat like white pepper or cloves. This gives way to a sweetness and oak most likely from the bourbon barrels. Medium mouthfeel and carbonation. The booziness becomes pronounced halfway through the drink. This beer started out on a bit of a ho hum with me and then really grabbed me.",4.35
Curieux,"Pours a golden yellow with soft, soapy head.

Smell is fruity and a bit yeasty with soft notes of bourbon, oak and sweet vanilla. Some traditional Belgian notes of dried fruit and banana with a hint of toffee.

Taste is fruity and a bit sweet. Notes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, toffee and some hints of dried fruit and banana chips. Very well balanced, letting the barreling really shine. Soft bitterness with a slightly phenolic finish.

Nose has hints of coffee and mildly roasted malts.

Taste is a mildly roasted malt base with the coffee adjunct blended it subtlety. Finishes with a touch of cream and is well balanced with no sign of coffee astringency.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and smooth.

Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,"Relatively short lived head with almost no lacing. This smells better than it delivers.

Wake-n-Bake Coffee Oatmeal Imperial Stout,"Appearance:
Glacé blackness so absolute it practically absorbs the light around it. Mocha froth culminates into an abundant head that laces deeply but deflates rapidly.

Bouquet:
Homemade brownies soaked in black coffee to the point of dissolving; deep beneath that rich concoction is a slender stratum of barley and raw oats.

Feel:
A creamy cascade of velvety stout whirls about the tongue with a long-lingering mousse softness. Has a dry, earthy finish.

Taste:
A robust burst of dark chocolate syrup, followed closely by smoked oats. The midpoint exhibits spicy Arabic coffee with a sprinkling of shaved cocoa nibs stirred in. Its conclusion is a hyper-fast film reel of caramel malts and vanilla bean paste, abruptly cut by a sharp, chocolatey espresso finale.

Overall:
Marvelous. The 9.4% ABV is thoroughly cloaked under a rich deluge of dark flavors.",4.59

420 Extra Pale Ale,"Poured from a 12oz can best by 11-30-2022

On the pour a thre finger head forms in my spiegelau IPA glass. The head has very good retention and becomes slightly rocky after a few minutes. Carbonation is fine and highly active.

Aroma is light woth the huge head Overton, but a slightly resinous and dank hop is present with a nice big fruity compliment. Some fermentation notes are present bringing a bit more funk.

Taste follows the aroma with a bit more fermentation, but overall this is a super drinkable hoppy ale, almost dangerously easy to put down. Very light bready malts come out at the end shrouded in the herbal and bitter hops that have lost a lot of the fruity notes once actually drank.

Feel is almost surprisingly light and drinkable. Palate is left with a dry feeling and the hops do stick around for a while, but the malts are much more present in feel and finish despite the lightness at first.

Overall this was decent, amd a nice intro to the happier side for beginners, but for some reason I was expecting a bit more outta this. I probably shouldn't have had their G13 IPA before this one though.",3.59

420 Extra Pale Ale,"Picked up a can when I was in Milwaukee last month. I guess they're part of the Miller/Coors/global portfolio now. Works for me.

Pours a dark golden color with a light amber aspect to it. Midnight wheat? Is that what gives this a slightly darker SRM hue than your average pale ale? (Much less ""extra"" pale ale) 1/4"" white head. The aroma is straight up C hop throwback mode. I appreciate it. Standard citric bitter rind and pine. Sure its sentimental.

The taste smacks similarly, although the malt bill is a smidge less ""thick"" or hefty than the appearance would suggest. Its a by the numbers C hopped pale ale that goes with a lighter non crystal malt aspect to separate it from the master that is SNPA. It really does tap into that Sierra Nevada vibe, somewhere between their historic ""maltier compared to contemporary beers"" and classic C hop crispness. I'd certainly pick up 6 of these every summer if I had the option.",3.68
420 Extra Pale Ale,"Pours a slightly chill-hazed light gold. Excellent fluffy white head and lacing.

Aromas are a mixture of pale and caramel malts and citrus. Just a touch of grassy and floral hop.

Pale mildly tart malts at the start and in midstream. Some biscuity character, along with lemon and orange. Then some grass and pine arrive, but never get to IPA volume. Very balanced. Maybe a touch watered.

Medium light bodied. Just this side of crisp. Very drinkable.

Smells of citrus hops, toasted malt, an overall balanced nose. Can conditioned, says it on the can. Believable.

Nice balance between the citrus hops and toasted malt. Some sweet notes for sure, very much hoppy notes and a dryness that usually accompanies a beer that calls itself Extra Pale Ale. Think Sierra Nevada Torpedo.

Good mouthfeel, very good drinkability.

Nice to have this option in town.",4.03
420 Extra Pale Ale,"Look: Light orange in color and the pour yields a huge billowing white head that eventually settles to a pillow, leaving behind great lacing
Aroma: Navel oranges, lemons, lime, floral hop notes, some sweet malt, candied dried fruit, and some grassy notes
Taste: A rush of assorted citrus fruits opens it up and as the hit subsides, floral and grassy hop notes follow suit – I get some Koreanspice viburnum, winter daphne, and Hall’s honeysuckle. Malt is there but light in presence and closes with more lemon-lime-led citrus fruit
Mouthfeel: Full but light, pretty clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and finishes clean and slightly soft with zero dryness
Overall: I’m digging this one. I’ve heard of this beer for years, mainly here on BA, but never had it so when I heard they were distributing in Oregon, I had to try one and it’s tasty.

You know, as stupid as it may sound, this was one of the first beers I searched for when I began drinking underage. Me and my friends lusted after it but were never able to secure it. Flash forward years later, and I find singles of it at my local store. For the hell of it, I picked one up just to see for myself what I was missing years ago (probably not much)

Pours a cloudy gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

Oh man, the cherry here is super artificial in the nose, very candy-like. I’m picking up on aromas of cherry jolly rancher, lime juice, crackery malt, earthy wheat, and light honey

While the aroma was definitely candy forward, it also promised a fruity tartness. The taste is a huge letdown in the wake of this, not very good at all. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting black cherry, cracker, sweet honey, and lemon rind. The swallow takes a nose dive in quality, bringing notes of cherry cough syrup, doughy malt, earthy wheat, and sticky seeet honey

A promising start of a light body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a refreshing beer. But it finishes sad and sticky, just way too sweet

Ok so it’s not the worst thing in the world, but it’s pretty amusing to see what younger me was missing. Not worth repeating",2.94
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,"Mostly pale in color, was definitely expecting a hue more representative of a cherry. Lots of cherry on the nose, more artificial though, really similar to a cherry 7up.

Following into a sip and a pleasant candy-like cherry flavor plays with you taste buds. There is an almost dry finish to it and at the end you're not really itching for another. A sweet fun change up, but once in awhile. Not really a go to for me, but enjoyed the experience.",3.63
Samuel Adams Cherry Wheat,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden color with a soft white head. SRM of 7. (3.50)

Aroma: Strong and intense aromas of sweet cherry upfront. There's sweet and candied cherry and faint syrup. Some bread, cream, and hints of vanilla through the end. (3.50)

Flavor: The flavor follows with more candied cherry. This is followed by a bready and soft wheat malt. Finishes creamy to clean off the cherry sweetness. (3.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate to stronger carbonation. Finishes soft and clean on the palate. (4.00)

Compared to Castle Danger's Castle Cream Ale 5/27/21: Pours a more golden color. Stronger aromas/flavors. Much more cherry obviously. Less cream and malt liquor flavor.

Overall: I wasn't sure what to expect of this one because some said the cherry was mild, while others found it overpowering. Whoever said the cherry was overpowering was right.

Raspberry Tart,"Part of the midwestern milieu migrated my direction thanks to @FBarber in NBS BIF #13.

Rusty, plum juice red colour. Small wet head that quickly disappears leaving nothing but a few stray bubbles.

Nose has some sweet and tart of the raspberries that honestly kind of reminds me of marinara sauce. Ultimately beyond that there's deep aged berry aroma, like a raspberry wine.

Oooh man. Honestly, that's fucking delicious. It is raspberry juice. It is what it is. But I love raspberries. Late season berries, deep red, cool, just a touch of bramble tart. Jammy and delicious.

Moderate body I suppose, with a dry finish in contrast to the jammy berry carrying tool, and spicy/sharp/compressed carbonation.

I'll be honest. I love raspberry. And that strongly colours my review here. But that's an important component of it. New Glarus is really good at what they do. This beer is yet another NG brew that is blatantly competently composed, and in this case (as opposed to some of the other NG brews I've been fortunate enough to try), that happens to also align with a fruit expression that is right up my alley.

Nose gives huge elements of baltic porter, like zywiec or black boss: toffee, caramalt and some solid residual brown sugar leading into a hint of oxidized hops (nose), liqourice (licorice?), plum, cane sugar, maybe some smoke (but the weber is going so who knows)

Hell of a beer, really complex. Those notes above all pertain just the same in the flavor, but just in phases. Like from fruity to chocolatey to smokey and on and on just evolving.",4.39
Imperial Stout,"Poured into a tulip a nice black colored liquid capped by a light brown head that was dense and soft looking. Dissipated fairly quickly but still looks good.
The aroma was roasted malts, and for me that is impressive, my nose is broke as far as aroma goes.
The taste, I was somewhat impressed- for a RIS it was very smooth, as in no charred malts and no extra hops, just dense and full roasted malts that bring to mind figs and coffee and chocolate. Really nice!
The feel is likewise smooth as silk, this is just a pleasure to drink.
Glad I finally tried this, it will be a regular in my cellar.",4.19
Imperial Stout,"12-oz bottle into Samuel Smith pint glass
I had been saving a bottle to review for a while. Father's Day seemed like a good occasion.

A - Samuel Smith always looks fancy, foil-wrapped bottles and all. This one pours a deep pitch black with ruby highlights under 3 fingers of thick dark tan foam, which leaves behind a very nice web of lace. Simply beautiful!

S - dark fruits, touch of chocolate, molasses sweetness, hint of lactic character; inviting

T - dark roasted malts, sweet and tart dark fruits, light sugar sweetness, wooden notes, earthy bitterness; just delicious

M - smooth medium body, moderate carbonation

O - an excellent beer all around; no complaints",4.36
Imperial Stout,"Tasty stout, very refreshing and much smoother than you expect it to be at 7% abv. Pleasantly bitter. Drank straight from the bottle on St. Patrick's Day, like the Irish lush I am.",4.3
Imperial Stout,Pours a dark brown color with a foamy head that lasts quite a while. Aroma of coffee and roasted malts. Taste is black coffee and dark chocolate. Smooth and creamy.,4.18
Imperial Stout,"little spicy kick off the backend, like if you drank water from an ancient fountain in the forest and it was full of ancient black sludge and parasites but tasty",3.58
Imperial Stout,"Pours a deep dark brown color with a finger of beige head. The nose has some roast along with a background hint of smoked wood. The roasted malts are present in the flavor profile as well along be with a trace of molasses.

Overall, this offering comes off as pretty mild for an impy stout.",3.83
Imperial Stout,"This is somehow mostly just a sweet boozy mess even tho its 7 percent. I poured into a tulip glass. Not much malt, oats, or chocolate just a sweet alcohol flavor encased in and M&M style malt shell....although I see this is under Russian imperial which does make more sense, I think this is firmly okay but not great for Russian Imperials. It's sweet, a little malt, a little smoke, but things like Expedition Stout or Narwhal are just better to me but this is getting more balanced as I drink just not spectacular.",3.71
Imperial Stout,"Appearance:
Lacquered black, showing glimpses of brown where the light leans into it. It’s topped with a half finger of dark beige fizz that disperses faster than squirrels before a feisty, jack russel. Despite this, it retains a length of drizzly lace until the glass is practically empty.

Bouquet:
Plump figs that were lightly sugared, then rolled in milk chocolate cocoa powder. The after-aroma is intermittent but impressively gourmet: roasted plums brushed with woodsy molasses and given a hearty dunk in black chocolate.

Feel:
A satin-soft full body, simmering with moderate carbonation. Dry, bittersweet linger.

Taste:
Dark malts and oats, browned in a drizzle of maple syrup. Finishes with a spoonful of earthy, dark chocolate pudding.",4.4
Imperial Stout,"a: nice solid black color. no light penetrating through. gives the glass a nice chill haze. 1/2 finger creamy dark tan head

T: A short hop note at the forefront, dark baking chocolate, figs, sea salt, overripe dark berries, prunes, plum, raisins, toasted malts, toffee, coffee and port wine. It is lightly sweet. All of this with a woody and pervasive mineral cast all over it. There are dark soda bread notes in the finish.
F: Medium-heavy bodied mouthfeel with a moderately dry medium fast finish.
O: A deliciously rich and savory Imperial Stout that has a lot of history for good reason: The famous stone Yorkshire squares. It has superior balance, excellent flavor and has never been specific to any trend. It is incredible in it's style.",4.31
Imperial Stout,"It smells so much like a typical stout that it's almost comical.  There are scents of coffee and chocolate and beery breadwater.  It's almost a stereotype in scent.

The taste follows the nose.  It's a little coffee, a little chocolate and a hole lot of beery goodness.

It's medium bodied with small amount of carbonation.  It's smooth and has a quick bitter finish with a hint of molasses.

It's really good.  It tastes like the father of stouts.  I give it a 5.4 out of 6.",4.5
Imperial Stout,"Served from the bottle in a Lagunitas mason jar.

Man, it's been waaay too long since I last dove into some Sammy Smith goodness. Let's rectify that straight away, kids. This stuff pours a deep midnight sienna topped by a finger of dirty sandstone foam. The nose comprises roasted malts, mild molasses, pumpernickel, and a touch of orange pith embedded into the background. The taste brings in more of the same, a pinch or two of cocoa powder rounding things out. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a smooth feel. Overall, a very nice bit of bulky stout, one that doesn't throw its heft around, rather preferring to please throughout. Good times.",4.06

Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"Amber pour, light haze and modest head. Good nose of floral and hops. Taste is well-tempered bitterness and a good finish with malt added in. Deschutes landed smack-dab in the center of the american Pale Ale wheelhouse with this one. Been around around a long time and well-deserved.",3.92
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"I'm not usually keen on pale ales, I'm sort of more of a pilsener guy (although back when I was young I brewed ales). What surprised me about this one was twofold: a really nicely balanced beer, with neither the hops or malt taking charge, and the alcohol content. I don't care for really alcoholic beers at my age (68).",4.23
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"can dated 3/18; today is 5/31

pours a fairly clear amber gold body with a burnt-off-white fluffy foam froth head that has moderately low retention, peaking at a finger-and-a-half and leaving occasional patches of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a super thin murked cap with a thin but defined halo

aroma is caramel malt, slight pine and orange, lemon, and grass

taste follows that up, pretty straightforwardly. orange marmalade and caramel malt take center stage

mouthfeel is higher carbonation and medium-light body that runs crisp, slightly watery, and grainy, with a crisp dry finish and a lemon-laced caramel malt aftertaste

overall:
a far from boring session worthy pale ale that aligns itself with more traditional pale's of the english variety at times, while bringing in solid pine resin notes to boot. solid digs",3.98
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"Apple cider in color. Not much of a head. Smells mild, citrus hops, hints of lemon. Malty upfront and on the body, surprisingly. The hops come out at the end. It finishes dry.
This is balanced very well— the malt and hops are blended together so well it’s a little hard to tell what’s what, and I think that’s a good thing for this beer. It’s mild, it’s subtle, it’s an easy drinking pale ale. What else could you ask for?",3.85
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"2021-03-30
12oz can served in a tulip. Dated 02-10-21. It was left in my AirBnB fridge, so I'm pretty stoked by the relatively reasonable date.

Pours a surprisingly dark amber with a medium sized head. It's not hazy, but it's not clear. There are definitely some little flakes of sediment floating around and there and settling into the bottom of the glass. Smell is nice, clear piny grassy hoppy notes and a definite malty/grain sweetness.

Taste is pretty much what a pale ale ought to be. Moderate grainy sweetness, a tiny bit of a tea like characteristic, maybe the slightest nuttiness or toffee to spice things up a little bit, medium but building pine bitter finish.

Mouthfeel is medium-light with a very dry finish. Overall, this is a classic pale ale.

2022-05-11
Another 12oz can, this one dated 2022-01-19, so substantially older than the last one. Starting to show off a little bit of the ""old hay"" characteristic I associate with old hops, but not too much. Generally, consistent with my previous notes.",4.07
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"L- Dozens of oatmeal colored random chunks sinking in a dusty amber colored beer. Short lived 2F cream light khaki foam head fades to almost nothing with minor lace. Transparency is about 50%

N-Almost nothing when cold and about the same as it warms, just a bi of caramel malt, at least no off notes.

T- Interesting oat biscuit malt hits first, then a smooth light sweetness that leads up to a lightly bitter finish. This malty sweetness is nicely balanced with a tangy hop note that keep you coming back for some more.

M- Smooth and slick with light carbonation and a finish that keeps it lightly dry with a touch of sticky thickness.

O- I had this first almost a year ago when I kept a tasting spreadsheet. I thought it was too bitter at that time, but my palate has become more experienced. This is pretty tasty at this point in my journey.",3.68
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"355 ml bottle, from Fakta, Denmark. BB date 30.05.2014. ABV is 5%. Amber colour, slightly hazy with some floaties. Moderate off-white head. Aroma of caramelized stale orange marmalade, basement and dust, a whiff of solvent. Soft mouthfeel, moderate carbonation. The flavour is mild with a slight fruitiness, the finish is drier and ""dusty"" with very moderate hops. Has apparently not had any benefit from cellaring, might rerate if I find a fresh bottle.",2.81
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"Look: Nearly clear medium-dark orange with a generous off-white head that forms a pillow up top and slowly recedes, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Lemon/lime, tangerine, warm bready malt, rose-led floral notes, lightly toasted cereal grains, and light berry notes
Taste: A slew of citrus fruits and flowers rush onto the palate and hold before bready malt notes come and join in the fold. Citrus and floral hops retake center stage and lead to a hoppy finish
Mouthfeel: Full, medium-high carbonation, very clean throughout, and slightly soft on the finish with no detectable dryness
Overall: Tasty stuff here as it should be. A Pacific Northwest cult classic and continues to be unwavering in its presentation – citrus and floral hops, good bready malt presence, clean, and ridiculously quaffable. I hadn’t had a sixer as a stand-alone in some time and it was a much-welcomed reminder of just how well-made and good this beer is and has always been. Recommended",3.93

Taste is similar with toasted and light caramel malt, hops with earth, grass, and light herbs.

Mouthfeel is low/moderate carbonation, moderate sweetness, well balanced bitterness with drying.

There's a nice malt start to the taste and a good hop presentation at the finish. Overall a very nice beer experience.",4.09
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"Great, hoppy pale ale that hits all the right marks and is very well made. I’d drink it anytime, but I wouldn’t choose it over less malty pale ales, like a hip hazy pale ale.

With that said, I’d drink this anytime and if it were the only beer available at a restaurant or bar I’d be totally ok with that.",3.5
Mirror Pond Pale Ale,"A-Copper, slight haze, minimal head
S-Almost indistinguishable, slight floral notes and some bready malt notes
T-Neutral citrus, some floral and grassy undertones, and the malts more prominent on the palate than the nose. Modest sweetness, little to no bitterness.

O-Classic pale ale",3.77
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"September 2021 bottle.

Looks: Slightly cloudy orange/gold, no head or legs.

Smells: Sour and funky, lots of fruit for an unfruited lambic (bacteria are amazing, hey?). I get apricot, orange zest, citron, green apple, pineapple, wood, a bit of bread, and apple cider vinegar levels of fermentation.

Tastes: Similar to the nose but less fruity, mostly apricot, citrus, and green apple plus the woodiness and bready malt, with the sourness and funk being more prominent. Gave me a big initial pucker but was smooth after.

Feels: Nice medium body, a slight fuzzy carbonation that doesn't linger very long.

Overall: Heck yeah. Awesome gueuze, lives up to the Cantillon hype even if it's not mind-blowing.",4.38

Aroma: Sour, tart, funky, musty, wet wood, green apple, grapefruit zest, with a touch of white grapes.

Taste: Sour, tart, slightly sweet, funky, oak, apricot, with some light lemon zesty notes.

Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation.

Overall: A nice enjoyable easy to drink gueuze. Perfect for a hot summer day.",4.34
Gueuze 100% Lambic,"Smell of tart cherries and some yeasty bread. Orange-ish pour with visible active carbonation. Flavor is tart but nothing like the kettle sours of today. More balanced, and smooth enough to allow for the fruit notes to come through. This is surprisingly mellow in the finish, with the bready notes of the yeast taking hold.

My first Cantillon offering, and shared with a couple friends at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Absolutely a must try for any beer enthusiast.",4.42

Strong aromas of barnyard funk, white wine vinegar, pears, stone fruit and citrus zest. Lighter notes of oak, grass, green apple, and vanilla.

The taste has a lot of white wine grape and pears, as well as green apple, apricot, lemon, yeast and lime zest. There's also plenty of oak and vanilla. Subtly grassy and tannic. Tart, but not overly so.

The feel is light and extremely effervescent. Crisp. Exceptionally dry on the finish.

Gueuze 100% Lambic,"2018 vintage, 33cl bottle with a picture of a little statue cherub holding a glass in one hand and the other hand is covering his genitals.

The pour is lightly fizzy, deep orange with a wisp of a white head.

Smells wonderfully like a cross between a clean-but-musty garden shed and heaps of jarred fruit, like something tended to with such intense care that it makes you warm to so much as think about it. Incredibly complex, like a living being, without anything off or too intense. Seriously one of the very best beer aromas I've come across in my 16+ years of reviewing beer.

The flavor is wonderful but not quite at the level of the aroma. Very dry and earthy yeast and bacteria start things off, not tart in the least but with the same kind of quenching bitterness I associate with the finish of a very sour candy. This dominates the first sip, but after my pallet adjusts I detect excellent fruit complexities near the middle, smoothed out wonderfully by woody tannins, finishing on the aforementioned deep dryness of ash and microbes.",4.8
Spotted Cow,"Pours a foggy yellow, nice white head collapses to a ring, some spotty lacing. Bready and grainy aroma. (are those real words). This is just one of thos beers that don't work for me.",3.27
Spotted Cow,"They call this a Saison, but think of it as a cream ale. Pale color and very unassuming nose, though the malt character is very nice. This beer really leans on its smoothness. Subtle fruit, toffee candy. Very soft and kind of foamy in a good way with barely an aftertaste. Ales like this aren't necessaily incredible, but they are incredibly hard to find in the other 49 states.",4.39
Spotted Cow,"While I found my original review to be amusing, it was too dated to remain in light of my current notes, so I am starting fresh.

Barely foggy straw yellow with a white foam head of moderate height settling to a softly persistent blanket and wavy ridge.

Like a mild, floral hefe on the nose, and closer to a Belgian wit in taste--even including a hint of orange peel and wheat--this is such an enigma (not to be confused with their very own Enigma)!

The medium body has a fine froth that comes to a tingly semi-dry finish.

No wonder it has such staying power, there's nothing like it out there, yet it's still quite drinkable.",3.97
Spotted Cow,"Got this given to me by a guy who went to Wisconsin for family and brought home beer.
Poured amber with active carbonation and an off white head.
The aroma was faint for me, I think it had some malt or other cereal.
The taste was cereal and malts first and foremost. Nice enough, but a saison should have some funk or tart, right? Not sure if any are here. The taste is great, just not a saison flavor.
The feel was good, not viscous and not watered down, just nicely quaffable.
Glad I finally got to try this, cheers!",3.89
Spotted Cow,"Great beer brewed in my state. Classified by the brewery as a farmhouse ale, the flavors are not intense yet are tangy and refreshing. Tastes of grain, malt and yeast. Easy to see why it is absolutely everywhere in Wisconsin.",4.55
Spotted Cow,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Looks very good. Glassy yellow body with a generous white head. This maintains throughout, leaving scattered lacing.

Nice light belgiany aroma, a little yeast.

On tasting, light and clean, very easy drinking, has all the hallmarks of a saison, but very much subdued.

The taste is semisweet pale malt with mild clove and relatively minimal bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Overall, excellent everyday beer.

F: light medium mouthfeel medium heavy carbonation and it doesn't taste like a very dry beer, which is nice

O: Very common where I live so its cheap but overall its an excellent local craft beer",4.05
Spotted Cow,"I rated this 4 because I rated it a 4 on Untappd (so sue me,ok). It's a good, crushable beer. The description says they leave some yeast in it. The one I just had has more rustic/barnyard funk to it than the others of this I have had I suppose becsuse of the bottle conditioning. I never really have thought of this as a farmhouse ale, even though that's what Dan Carey calls it. It's a good beer, but certainly NOT the best beer New Glarus does. My overall issue with this beer is that with as many good beers as New Glarus does do, this one is the most ubiquitous. It's EVERYWHERE in Wisconsin. There are more beers I would rather have from them if Spotted Cow wasn't taking up so much shelf space.",4.0
Spotted Cow,"Looks slightly cloudy light gold, medium loose white head.
Has an average aroma of malt and mineral water, No funk or barnyard you expect from saisons.
Tastes like a kolsch, slightly malt forward, very average beer. They state on the can that they use German ale yeast, not sure how they can expect it to magically turn into a saison.
It’s not bad tasting, just not anything resembling a farm house style ale.",2.66

Lager,"Blows Yuengling lager and Sham Addumbs Boston lager away, and it's not even close. Cost a little more than either of those imposters, but it's NYC overhyped pricing. Probably the best thing NYshitty can offer the intelligent world.",4.25
Lager,"A- This pours a dark amber/golden color, and shows off generally clear....perhaps with some mild chill hazing. There is multiple steady streams of fizz rising in slow but uniform manner, maintaining a base layer of foamy head. This, by the way is about one and a half fingers in thickness to begin with, before the eggshell colored foam slowly dissipates into a clumpy thin/thick covering over the lager. The lacing is quite sticky too, with a thick film coating the inside of my glass....a very nice looking lager beer indeed!

S- I detect a well balanced blend of caramel sweet malted barley, and the robustness of the Vienna style lager here shines, alongside a mild, yet distinct hop cone bitterness. Floral petals, muted piney notes, grassy dry grain, whole grain mountain bread and on the finish, an ever gentle peppery leafy spice.

T- Now this is a tasty lager! Flavors follow the aforementioned aromas quite closely, with piney nuances balanced out by toffee/caramel sweet malts....these also showcase some toasty quality and there is a dry biscuit graininess on the palate too. Slight pepper spice, and a bread yeast flavor that lingers after the swallow. A very decent flavorful lager!

M/O- Light and crisp in body, with perhaps a slight leaning into medium bodied territory. The carbonation is smooth yet fizzy enough to allow the full flavors to explode on the palate. I find the drinkability factor to be high and would have no issues enjoying this throughout an evening. It is a very tasty lager and in my opinion, one of the best that I have had! Excellent fare!",4.19

Damnation,"Review 1608
Damnation
Russian River Brewing
Date: 08 May 2020
Drinking through one of the lists on BeerAdovcate, this beer is next on the docket. I served the beer in a chalice around 46 degrees. The pour created a massive two-fingered creamy but airy white head. The retention is excellent, leaving gobs of lacing on the glass. The color charts around SRM 8, dark golden yellow with amber hues. The clarity is clear with loads of carbonation. A beautiful appearance.

The aromas in the beer are cloves, phenols, floral, toasted crackers, banana, a touch of funk, and earthiness.

I taste cloves, phenols, floral, herbal, green grass, toasted crackers, bready, a hint of funk, orange, banana, and earthiness.

The mouthfeel is dry and spicy.

The body is medium, has high carbonation, and has a lasting finish.

I was expecting a big, malty, and spicy Belgium beer. I got a lighter malty Belgium Beer with a dry, spicy finish. A unique take on this style. I enjoyed the differences in this beer.",4.27
Damnation,"I should issue a caveat. The bottle shop had this labeled as a Russian Imperial Stout. You stout drinkers can imagine my disappointment.
It is not that this beer is bad. Looks, smells, tastes and feels like a Belgian. Not a particularly good one so I’m surprised by the ratings. It’s spicy banana Belgian blah blah boredom all day long. Almost as if someone said, “let’s brew a prototypical Belgian.” And strong ale? At 7.5%? I have had abbey ales at 10%+ with heavy duty sediments and incredibly complex flavors. Those are Belgian strong ales. Duvel, though decidedly weaker than some, is light years beyond this. The temerity!",3.03
Damnation,"Inspired by Duvel in style, Damnation exudes the Sonoma terroir: winey, yet wonderfully dry.
The yeast reminds me of Belgium's passionate pints, particularly how the yeast works up the malts. And a dash of pepper. Spritzy.

Because Russian River produces mostly world-class Wilds (and I shy from the style), I am glad to see their excellence applied to the BSPA. Preceded by two Bay Area cheeses, Damnation went wonderfully with an impromptu pasta dish with butter and Italian parsley.",4.23
Damnation,"Uncaged and uncorked this pour produces an exceptional foamy white head on top of an opaque dirty lemon yellow body. Head lasts indefinitely. Nose is citrusy and yeasty, lots of esters. Taste follows with an almost dry spicy finish. Reminiscent of many pale Belgian brews.",4.18
Damnation,"Another great Beer by Russian River!
*Looks: Classic-Strong Belgian ale appearance, pale amber colored, semi-opaque
*Aroma: Mild malt, pilsner, mild bread/yeasty
*Taste: This a well-made, damn good Belgian Style Ale! Honestly if this were a blind tasting, I wouldn’t know the difference alongside La Fin Du Monde, Dūvel, Chimay, Westmalle etc.
*Finish: mildly warm at 7.5% abv, easy on palate but slightly, only slightly heavy.
*Overall Verdict*: Beautiful, artistically crafted, strong Belgian Ale by Russian River. Super work of art if you like Belgian style!",4.56
Damnation,"Has a decent head, beautiful hazy, Golden, effervescent look. Smell, a tad metallic, Typical yeast odor, not much smell at all. First touch in tongue yields mild bitter reaction, but mellows immediately. Notes of apricot, sour dough, some pine, and fruit notes. I don’t taste the spice, but feel the warmth from it. Overall, a mellow, but refreshing flavor. Mouth feel, is creamy and gentle, medium body. Overall, A good beer.",3.86
Damnation,"Pours a foggy pale orange with a fluffy three fingers of off-white foam. Head retention is great, forming a stoic layer above the beer for a long time. Aroma is pale, biscuity, wafery, crackery, earthy malts with slight resiny, herbal hops. A little clove rounds it out. Flavor profile is resiny, herbal, grassy hops that reside at the back of the tongue after the malts finish singing the chorus. Malts are biscuity, wafery, crackery and pale. A little lemon grass and clove lingers towards the finish. Mouth feel has a bubbly effervescent that somehow expands and fizzes on the tongue as it hits, growing the texture from start to swallow. Crispness creeps on towards the finish, after the initial foamy expansion on the tongue. Overall, bubbly and yet crisp with a refreshing display of malts and hops behind. Balance is great with a little playfulness.

It’s been awhile since I’ve had a Duvel to be honest but I think I might prefer it. That’s not to say this is bad, but Duvel is amazing. I’m not getting a lot on the nose. It’s dry with a bit of funk. I wouldn’t know it’s a Belgian immediately but after a couple of sips it’s apparent. A great beer but maybe better fresh?",4.23
Damnation,"Pours a medium straw color - like an IPA. Sweet Belgian candi sugar aroma. Flavor is very typical of a Belgian, but softer from the age. Touch of bitterness in the finish. Carbonation is appropriate, medium bodied. Overall an ok beer, might have aged it too long...

Damnation,"Golden yellow in color with light orange hues and hazy, unfiltered appearance. Poured with an obscenely large, billowy, white foam with excellent retention. Wheat malt and fruity pear aromas with light notes of under-ripe banana. Medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Creamy smooth feel with expanding boozy warmth through the finish. Sweet fruit flavors, pear and light banana followed by spicy coriander. Malty and fruity flavors on the back end with spicy coriander tapering to the end. Finished dryly with a lingering spicy flavor. Fantastic display of Belgian esters. Mellow fruitiness balanced with spiciness and boozy warmth.",4.25
Damnation,"Pours a light yellow with a mild haze to it. Huge head formation. When it calms down it recedes to a finger of pure white foam. It persists for quite a while.

Nose is yeast funk, banana, clove, mild citrus zest, perhaps lemon. Vibrant scents jumping out of the glass. Very appealing.

Taste is denser than the nose. Richer. But similar. Some nice bitterness from the hops counteracting the touch of sweetness from the malt.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with mild carbonation. Very smooth.

Not a huge fan of the Belgian Pale Ales, but I was quite impressed with this brew. Having limited access to Russian River its hard to snag bottles, but I pick one up whenever I get the chance. I look forward to seeing the rest of their accomplishments.",4.06
Damnation,"Rating from notes. 375 ml bottle purchased by my wife at City Beer Store in San Francisco, California. Consumed January 2014. ""Bang on for the style."" 3.88/5",3.88
Damnation,"I got one of these expensive bottles of World-Class beer from Whole Foods for $7 each. Poured into a stemless wine glass because I don't have a tulip or goblet, the recommended glassware for this style.

Look: The golden color of the body is reminiscent of unfiltered Buckwheat honey, an orange-hued amber. Super fluffy, frothy, choppy, and billowing slightly off-white head. The body is hazy and shows ample carbonation from the bottle fermentation. When the cork is popped, the bottle oozes smoke like some Harry Potter shit. The lacing drags down the glass like foamy bunting.

Smell: Right after popping the cork, I immediately get an incredibly complex aroma of toasted challah, fig, a touch of orange zest, phenolic clove, banana, delicate white pepper, and caramel. This stuff smells mouthwateringly good.

Taste/Mouthfeel: The incredibly rich bready taste has mounds of caramel, toasted challah bread, browned butter, light hop spice, earthy hops, biscuit, and sophisticated yeast-derived banana and fig flavors intertwined throughout the perfectly balanced yet still malt dominant flavor profile. The flavors explode across the palate as this liquid genius glides down the throat. The hopping perfectly balances and complements the other flavors, yielding pure earthy and slightly spicy mild bitterness to back things up. The body is overall a solid medium; hearty with enjoyable chewiness. The well-hidden alcohol is slightly warming as the beer comes up in temp, with a reassuring kiss of sultry euphoria that caresses the mind and spirit.

Overall: Incredible this beer is outstanding evidence of just how good Russian River Valley is. I loved digging my nose into the soft, smooth foam of the aromatic head and gulping down the cool liquid genius. Incredibly smooth and drinkable, with such deliciousness that each richly pleasurable drink makes you go ""mmm"" and smack your lips. This is one of the best breweries in the world. This beer is extremely delicious in every way. A fantastic example of the style, one of the best beers I have ever had.",4.5
Damnation,"The beer pours with much froth with a slight stinging sensation when tasted. Once adjusted, the warmth of the ale surrounds and it becomes another solemn moment in the mind of a monastery. Excellent!",4.64
Summer Shandy,"Hazy golden creamy with off white head. Lacing was modest. This the ""Arnold Palmer"" of beers. Taste follows aroma, beer with some lemon flavoring. Taste ady dtinking, but wouldn't want to drink more than one per session.",3.09
Summer Shandy,"Looks cloudy yellow. Nice lemon fragrance. Tasted like it’s created to be; beer infused with lemon. This combination works very well. Like many others have stated, this is great on a hot summer day.",3.73
Summer Shandy,"They have an origin story about a guy mixing beer with lemonade on the side of this can. That pretty accurately describes what this beer tastes like, but neither is bringing its 'A' game. On the beer end, there is light malt and an underlying steely industrial quality. On the lemonade end, it's a bit watered down. Still, it balances sweetness and tartness to an appropriate degree. It has your standard light beer feel, with a light mouthfeel and sharp carbonation. I enjoyed it for its freshness and it is better than most macros you can buy if only for its lemon flavor.",3.3
Summer Shandy,"L - Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy light color with a one finger head that dissipates down to a film and then a ring. Agitation brings back a half finger head.

S - Some light malt scents but lots of lemon and citrus scents.

T - Taste follows scent as a lemonade flavored beer. There is some mild flavorful grapefruit bitterness in there as well.

F - Medium mouthfeel with some zesty carbonation.

O - Overall this is a solid summer option. Very good in 95+ degree weather. I like that this gives me the flavor like a hard lemonade, but doesn’t come in overly sweet or sugary. I’d recommend this as a solid summer, outdoor, and camping option",3.44
Summer Shandy,"It's a hot day. You're thirsty and don't want water. You're out of your daily drinker and there is no lemonade either in the fridge. Well. Leinenkugel has you covered ; a lemonade flavored beer. The review is easy here. Lots of lemon in the nose, bright yellowish soda color, above average carbonation. Taste follows nose. A decent thirst quencher that deserves a small spot in your fridge during a heat wave",3.31
Summer Shandy,"12oz bottle into a pint glass. Best by 7/18/22. Plenty fresh.

Looks decent enough in the glass. Cloudy yellow with orange hints body. Small white head shrinks to a ring and covering, spotted lacing.

Smells like lemonade.

Tastes like lemonade too.

Mouth just about reaches medium, finish a musty lemon.

Overall, had this today in defiance of snow showers falling in NE PA. I get this would be great in the dog days of summer, but there are far better options for that.",3.26
Summer Shandy,"This beer besides smelling great, really sucks. They were BOGO at a supermarket near me so I have about 8 bottles left. I wonder if this beer is good with a lime or lemon in it?",3.18

Summer Shandy,"This is tied for my all time favorite beer along with Wittenkerke's white ale.

Very crisp, and light. One of those shandy/fruity beers that still tastes like beer. Taste is great, just a little bit tart and very refreshing. Mouthfeel is a bit sharp at times, but man is this a delicious beer if you like light, crisp and tart.",4.77
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Vitus pours a cloudy but rich looking brew and lacks any head. The aroma is rich with fruity. Apple, pear but not the banana. The taste is awesome and is sweet and fruit forward. The mouthfeel is glorious because of its sweetness. Overall a super double throw down of a weizenbock. #2 must try #1",4.75
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Wow! Wanted the Weihenstephaner Hefeweizen. Storekeep reccomended the Vitus. Glad he did. Great looking, great smell, great taste, no aftertaste, wife (who likes a good Hefeweizen) was very pleased. Checked all the boxes at a high level.",4.58
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Hazy straw color, big white head, lacy; Rich interesting flavor, unique, sweetish; Mouthfeel is okay but not special, This beer seems off the mainstream, what an unusual flavor.",3.98
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Appearance: Pours a slightly clouded (80% clarity) medium golden color with a sizable white head that lingers. SRM of 7. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas upfront of bready malts, citrus, bread spice, banana, juicyfruit bubblegum, and more Belgian spices. Definite German aromas. (4.25)

Flavor: Strong flavors of rich bread, banana, bread spice and yeast. More banana than the nose. Some Belgian spices including cloves and bubblegum to support. Sweet banana bread lingers off the finish with maybe hints of darker fruit, but they are not pronounced. (3.75)

Feel: Medium to larger bodied. Strong carbonation as expected. A malty, but balanced, clean finish from the yeast and carbonation. However the booze is slightly detectable off the end. (4.00)

Overall: My first at the Weizenbock style. This one drinks very well. Nice banana bread, bread spice, bubblegum flavors. Sort of like a Hefeweizen with a bit more citrus and fruity characteristics. Don't get too much dark fruit, but probably buried by the bready flavors. Only criticism is the booze is slightly detectable. I think this one could drink even better cut down 1-2% in ABV. Nevertheless, my first impression at this one is pretty good. (Rating:",3.96
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"500ml (16.9 ounce) bottle poured into a Duvel tulip glass.

T---Lovely, complex flavors abound. Banana, clove, apricot, yeastiness. A flavor palate to easily compare to Belgians.

F---Full bodied. Lightly creamy.

O---Flat out excellent. I'm glad I went for the splurge.",4.49
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"500ml bottle, no obvious bottle date, 0062 stamped on the reverse label, poured into a 16oz tumbler glass.

The aroma is very pleasant, big clove and banana yeast, bubblegum, citrus, spice, wheat, and a bit of booze. The flavors are very good, lots of stone fruits, clove, spice, bubblegum, wheat, fusel alcohol, wildflower and some lingering straw earthiness. The mouthfeel is good, coating and creamy, lively medium, body that finishes easily but with a dry warmth from the booze.

F: Very smooth & creamy, slightly thick, medium light bodied mouthfeel that is gently sticky, wet and has a medium fast finish. Gently crisp then smooth & flat.
O: A wholesome, sumptuous and refined beer with positive attributes in every way. Fruity, soft and bready with a light enough body that the 7.7% ABV essentially disappears. It is world-class in it's style and it simply one of the best tasting beers I've ever had.",4.74
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"I have been drinking American craft beer for about 15 years now, and I was always impressed how great American hops and malts were. I didn't know what I was missing with German beer. Absolutely world-class brew poured into a pint glass at 52F.
Pours a slightly cloudy light gold with a white head that dwindles down to a ring around the glass that persists.
Smells of wheat, banana, divinity with nuts bordering on marshmallow.
Taste follows the smell; it's sweet, but it's not syrupy. If this beer does contain hops, they are so well blended that it's indistinguishable on the front end. Possibly a tiny bitter hit in the aftertaste.
Fantastically well blended and carbonated. Velvety smooth with a medium body makes it very easy to drink. Alcohol is quite unnoticeable.
I can see why Weihenstephaner has top ranking brews in at least two categories, as their beer is world-class AMAZING! Overall, I would be shorting them if I didn't give it a full 5 across the board.",5.0
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Pours a murky straw color with slightly less than a finger of head. The nose is yeasty and has some citrus notes. It also has something sweet that is hard to place. The flavor has herbal qualities and the same indistinct sweetness as the nose. The body is fairly hearty.

Weihenstephaner Vitus,"0.33 L bottle
Bottle Date: 9201 (26 May, 2021 ?)
Glass: Tulip
Pouring Temp: 44 F

Look:
Opaque golden yellow with a creamy white head that fills the space in the glass not filled with liquid. The head slowly collapses to a consistent cover. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Citrus fruits. Ripe banana. Honeysuckle. Light honey such as acacia or clover. Allspice and cloves. There is a restrained sweetness that undergirds everything.

Taste:
A citrus bite starts things off mixed with sweet banana. The allspice and cloves then bite some and keep things in balance. There is a nice flowery note as well. The finish is soft and sweet with a touch of fading cloves. The spices accumulate as the beer is consumed.

Feel:
Soft, smooth and creamy. Body is medium with a lean towards the full side.

Overall:
A tasty and complex Heller Weizenbock. I prefer Dunkler Weizenbocks like Aventinus, but this beer isn't a slouch by any means. For me, this is a good beer for spring and early summer. I actually view it as a Weizen-based Maibock, with the cloves standing in for hops.",4.12
Weihenstephaner Vitus,"Hefeweizen appearance--hazy golden, just slightly translucent, with huge cap of foamy white head. Great retention, due to the wheat, no doubt.

On the nose, underripe mango, dried apricot, (good call from the brewery description) banana, vanilla, hay, white pepper, rich chewy white bready malt.

The mouthfeel is hefty and fluffy but made superbly drinkable through the fairly high carbonation that cuts through it.

A Weizenbock. This is a great beer.",4.36
Anchor Porter,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
The body is inky black with a half inch of brown head with a mild pour. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium. There are notes of malt, salted toffee, rich dark chocolate and black coffee. It smells wonderful.
The intensity of taste is medium high with a dryer and more hoppy flavor than the aroma suggests. Normally, I loath hoppy porters, but Anchor got this one right. With a swallow, the flavor keeps going. There are flavors of toffee, deep dark chocolate, more black coffee than in the aroma and a long pronounced hoppy flavor that's medium in intensity. It's rich and delicious. I've missed having a go to dark beer after New Castle changed. This will likely be it's much better replacement. I usually support local Austin breweries, but this is a much better beer than 512 Pecan Porter which is much more expensive for a four-pack compared to a six-pack of this.
The thickness is just under medium. It's quite dry with a low level of astringency. Well, I finished the bottle before I could accurately detect the level of creaminess. With it's 5.6% ABV, I'm feeling a little numbness in my face. I will open another bottle tomorrow to finish this.
The level of creaminess is high. The carbonation is unique. The bubbles are tiny and tickle the tongue creating a effervescent quality. It has a lot of world class qualities in the mouth feel alone.
Overall, I'm amazed by how excellent this is. After trying a few beers that I didn't care for, Anchor Porter reminded me how truly great a beer can be.",4.72

and roast with subtle dark fruit hints. Flavors hit the mark with dark fruit notes
of black and raspberry, dark cocoa, dark coffee, char, and balanced sweet
caramel malts. Nice mouth feel; medium full body edging towards medium,
smooth, lightly coating, light carbonation, and a balanced char and roast finish

This is a superb everyday Porter, richly delicious, tastes of coffee, mild chocolate, dark malt. Drinks light. Finishes crisp. Excellent American display of the style.",4.15
Anchor Porter,A true American classic. This porter is quite a treat bursting with caramel and chocolate notes. A deep brown dark chocolate color with a nice white-brown head is magnificent. Raise to your nose and you are met with roasted aromas and the beer tastes malty and smooth like melted dark chocolate. A great beer reminiscent of a mocha coffee.,3.9
Anchor Porter,"From the rear label: ""PKG050521""

Appearance: It has a black body with a large, thick, khaki head. The head has a creamy texture on top with shallow lumps and ripples across its surface. Head retention is good and as it slowly recedes it leaves a nice sheet of thick cobweb lacing with large round gaps in the sheeting. It looks exactly like you would picture a Porter in a magazine.

Aroma: There isn't much going on in the aroma here. It has a bit of a phenolic, rubbery scent. As the beer sits there is a scent of nail polish. Very odd aromas.

Taste: Up front there is nail polish and a bit of toasted caramel. Towards the middle the nail polish character comes through even stronger. There is a pleasant note of coffee and faint burnt carbon. The nail polish character really kills the other flavors.

Mouthfeel: There is a medium roasted grain bitterness to the beer and a body that rests on the upper edge of medium. Carbonation feels fine. Drinkability is low given the flavor and aromas.

Overall: A very disappointing beer. The off-flavors in this beer really hamper any positive characters that might have a chance at getting out. I wouldn't recommend this beer. I wouldn't buy it again unless I could try it directly from the brewery to see if it was an issue with the batch, the packaging, or if the recipe is consistently like this.",2.11

Anchor Porter,"Bottled 2/23/21

Yet again, how have I not yet tried this beer? An absolute classic, especially amongst the early craft beers. From what I have read before, I was under the assumption that this was actually an English Porter, which I tend to enjoy a little bit more than their harsher American counterparts. Anyways, I’m excited to finally try this, no matter what it is

Pours a very dark brown with a finger of creamy tan head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

The nose here strikes a balance I really like between burnt bread and sweeter malt. I’m picking up on aromas of roasted barley, dark bread, lightly acidic coffee, chocolate malt, and very mild earthy hops

A slightly less delicate balance is achieved in taste, leaning more into the bitter and roasty side of things. As I said, this is not particularly my preference, but it is well done. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dark roast coffee, roasted barley, herbal hops, dark chocolate, and toffee. The swallow brings notes of dark bread, doughy malt, light raisin, herbal hops, and milk chocolate

A medium body pairs with moderate carbonation, resulting in a biting yet smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slowly expanding sweetness

This is crafted beautifully. While not the most impressive porter I’ve had, the execution is just incredible. I need to get this more often",4.2

Tan head above a deep. dark brown but clear beer. The head slumps quickly to a ring and film.
A swirl kicks up the foam and allows the sweet charred grain aromas out. Molasses and maple, campfire and singed spruce tips.
Rich flavors of grilled cherries and leather, scorched sugar and red wine tannins. Just on the edge of sour notes move in mid swallow, slightly astringent bite at the back. Sweet and dry the hops lend a firm bitterness to the smokey malt base.
Body is light - medium - rich in flavor not heavy in body.
A classic Porter bordering on robust. Obviously not a fresh bottle yet still more than enjoyable.",4.33
Anchor Porter,"(355 ml bottle). Pours with a large tan head, colour is very dark, nearly black (= very, very dark ruby when held to the light). Lovely complex aroma where coffee, dark chocolate, prunes, oak and sandalwood shine through. Flavour is initially sweet and mellow, then a distinct bitterness comes through.

Temptation,On tap at Iron Abby in Horsham PA. Pours a hazy gold with thin white head. Smells of grapes and oak. Nice tart flavor and finishes with a little tartness on the tongue. A very nice sipping beer.,4.32
Temptation,"Bottled 1/14/21

Oh man, it’s about damn time I get to try some of the Russian River Wilds! I managed to wrangle up 4 different ones, and plan to try them in order of lowest to highest ranking, starting here just short of the top 250 at #310. I’m too excited so let’s just get into it

Pours an opaque pale gold with a finger of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is super funky in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of earthy white wine, wet hay, old leather, sharp oak, lemon juice, pear, apple skin, and light white pepper

The funk really keeps up in taste, it’s soft and delicate up front yet tart and funky on the finish. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting dry white wine, pear skin, white grape, smooth oak, and light apple. The swallow brings notes of earthy white wine, sharp oak, wet hay, clove, lemon juice, apple skin, and leather

A light medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a sharp beer. Finishes quite dry and funky

This one is very good, but the straight up funk holds it back just a little bit. Still, it’s masterfully done, and I can’t wait to try the rest",4.28
Temptation,"Had a 2014 on tap in 2022
Look - Clear golden color with a nice white head and slight lacing. Shocked it looks this good
Smell - grainy tart citrus. Guessing the aging brought it to this smell but still fantastic
Taste - floral tart with a slight citrus
Feel - medium body with a crisp carb
Overall - really great beer. Would love to try fresh and see the difference",4.27
Temptation,"Had this right after PtY, been wanting to try this almost as long as Pliny. Certainly one of the top sours I haven’t been able to try. Fathom Bistro & Bar on Shelter Island, San Diego. So much funk and delicious barrel character. The definition of a sour blonde. Wayyyy to easy to drink. Wow!",4.76
Temptation,"Golden color, nicely hazy, with a fizzy white head that dissipates quickly. The nose is green grape, lemon, oak, and da funky Brett.

The taste is very refined, with the green grape and funky Brett up front and the oak and lemon at the back of the palate, with a lingering flavor profile that is delicious.

The mouthfeel is bright and fizzy, per the style. An excellent wild ale, IMHO.",4.46
Temptation,"Bottled 3-27-2020. Poured in Tulip.
Excellent chardonnay aroma with slight earthy notes. Chardonnay is the main note in the taste followed by some apple and pear. Very dry and bitter. Tasty.",4.62
Temptation,"Bottled 6 months ago.

Pours semi-hazy sunshine orange with a persistent off-white head.

The nose is lemon, peach, pineapple, oak, and light cheesy funk.

The taste follows. Lemon, pineapple, orange, and oak. Low to medium tartness.

The mouthfeel opens medium and finishes dry. A touch too dry in my opinion.

Overall, very good. Delicate and complex. My one knock is that it leans bitter and dry on the finish, which undercuts the fresh fruit notes that are so prominent on the nose.",4.38
Temptation,"*Aroma: Oaky, white wine, Chardonnay
*Looks: Pale amber, lemony hazy, 1.5 finger head that sticks around
*Taste: AMAZING! What a superbly made beer! Notes of Chardonnay, but slight sour ale notes with perfect dryness, this is a truly well made, work of art! I am speechless.
*Finish: Balanced, delicious, champagne-like but sour ale! Better than most Belgian Sour Ales. And that’s saying a lot.
*Overall Verdict*: A+++ all the way. Russian River has made an instant winner with this beer at 7.5% abv, super smooth, amazing balance, amazing sour notes balanced by carbonation. Perfect style for whatever the style it represents!",4.82
Temptation,"RR beers are incredibly difficult to find on the East Coast, especially in PA, where (according to one source) they are randomly distributed. Was very excited to discover a few dusty bottles dated 050118 at Waywood Beverage in Kennett Square, PA. Opened on 1-10-20 and poured into a champagne flute.

A: Clear straw gold. Rocky white head that settles quickly. Some lacing remains after letting the beer open up for a minute.

S: Strong lactic sourness. Vinous white wine notes followed by golden raisin. Initially detected a sweet citrus (tangerine) aroma. Apparent oak tannins on the nose.

T: Carbonic bite followed by golden raisin, citrus and lactic acidity. The acidity is not as sharp as I had assumed from the aroma - its actually far more restrained and well balanced, like a sparkling moscato or chardonnay.

M: The combination of high carbonation and tannins create a full mouthfeel despite the thin body. Some lingering silkiness, perhaps owing to soft water (pure speculation).

O: Very well rounded flavor profile and balanced body. This is an elegant and quaffable beer, with just enough funk and acidity to be rustic and refreshing and not toilet stall and corrosive.",4.94
Rübæus,"Got a nitro draft from City Tap in a pint glass with a finger of white nitro head on top. Smells mildly of raspberries. Very pink color. Taste is excellent, only mildly sour, a little sweet, and lots of raspberry flavor. Light bodied with a very creamy nitro texture. Excellent nitro tap.",4.37
Rübæus,This beer takes pink. Strange flavor that is not quite raspberry but looks like pink sparkling wine. Flat with no real head and the second did taste better colder in the bottle instead of a slow pour into a glass. No recommendation here. Try Leinenkugel's® Berry Weiss since it is a better pour.,2.33
Rübæus,"Bottled 11.19.21 11 is my lucky number but 4 month old beer isn’t usually lucky. Work in 12 hours put me in a bad mood so here we go.

L: cranberry juice, low white head. Legit looks like classy cranberry juice.
S: puke berries. Like gross.
T: smooth red berry taste. Actually kind of impressed. No medicine taste just a cranberry taste without the bitterness. Just surprisingly great. For what it is.
F: medium body, low if any carbonation, creamy. Very pleasant.
O: I don’t have much bad to say about it besides the smell. Definitely worth trying, not worth a 2nd try for most people but I bet some people would seriously love this brew. Ladies try this, men, u can live without.",3.25
Rübæus,Really bright pink. Smells almost like cherry medicine; very floral and fruity. Smells bright and refreshing. Taste is really sweet. Tastes like fresh raspberries. Very little to make you think it’s a beer. Feel is light. Small bubbles and very refreshing.,3.96
Rübæus,"Poured a red-ish weak iced tea color and was topped with a pink (yes, pink) head. Not a lot of lacing.
The aroma was all about the raspberries, but as this is a raspberry ale, that makes perfect sense. They nailed the smell.
The taste, well, follows. Pure raspberry with *just* enough malt presence to keep it from being a hard soda.
Feel is surprisingly viscous - not syrupy but not thin. Really made me slow down and enjoy a bit.
OA, if you like the taste of Raspberries or fruited beers, give this one a try. If you don't, well, don't!",4.07
Rübæus,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tulip glass. Bottled on 4/19/21, so plenty fresh.

L---Clear, rich red color with a fluffy, light pink head. Head had good retention and left good lacing.

S---Well, raspberries.

T---Still raspberries. But it smells and tastes like real, fresh raspberries. A one trick pony, but it's pretty good at that trick.

F---Light/medium body with good carbonation.

O---A really nice one from a world class brewery. They absolutely hit what they were aiming for.",4.02
Rübæus,"A: Poured from the 12 oz can into a pint glass. The beer is a dark red color that is clear when held to light. Head is foamy, off-white, and 2 fingers with moderate retention.

S: Sugary raspberry jam with a bit of bread and pie crust to hold it together. Not complex, just fruitiness and a bit of pie. Not that that's a bad thing...

T: A bolder, juicer flavor than I was expecting. This isn't quite in your face but the taste is all raspberry all the way through and has a lot of character. There is a certain something holding it together, so it's not just juice and it's not a sugary mess.

Overall: More elevated and drinkable than I thought. I was picturing a sort of lambic, but this is not tart at all. It has a pleasant juiciness to it, and it feels like a nice summer drink.",4.0
Rübæus,"Pours dark pink with an off-white head. Faint fieldberry on the nose. The taste is sweet/tart raspberry with a nice malty background. You can tell that this is real raspberries and not just flavouring. A nice summertime quencher.

Rübæus,"On tap at Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger (also available there on 355 ml bottles). Red colour, thin off-white head. Strong and lovely aroma of ripe raspberries and raspberry flowers. Medium sweet flavour, distinct notes of raspberries throughout, refreshing. Nice fruit beer.",3.77
Rübæus,"Fruity and beery enough in good measure, so if you're gonna drink fruit beer this one is suited to the job. Raspberries properly the flavour the beer, but is maybe not solid enough on the nose. Pale pink, not much by way of a head or lacing. Drink this if you like raspberries. Simple and tasty is what it is about.",3.81
Rübæus,"Clear pour with pink and raspberry tone. Impressive white head with light pink shade. Lacing was good. Aroma was nothing crazy, but with tad hints of raspberry. Most likely due to puree mix. The taste was dominated by raspberry, but not overwhelming. I also tasted tart and malt. Moderate carbonation with light body. Surprising smooth. Only 15 IBU and reasonably priced. Fruit beers are easy to mess up, but the overall balance presented well for me.",3.88
Rübæus,"Raspberry red, not much of a head. Smell is muted— strawberry, apple, a watery softness. Taste follows— raspberry, strawberry, apple, light sourness on the finish. As I drank it, it seemed to get a bit more syrupy. Feel is nice, moderately carbonated.
If I had a sip of this blind I might guess that it was a raspberry soda. It’s good for sure, but I’m left wanting a bit more complexity from it.",3.74
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Picked up a 500 ml can from TW-Greenville, SC 6-8-22 for $2.49. Canned 11-8-21; best by 11-8-22; consumed 8-29-22.

Beer poured a chilled golden orange with a very nice long lasting white head.

Nose is very nice; banana and clove are very prevalent.

Taste is a light wheat malt base that allows the yeast to show forth the yeast properties that give forth banana, bubblegum, and a touch of cloves. Finishes balanced but lacking a burst as the flavor kind of falls away.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and fairly smooth.

Overall a very nice hefe!",4.07
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Huge dense white head, well laced, under a cloudy gold body. Aroma is just what you should expect of the style: yeast, banana, cloves, a touch of spice and floral hops. Soft, grainy flavor incorporates what the smell is providing in a neat, balanced package. Creamy, lightly carbonated, medium bodied mouthfeel.",4.31
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Appearance: Cloudy, gold. Mousse-like, frothy white head with excellent retention.

Aroma: Yeasty esters of banana, clove and fruits.

Flavor & aftertaste: Semi-sweet, bitterness is barely noticeable. Yeasty flavors mixed with grains and bread.

Mouth feel: Full bodied, creamy and soft. Medium length finish with a slight trailing bitterness.

Overall: Poured from a pint can. Excellent Hefeweizen. Expect nothing less from Paulaner and other German based breweries. Typical yeasty aromas and flavors with the signature creamy, soft mouthfeel. Virtually no bitterness. Right up there with Weihenstephaner, Ayinger and others. Just a bit short of Schneider Weisse Tap 7, which is quite unique. Very enjoyable.",4.63
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Well this is my 4,000 beer review which I had a couple weeks ago at my little nephews 3rd birthday party. I remember it being rather warm at the time so to me it gave off a bit of metallic skunk taste but when I had it but it did have a great level of Bubble gum esters some wheat and and good dose of banana and coriander. At this the time I did wish I had a Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier and I still stand by it since those are more clean and I could drink those all day.

Appearance: A pleasant dark copper viewed from the top, with minimal head. Can't see through stone, so I can't say much else :)

Smell: So sweet. Bananas, of course, and vanilla pudding, cloves.

Taste: Very much in line with the nose. Banana, toffee, sweet bread, green pear. Nice mild hops in the finish, slightly herbal. Delicious.

Mouthfeel: Soft and creamy, goes down very smoothly.

Overall: A classic Hefeweizen. I didn't want to stop drinking.",4.36
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"First impression? Not my favorite. It just seems a bit darker than other Hefeweizen’s, and it has too much seasoning going on (just like every time Aunt Betsy cooks Thanksgiving dinner). Now, don’t get Raul wrong; Aunt Betsy is legit, and I’ll shotgun a Pabst with her any day of the week; but I guess I just like lighter Hefeweizens with, dare I say it? Maybe a tad bit of bubble gum to them. Yeah, I dunno…all of a sudden Raul is thinking when he should be drinking. I’m outta here.

Every now and then try and remind the ones that you love that you love them, my minions.",3.61
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Poured from an 11.2oz bottle

The look is just a touch lighter than an amber, with a decent haze but you can still see through it pretty well, translucent I guess. Pretty decent carbonation but not the most intense. It's an attractive beer for sure. Head is less than one finger on the pour but retention is very impressive maintains a fine cap for as long as there still iGerman. No lacing though.

Aroma is obviously very yeast forward with strong banana orange smells almost like a wit beer but just malt and hops. In the back a nice dry malt aroma.

Flavor follows the aroma but less orange notes and more dry fermentation notes. A light acidity going on here. A light malt aftertaste rides along with some banana chip notes for a clean very vaguely bitter finish.

Feel is all from the head bringing a nice creamy mouthfeel from fine bubbles, but still light enough to be a nice warm weather beer. Also has a big enough body to bring it to year round status.

Overall a nice traditional hefeweisen pretty balanced and as usual not a lot of hops. Not sweet but not bitter a nice yeast and malt beer here good if you just want something actually german.",3.96
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Best by 10/22

This is one of the classic Hefes, and other than Weihenstephan, I haven’t had many of the German examples of the style. Surprising, considering Weihenstephan is one of my favorites of all time and I enjoy the style. Let’s get into it

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 3 fingers of off white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves minimal lacing

This one takes a sweeter approach in the nose that I quite enjoy. I’m picking up on aromas of banana, sweet honey, bready malt, pear skin, bubblegum, and earthy wheat

While this tastes pretty good, I think it may be overly fruity. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting earthy wheat, banana, orange zest, doughy malt, and clove. The swallow brings notes of banana, raisin, bubblegum, earthy wheat, bready malt, pear skin, and light herbal hops

A medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a smooth beer. Finishes mostly dry but again the fruity notes shine too much

Despite my one nitpick with this beer, it is delicious. A nice session beer",4.09
Hefe-Weissbier Naturtrüb,"Poured from the can, the look of this beer is absolutely gorgeous. Opaque, thick looking beer with a thick creamy white head, lines of bubbles rising from the bottom, streaking you the brownish-red body of the beer. Striking look in the glass.

The smell is a strong point for the beer, mild banana, orange peel citrus notes, backed by a malty-bready smell.

The taste is where a lot of the really highly rated beers on here fall a bit for me. I won’t deny that it might simply be my expectations are too high. Despite that, the taste is still phenomenal compared to almost all beers out there, it’s just relatively straightforward. Citrusy clove taste that waxes and wanes with a very mild peppery taste. Very sweet wheat taste, though not as powerful as the smell would indicate. A little creamier than other weissbiers! Which I enjoyed. Plentiful carbonation without too strong of a bite makes it taste very smooth and creamy.

Love that malty wheat flavour on the exhale",3.89

Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,"pretty solid winter warmer. was spicy and grainy and definitely a warmer. was the highlight of the holiday variety pack for sure, but still a middle ground warmer. if you're looking for a solid sipper, it checks the boxes, but isn't a high caliber warmer or worth the purchase of the pack on it's own merits. shame there's only two in the box, but also, don't believe i'd sit and sip this one past 2-3 anyhow.",3.85
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,"Old Fezziwig is among my favorite Sam Adams beers. There is a lot of flavor going on. It's simply delicious. That's saying a lot for a guy who loves German beers & not many American beers. But this beer, a spiced ale, has an abundance of malt flavor & spicy notes along with many of the darker notes of a German dunkel, like a bit of caramel & some of the lighter notes of a porter. This is a great beer.",4.51
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,There are much better winter warmer beers out there. The look is unappealing - just dark with no sparkle. The taste is all malt and there is little spice character and the aftertaste is medicinal. Spend the extra money on a better beer.,1.83
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,"Clear deep reddish-amber, with about 1/2"" of light tan head, that leaves a thin ring and surface sheet of foam.

Smell is toffee, caramel, light biscuity malt, and hints of nuts and (moist) dried fruit. The overall aroma is good, but quite light.

Taste is mostly a light mix of toffee, caramel, raisin, and cooked nuts, with brief flashes of orange rind, clove and, nutmeg, finishing with a general light spiciness (coriander & black pepper) that lingers a bit.

Feel is medium, barely-slick, with moderate, moderately-bitey , fine carbonation.

Winter warmers are not among my favorites - more of a once-in-awhile-in-the-right-mood thing - but I'd put this among the top echelon of those. I used to get a 6er or 2, when you could do that, but at this moment, the 2 in the 12pk is plenty. Good while it lasts, but that's plenty enough. :)",3.78
Samuel Adams Old Fezziwig Ale,"Fantastic holiday beer. It has a slightly spicy gingerbread smell, but not overpowering. It has a light malt flavor up front with mild but noticeable hop flavor and finishes with a nice sweet aftertaste. It is not so thick or syrupy as you might expect, the mouthfeel is about like a normal brown or amber ale. All in all, I am very happy with the balance. It is a winter warmer without being overdone and it is super smooth and easy to drink. It certainly lives up to its reputation as a fine holiday beer.",5.0

Taste - The initial taste is caramel and toffee with the ginger and orange peel lingering in the background. Can't detect much of the cinnamon, and has some very slight bitterness on the tail end.

Aroma of dark malts with toffee. Also expresses spices of nutmeg, cloves, and cinnamon.
Taste is a mix of the dark roasted malts and the spices. Has toffee from the malts. Has spices of black pepper, cinnamon, and nutmeg. All quite subtle, but the aftertaste brings the spices into the nose.
A little thinner than medium mouth feel. Very little sweetness nor bitterness. Mostly a savory presentation. Good carbonation.

F: Very crips, high carbonation, lightly syrupy.

This is the very definition of crushable and would always be in my beer fridge if I had regular access to it. Highly recommended if you like the WCIPA style, which I do.",4.42
Perpetual IPA,"Beautiful medium amber with a sticky, clotted head of white foam. Great lacing and persistence keeping the beer capped from beginning to end.
Hop aromas fill the room upon pouring. Grapefruit, lavender and sage mix with bread dough and honey in an inviting mix of smells that draw you in by the nose.
Light sugars up front are followed by sharp hop flavors of more citrus rind, bitterness comes in quickly washing most of the malt character and body away.
Highly attenuated and light on the tongue this is a hop showcase and offers only a hint of balance, but thats almost enough.
Very drinkable with a mild, lingering hop bite on the finish.
This is a weak Imperial IPA that lacks malt body,flavor and balance. It is in my opinion and decent IPA, as 7.5% is not quite Imperial level and the grain and malt presence is overshadowed sharp hop flavors .

Clear gold, with 1.5 fingers of medium-coarse ivory head, that leaves a few spots of lacing.

Taste is mostly pine and grapefruit rind, with a little grass & green onion, and a light, helles-like, honey-on-toasted-grain element , near finish. Moderate bitterness.

Feel is light-medium, barely slick, with moderate, soft, semi-creamy carbonation, that finishes slightly drier, and with a mild bite on the tip of the tongue.

Overall , a pleasure. First time having this not-old, and won't be the last (I hope). An old(ish)-school type of IPA, but the feel of it pushes it above most. Dangerously easy-drinking. (On to #2 , as I'm typing this. ;) ) Give it a try if you like that sort of thing. :)",4.17

Hop Wallop,"A smooth drinking IPA that pours into a gorgeous golden haze with about a 2 inch white frothy head. The head lingers for a while in the glass which is great. The beer gives off wonderful hoppy.earthy aromas with a tropical twist. The taste follows the nose giving pine and floral like notes, but with some tropical fruit notes too. This definitely packs a wallop at 7.5%, but does drinks more like a session. Could definitely have more than one, but I would not advise, as the alcohol could sneak up on you.

Hop Wallop,"I’ve been saving this bottle for a few years only to pull it out after a Hop Devil. It is still one of my favorites. Great flavor, color, nose, and flavor. Victory excels again.",4.85
Hop Wallop,"Appearance:
Liquid gold. Pure, clean, and translucent. Looks like an ale you'd expect to see in the tavern of a great dwarven kingdom, just don't drink too deeply, or too greedily. Puffs up a layer of choppy white foam that disappears after introductions are over, living on only as a pattern of sticky, striated lacing.

Bouquet:
Floral, earthy notes but their aroma is dainty and distant, like flowers far away on a mountain. Traces of dried pine occasionally waft in on that far-off mountain breeze. Pleasant, but falls profoundly short of being impressive.

Feel:
A cold, babbling brook of bubbles cascade gently on this light-bodied ale. Crisp with a dry, tangy finish that promises to linger but ends up dipping out early.

Taste:
Bright, semi-sweet pine, quiet notes of pepper, and a wisp of lemongrass all stand before a crackery malt backbone.

Overall:
Meh? It’s pleasing, refreshing, and there's nothing wrong with it but it’s meek and doesn't add anything new to the genre. A serviceable, middle-of-the-road IPA that'll never stand out but sometimes that's just what the menu calls for.",3.47

Hop Wallop,"Had this several times before my dad gave me a 6-er about two weeks ago. I have one of these left but here are my thoughts now.
Poured into a tulip, the appearance was a semi-dark yellow branded color with some transparency about it. Some carbonation seem rising at a modest pace. Lace coats in a semi-dusty way but clingy.
The aroma had a strong citrusy pithy/bitter rind character strolling in for a balance with some bitter piney hop tones. Malts seem barely there.
The flavor leaned towards the bitter side with a touch of sweet pine dry needles arranging underneath. Mild pine tree aftertaste, fairly dry.
The mouthfeel was pretty dry running along my tongue. Holding it's own as its scraping like what I remember of old school IPA's/DIPA's. Sturdy carbonation and good for the style. Sure is a sipper. Finishes bitter through dry pine tree notes.dry

Hop Wallop,"It pours clean, retains a slight head with fine lacing, looks decent, gold with very few particles, it smells nice and naturey but I couldn't taste anything! Nothing except a very slight sour pinch from tropic fruits and tiny bit of bitter. Interesting... For a beer that has ""Hop"" in the name I figured it'd be like most IPA's but this one is extremely unusual. I guess it's ok, goes down easy and has high ABV.

The head slowly settles to thick cap leaving the glass covered in lacing. The aroma dank and earthy predominantly with notes of citrus and pine underneath. The taste is more of the same with citrus and pine given the heavy hitting Simcoe punch over a pleasant light malt body. Heavily bitter throughout (no surprise). The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a dry finish. Overall, very good, but not in my taste preference. I'm not a big Simcoe fan and it dominates this beer IMO. Still very well made and a nice reminder of this beer blowing my mind years ago.",4.06

Surprised at the large malt bill, hops get washed away too quickly by a malt rush. (Uneven?) Feels well carbonated, medium body,finishes juicy. Overall if it did not have such an edge the malt bill could be reduced in my opinion. Seems the added malt was necessary because of the beer's astringency. Definitely get walloped by the hops.

Wisconsin Belgian Red,Friend of mine went to Wisconsin and brought this back. Poured into a snifter as recommended and immediately caught the whiff of the cherries. This followed with the sweet and tart flavor of cherry and some hint of the bitterness on the finish. Expected more of the oak like a Cabernet but none to be found. Overall a great beer for it's kind.,4.03
Wisconsin Belgian Red,"Pours a solid burgundy with a firm haze / fog to the transparency. Head is two fingers of fluffy off-white foam.

Aroma is big cherry with a ripe fleshy quality. Cherries lean mostly sweet, but possess a slight funky tartness at the back. The only other dominating note is red grape, which comes in at the mid-way point, lingering through the finish. It adds a jammy sweet note to the mix. Despite the listing of numerous sweet notes, the aroma remains well balanced, with a mild funky twist at the end. It's not a lactic sour, jaw tensing sourness, instead, a playful nudge back to balance.

Flavor profile is fresh cherry right out front. It's sweet, plump, and carries a very light funk to it. The back of the flavor profile is adorned by red grapes. The rest of the mix is green apple, pear, lemongrass, cellar stone, and herbal and medicinal hops. There is a twist of cough drop syrup cherry at the back, which is the detriment to each sip. It's lead with sweetness, which carries through the whole profile, being countered right at the end by a twang of funky sourness. It's not overtly sour though, acting just enough to tip the scale from sweet to balanced.

Mouth feel has a crisp texture adorned by a consistent, tight effervescence. It has a medium effervescence, neither hard, nor soft. Thickness is medium as well.

Overall, a delicious beer driven by cherries. It remains remarkably well balanced, despite leaning on the sweet fruit of cherry to flavor it.

The cherry notes are balanced by a very light but noticeable sourness; the cherries themselves aren't overly tart, but combined with the mild sourness of the beer, it creates a lovely overall experience. Additional tasting notes of oak and vanilla.

Taste: Tart cherry perfectly balanced with sweet malt and a mildly bitter finish that complements the whole thing. Some additional fruity esters noted in all of this.

Wisconsin Belgian Red,"Review 1499

I have wanted to try this beer for quite some time now. I finally have the chance to try this beer, thank you, Jay, much appreciated. The beer is 40 degrees and served in a tulip glass. The pour of the beer created a two-fingered pinkish tint with good retention. I was not expecting much retention in the head of the beer, this is a fruit beer. The beer having some retention is impressive, I have seen similar styles fall flat quickly. The head did not leave any lacing on the glass. The color of the beer is a dark reddish hue with a dark copper hue. This beer is clear, considering this is a fruit beer. I was expecting some sediment or something. It does not distract from the appearance. The overall appearance is above average.

The initial aromas in the beer are cherries, sugar syrup, and lightly toasted malts. Nosing further, I detect oak, malty sweetness, a touch of herbal, grassy, and a hint of floral. The aromas are cherry dominant, it is hard for me to pull any other aromas out.

The flavors in the beer are cherries, malts, grass, lightly toasted malts, oak, wheat, a note of earth, floral esters, a hint of phenols, and a note of pharmaceutical.

The mouthfeel is slightly tart and dry.

The body of the beer is medium, medium-light carbonation, and full finish.

Is this a beer? It is simply one awesome beer. The fruit flavors are bright and vibrant. The malt and wheat are subtle but there and the oak finishes the beer perfectly. I wish I had many more in the fridge.",4.79
Wisconsin Belgian Red,"Nice rich red that's got some brown to it. Dirty head that sticks to the sides, before retreating to swirl and ring.

Nose is boldly sweet cherries. Candied cherries. It's just straight candied cherries. Maybe a hint of spices (clove, cinnamon), but through and through this is sweet sweet cherries. Not quite maraschino, but almost. The missus loves it. It's sweeter than I was anticipating, almost sickly so, and I think sweeter than I'd like.

Thankfully it's not quite as sweet tasting as it smells. I think my mis-expectations were driven by the 'belgian red' aspect of the name, so I was thinking something significantly more sour. There's a definite tartness to the taste, but even then I wouldn't call it sour, and it doesn't match up with my limited experience with belgian reds (flanders style). But I am drilling into the wrong things here.
The flavour is a pleasant blend of the sweetness from the cherries and a nice tart finish that actually has elements of tart cherries/tart cherry juice, which I enjoy quite a bit. Also a lot of 'red' flavour a la fruit punch, but again, thankfully not as cloyingly sweet.

As stated, it's got some tart acidity, and some bright effervescence, but is otherwise very smoothe.

This is a masterfully put together beer. I can see why it gets the love it does. It doesn't happen to match straight up with my personal preferences, especially when it comes to cherries (and primarily on the nose), but I can see why people love it, and it is undeniably very well put together.

Look - Thick motor oil black, with a beautiful milk chocolate brown half finger head. The lacing on this beer is thick, top notch.

Smell - A wonderful whisky up front, with notes of vanilla and espresso and some chocolate

Taste - A nice roasted espresso with hints of chocolate and vanilla. A suprising bitterness likely accentuated by the espresso beans helps cut the maltiness. As it warms, the espresso really comes through and takes center stage, almost too much.

Feel - This is a thick and chewy beer, definitely a nice slow sipper.

Overall - This is a good strong stout. Pretty standard in terms of big bold flavor, however I felt the bitterness was a bit too prevalent as this stout warmed. It would have been a bit more agreeable if was slightly sweeter. Still very enjoyable, no doubt.",3.74

Negra Modelo,"Poured from a 12oz bottle best by Nov 2022

On the pour a 2 finger head forms, which gradually recedes to a thin covering over the top of the beer. Color is a dark brown/copper to amber. Very lively carbonation. Some lacing tries to form but not the best.

Aroma is mostly oxidized lager yeast with some extra malts in from traditional modelo. Some dark notes but no real malt sweetness comes through. Maybe some very very light mexican hops similar to corona but less light struck. Not a lot here.

Taste is more complex than the aroma. Lager feel right at the front of the sip with a slow evolution to a fuller bodied malty flavor with very fleeting and light bitterness. Not really a bitter beer, but not completely hopless. Aftertaste is subtle dark toffee malt, still penetrated by some mexican lager yeast flavors and it slowly fades out to a more bready note.

Feel is light for the style but not a watery beer. Head still gives a good amount of mouthfeel but it's on the lighter side of things. Similar to modelo maybe a bit bigger.

Overall for the brand a decent dark lager but for the style a bit disappointing and overridden by generic lager flavors, especially when drinking from the bottle. Not a bad beer by any means but not a great example of a Dunkel. It was my Cinco de mayo beer since I wanted something more than generic Mexican mass market lager.",3.31

Negra Modelo,"355 mL bottle from a six-pack bought at the LCBO; dated Nov 26 2021 and served barely chilled. One of a dwindling number of widespread macro lagers that I haven't gotten around to reviewing for one reason or another.

Pours a clear copper-amber colour with some effervescence; gathered atop is an inch of soapy, lumpy, cream-coloured head that dissipates within a couple of minutes. It leaves behind a messy coat of lacing, in addition to a sudsy collar and filmy cap - looks good to me. Subtle aroma of caramelized sugars, with toasted grains and bread; maybe a teensy bit of nuttiness and some metallicity.

It's a serviceable dark lager: a little sweet, but nothing unusual for the style. Toasted grains and lightly caramelized sugars, with doughy sweetness on the back end; just a hint of grassy, herbal hop bitterness on the back end for balance. The aftertaste is slightly sweet and nutty, fading within a moment or so. Medium-light in body, with moderate carbonation that gently prickles the tongue; smooth mouthfeel, not much bite. Fantastic drinkability - I don't tend to consume dark lagers in large quantities, but six of these around a campfire wouldn't present much of an obstacle.

Final Grade: 3.42, a B-. For a Euro-style dark lager, Negra Modelo is average at best - but I can't rightly claim that it was unpalatable, or that there was anything especially wrong with it. If anything, it's one of the better macro lagers I've had in recent years, and easily the best Mexican macro I've tried to date. The main downsides (at least here in Ontario) are the format and price point - in fact, my unwillingness to pay $14-16 for six bottles of macro lager is the biggest reason I've avoided reviewing this until now. I still don't think it's worth that, but the beer itself is nice enough, and worth the tick.",3.42

Negra Modelo,"Bottle served with a lime at fiesta Mexican a in moab , utah

Notes: Negra Modelo, better known as ""the cream of the beer"", is a Munich-type beer with 5.3º of alcohol that offers a balanced flavor and a delicate aroma of dark malt, caramel and hops.

Today it occupies the first place in sales among dark beers in Mexico. This beer is accompanied by a bright deep amber color, which is adorned with abundant, white and compact foam.

Negra Modelo was introduced in Mexico in 1925 as the dark beer called Modelo, to begin its great tradition. In 2014 it changed its image to a more sophisticated bottle but with the same content.

Ingredients - Water, barley malt, non-malted cereals, hops

Goes well with Mexican food, malty , fresh clean,

Good beer",3.75
Negra Modelo,"Overall:

People rating this in terms of depth and complexity are missing the point. This is right up there with Yuengling as a widely available, cheap, and easily down-able beer to go with food or just to kill several of without hurting your wallet. Great for the price, solid Vienna lager with macro-availability, easy go to choice when there are limited options.",3.8

75 Minute IPA,"Clear, bright amber coloring, beautiful bone white head, lasting long, looking lovely.

Aroma: Ah! Citrus and pine aplenty. Gorgeous. A little tropical fruit, melon and pineapple in this nose. Orange and lime, too. Ah, I say again.

Taste: Boom! Just what we want from an IPA, but creamy and smooth and just delightful. Bittersweet notes blast the palate, followed by malty sweetness. None too caustic, this IPA, it's smooth and palatable as can be.

I peeked at the label. Maple syrup? Not getting that yet. Huh.

Hop bitterness is restrained, but enjoyable. Delicious. Tasty. I'm loving it. I'm liking this so much, it's time to find out more about it. Okay, so….""A bottle conditioned India Pale Ale with maple syrup."" 7.5% ABV. There are some situations when 90 is too much. There are other situations when 60 is too little. There are many situations when 75 is just right. Bottle-conditioned with pure maple syrup for complexity and dry-hopped out the bejeezum boards.""",4.1
75 Minute IPA,"12oz bottle. Unfortunately I did not check the bottling date, which is '10/29/19', which makes the beer about eleven months in the bottle. I picked this up out of the store's cooler, and didn't think I needed to date check. Anyways . . .
Cloudy, deep gold colored body. One finger of lingering white, pillowy head. Not much left on the glass for lacing.
Aroma is grassy and muddy hops, with a sweet note from the maple syrup. Solid malt background.
Taste is grassy and piney hops, with a sweet note. Approaching a bitter note but not quite. Smooth trail off into the after taste. Allowing the beer to sit on the tongue really brings out the maple and hop combination.
Mouth feel is the best attribute of the beer, with dense coating and filling of the mouth. Very good carbonation.
I will try to try this again with a younger bottling date, but this is still a very good hoppy, but sweet, concoction.",4.14
75 Minute IPA,"I got a bottle of this beer off the single shelf at a beer store in LaCrosse, WI whilst there to move my daughter into school. The beer poured a clear golden with thin white head that is leaving a nice lace. The scent was mild hop notes.

S: Aromas of caramel, pink grapefruit to orange, and pine in glorious balance.
T: Sweet. Flavors follow the nose, but seems complex in its simplicity. Solid, but not overpowering, i.e balanced bitterness.
M: Medium bodied with very robust carbonation. Smooth and easy drinking.

75 Minute IPA,"Poured from a bottle into a shaker pint. Purchased at Trader Joe’s.

Look: Transparent with some light chill haze. Thick white head. Color is a light caramel.

Smell: Very malt forward with a bitter floral hop bit. Like whole wheat bread. Some toffee notes. No maple to be found.

Taste: Big and malty up front. Then a huge citric and floral hop bite comes in to the body with that distinct dogfish head IPA yeast. I’m not getting any maple here either.

Feel: Too big for 7.5%. High bitterness and sweetness that do not cancel each other out. Good carbonation.

Overall: The maple isn’t there and the IPA is not good enough on its own. I feel like if the maple rich sweetness was there it would help but instead the whole equation gets thrown off with that one missing part. Just okay.",2.95

$2.99 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy golden-orange body beneath a full head of off-white foam. The head retention appears to be pretty good. The aroma is grainy/malty with just a touch of maple syrup, and citrusy, piney, and floral with what I'm guessing are Cascades and/or some other ""C hops"". Hehe, I just looked at the label and it reads ""off-centered art series FEATURING DAN STILES"" - he's a friend of mine. Moving on, the flavor is fuller than the aroma might lead you to believe but it's pretty much the same. It's grainy, bready, and a little honeyish and sweet on the front of the tongue, but the hops and maple syrup immediately step in and transform it. The hops are gently citrusy, leafy, herbal, piney, and spicy. The leafy and herbal qualities enhance the malt & maple syrup while the citrus, pine, and spice lend it contrast and an additional balance beyond the bitterness that's there. It's medium-full in the mouth with a delicate bristle of carbonation before warming to become smooth and creamy. It's an interesting beer. It's pretty big (how strong is it? 7.5%) and a bit sweet but it's completely balanced. It transitions from malty to malty & hoppy, and then finishes drier but not too bitter with just a spritz of alcohol helping out the hops. I drank that REAL quick and I certainly didn't intend to. I've got just a swig and small sip left. The only thing that's let me down ever so slightly is that the lacing wasn't better. It still scores a 4.25 out of 5 though!

Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"It is a beautiful pour from a tap into a clear pint glass. Dark copper-amber in color, it also brings with it a modest and enduring light biege head. It's mildly aromatic, with solid earthy and malty notes. That also describes the flavor, which is malty enough to provide a little sweetness and a decent body. The hops add flavor without being overly bitter. This is truly a wet hopped IPA. Earthy throughout the drinking experience, even the finish doesn’t approach the expected IPA hoppy dryness. Not that this lacks a good bitter hop inclusion, it's there, just well balanced by a really good malt body.",4.43
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"Look... brown, brown, brown, copper and with ample carbonation and a white head. transparent
Smell...nonexistent light hop citrus with some maltiness
Taste...Resinous , slick, peppery but none of the kind of fresh hop experience that lagunitas has with their wet hop. Good but for me very reminiscent of celebration in taste and color.
Feel...a carbonation that dictates the bitterness in the back end very nice. much lacing
Overall...This is a nice beer but get a lot of the same notes from Celebration fresh hop and there are many sierra beverages i like a little more... they are a victim of all of their previous successes.
Its good why not try it!!!",3.76
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"355 ml bottle, vintage 2015, in Nevada City. Amber to copper colour, large white head. Pleasant aroma of fresh hops, herbal and fruity notes.

Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"Sierra Nevada came through with just what the beer Dr. ordered for my jangled nerves. I wholly appreciate how this dank herbal brew is kind of the opposite of so many IPAs on the scene here in the PNW. It has a pretty substantial caramel malty backbone that is distinctive like Rueben’s but less marmalade. The sweetness is mellowed by the bitterness, but it’s not too resinous, thick, but far from watery either. Somehow, this ABV is perfect for a nice buzz but way more sessionable than many IPAs out, maybe that’s a good thing if your planning a hangout outside with your buds. This herbal/malt profile also seems more aligned with this winter season so there’s another positive point. I did get this on tap so I’m not sure if I’d appreciate this as much if it sat around for more than a month and several weeks in the shelves. At this price, it would be hard to pass if I was looking to purchase a pony keg for the man cave",4.19
Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"This one smells extremely bright and hoppy. It has no trace of malts in the smell.

The taste starts out with a citrussy and dank hoppiness.  Soon after it all turns very beery with a ton of sweet malts balancing everything out.

It feels foamy and smooth in my mouth. It leaves behind a lush and bitter aftertaste.

Overall it's a really good IPA.  It's got a similar taste to other Sierra Nevada IPAs but there's something more full about it. I give it a 4.7 out of 6.",3.99

Northern Hemisphere Harvest Wet Hop IPA,"Look: Semi-clear dark reddish amber with a huge off-white head that billows and holds at two fingers, slowly receding and leaving sticky lacing behind
Aroma: Cut grass, rose petals, grapefruit-led citrus notes, floral hops, and bready, rich malt
Taste: Grassiness, a huge flower bouquet, and sharp citrus come crashing in on the palate followed by rose and an awesome, doughy (almost sourdough), bready malt base that tries to keep the hops tethered. Good clean hop bite on the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied but not chewy at all and lighter than both the look and taste would lead me to believe, medium-high carbonation, clean, and mild dryness on the finish
Overall: This is delicious. As both a Sierra Nevada and fresh hop fan, this is an easy one to get behind but it is really tasty and obviously well-made. The wet Centennial hops are very prominent in the taste and aroma (flowers, citrus, grass, and rose) but this beer’s delicious malt base is equally tasty and apparent, even in a beer meant to showcase hops. Reminds me of a fresh hop Celebration Ale but I can tell it’s a fresh hop plus the malt profile is not only different tasting but lighter than Celebration. Outstanding and recommended",4.43

Pure Hoppiness,"This is a big, classic West Coast double IPA and it’s one of the best specimens of that species. Juicy, piney, and full bodied while achieving a dry finish.

Smells of huge hops but not one fruity flavor stands out. Usually doubles don’t have as much hop scent due to all the maltiness, but this thing is “mega” hopped—dry hopped big time I bet. I get sweet malty orange spicy hops. Wow.

On the tongue piney, orange zest hops and cracker bread and toasted malts. Finishes fairly dry despite the thick, wet feel it hits you with.

It’s big, it’s flavorful and it’s pretty amazing.

I loved this review by a real pro and amend mine with it:

By: Tracy Hensley lJudges Rating:

Overall Impression:
18 / 20

A consistent aroma blend of clean pine resin, pineapple syrup, freshly ripped mint and cracked black pepper lead the way in the front of the nose. From 8 inches away, Tahitian vanilla bean pods, baked whole wheat bread, low sulfur notes and white grape-like fruitiness also appear. The white head does not persist but does create a fine foam above a slightly hazy, golden appearance. Flavors start as intense dank pine extract and continues into the aftertaste where it is accompanied by sweetened white bread, which keeps the bitterness in check with a moderate, throat-coating alcoholic warmth. The second sip showcases tropical mango juice before pine again dominates as noticeable alcohol warmth and low motor oil elements come through. Full body and full fat creaminess coats the mouth, and the medium-high carbonation and moderate hop mouthfeel close out the finish while alcohol tingles on the lips.“",4.21
Pure Hoppiness,"[Original rating 2015-11-19] Bottle. Pours clear dark gold with a thin white head. Aroma is a little citrus, alcohol, grass, malt. Taste is super hoppy, resiny, bitter but with just enough malt to balance it out. Nice thick mouth feel.",3.88
Pure Hoppiness,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Dogfish Head tulip. No freshness date.

L: Nearly clear light golden amber pour. Fluffy white head leaves solid lacing.

S: Pine and caramel malts. Sweet and hoppy.

T/F: Malts up front... caramel and toasted grains. Pine and citrus rind hop profile. A bit of spice. West Coast style... good bitterness for balance. Medium bodied... sticky on the tongue.

O: A decent West Coast DIPA... may not have been at its freshest, so could be even better right out of the gate. One I'd enjoy having again.",3.75
Pure Hoppiness,"Not sure how fresh this is, as it was on the discount shelf. Pours a clear amber honey with a thick white head that recedes to a thin cap and leaves great lacing. Aroma is orange rind and pine. Flavor is sweet citrusy fruits followed by a bitter pine with some caramel malts in the mix. Feel is a bit heavy but overall a very nice brew. I'd like to try this fresh and/or on tap.",4.34
Pure Hoppiness,Poured a deep gold leaning toward orange rather than amber. Aroma hits you with exactly what the name told you to expect. Hops hops and more hops.

Dec 30, ‘20 bottling date - 6 months old.
Much more like an English brown porter (aside from the bitterness) than most American porters. Roasty notes are low in favor of nutty, bready malts.
There’s also a thread of that Chico yeastiness throughout.
What saves it is the body: light and fizzy enough to be sessionable, but with a creaminess that makes it satisfying.

A solid beer, but get Edmund Fitzgerald for that classic American Porter profile.

Lighter, fizzier, sweeter, nuttier, more balanced, less hoppy, cleaner, and more sessionable than Sierra Nevada Stout.",3.83
Porter,"12 oz. bottle dated 6/18/20

Clear, translucent brown ale with two fingers fine tan head. Full head and lacing.
Roast malt, gingerbread, earthy yeast aromas explode out of the bottle.
Nutty sweet roast malt, light hop kick, light char, coffee flavors, deepening as the glass warms. A yeast flavor that I seem to experience in a number of Sierra Nevada beers.
Light hop bitterness, medium feel, lasting carbonation
Substantial depth of flavors in a 5 % ABV ale. Very pleasant.",3.89
Porter,"Nice roasty malt up front with some sweet earthiness mixed in. It has a light mouthfeel with lots of carbonation and a mild bitter end. The finish drops off quickly - too quickly actually. It really is a nice porter, but overall it's too light, could be so much more.",3.71
Porter,"Pours a dark coffee brown, ruby hues and a creamy tan head. Aromas are fairly muted, a roasted malt profile is there but I can’t really pick anything definitive. Flavors include roasty malt notes of coffee, raw cocoa and earthy nuttiness. Trademark SN floral hop bite makes a subtle appearance on the back end. Mild carbonation. Lingering bitterness on the palate.

It’s good for sure, not extraordinary or anything. As with any beer, freshness is everything. I would love to get some of this closer to the source to see the contrast in the flavors.",3.47
Porter,"Had this one in a blind taste test recently with 3 other porters and it just did not stack up. The look was different, the carbonation was different, the taste was bland in comparison. Not as good as I remembered.",3.21
Porter,"Look: Dark brown, almost black on the pour and deep ruby-red when held to light, with a frothy light tan head that settles slowly, leaving good lacing
Aroma: Roasted barley, chocolate notes, toasted nuts, warm brown bread, and some earthiness
Taste: Roast is the highlighted theme here. Tons of roasted barley, nuttiness, and even a light roasted coffee bean note hit hard up front and as those begin to subside, chocolate joins the mix. More roast goodness and earthy notes take hold and lead to the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, smooth, medium-high carbonation, and smooth but slightly sharp on the finish from either the earthy hops or strong roast notes
Overall: This is tasty stuff. I hadn’t had this beer in almost two years as only one spot close to me has it in so when I saw bottles dated 10/9/20, I had to revisit and glad I did. A very well-made American porter with deep and rich malt flavors and enough earthy hops to keep it balanced. Throw in the very full body on this as well and you have yourself a winner. A classic and delicious to boot",4.1
Porter,"A - Normal pour into chalice producing a dark colored, translucent brew sporting a small 1/8"" inch quickly dissipating head. Low carbonation. Some lacing.

S - Yeast, malt, dark chocolate, and coffee notes. Licorice.

T - Coffee, cream, lactose, some chocolate notes. The aftertaste tends to linger and has an abrasive lactose quality.

M - Thin, relatively clean, somewhat refreshing.

D - This brew has many of the qualities of a milk stout without the robust body. All in all, this is not a bad brew. However, as far as styles are concerned, I feel this brew is a little mixed up.",3.2
Porter,"A truly pleasant classic right here.
Surprisingly dark black beer with a moderate off white head. Smells vaguely sweet and grainy with a touch of coffee and a touch of cola.
Taste follows with a sweet rich maltiness and a bit of cola on the edge.
Light and pleasant on the palate.
A wonderfully flavorful brew and a simple joy to drink",4.09
Porter,"Expectedly dark. Quickly dissipating head, no lacing. Aromas of coffee & chocolate. Taste is not as robust as most other porters, mildly bitter. Mouthfeel is smooth. Aftertaste slightly bitter. This would be a non offensive Porter for those wishing to explore this style.",3.94
Porter,"Not boozy.

Almost syrupy but not strong.

Good with a meal or food but not necessarily a stand alone beer.
Body is neither weak nor strong; aftertaste much the same.

Mediocre but not bad.",3.27
Porter,"Had this on draft 11/15/19 @ the Beer Temple.

A bit hoppy, but overall a well-crafted take on a classic style. Definitely a true American porter...I'd prefer it a bit maltier but this was very enjoyable.",4.03
Porter,Not a typical porter. Pours dark. Odd smell. A very mild clean body. Slight roasted malt finish. Smooth. The malt could be more pronounced. It's good but not typical for the style.,3.79
Porter,"I consume my share of porters in the fall and winter and this one is pretty good, though it lacks greatness. One flaw is that it is a little thin mouthfeel for a porter. The taste is solid, but the roasted malt is not as prominent as it is in some other porters that I prefer. It's solid, but I can usually do better in the style.",3.85
Porter,Pours up beautifully dark with a thick two-finger tan collar. Nice balance between malt and hops--tastes similar to Sierra Nevada Stout--just slightly less hops coming through. Overall very good.,3.79
Loose Cannon,"Clear, deep amber body under a large white head that left good lacing. Aroma of floral hops standing out against a backdrop of barley. Floral, herbal, piney hops remain the focus of the flavor. Malts add balance without being a distraction. Some spiciness in the aftertaste. Clean, dry pleasantly bitter mouthfeel. A locally made favorite.",4.19
Loose Cannon,"12oz can, tulip, best by 9/19/21.

Reddish copper with a creamy off-white head.

Watery citrus and caramel malt.

It’s all caramel malt and orange peel. Some orange liqueur as it warms.

Medium-light body with big bubbles that make it feel like a sparkling water.

Even being lenient for the past best by, this falls a bit flat.",3.31
Loose Cannon,"Loose Cannon has a thick, soapy, white head and a translucent, bubbly, orange appearance, with some glass lacing. The aroma is of faint, white bread crust and a touch of caramel. The flavor is of white bread crust, some caramel, and moderate bitterness. Loose Cannon has a medium body and a mostly-dry finish.

RJT",4.35
Loose Cannon,"A damn good IPA, full flavored, hoppy but not harsh or bitter, smooth-tasting, in fact, good mouth feel, nice lingering finish, attractive head and lacing. Highly drinkable.",4.34
Loose Cannon,"Pours a clear amber with thick, fluffy head and lots of lacing.

Smell is fruity and piney with notes of grapefruit, lemon peel and hints of caramel and dank melon.

Taste is fruity and a bit dnk. Notes of pine, grapefuit, lemonade and peach with a solid bitterness. Hints of caramel and earthiness on the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium, well carbonated.

Overall, a really nice, balanced IPA.",4.27
Loose Cannon,"I first tasted this beer many years ago, at least five or six. I had it from the bottle and thought it was good for sure, so I don't know why I never rated it. And I've never particularly bought the beer, but now we just had a growler of it which we purchased at State Line Liquors, Elkton,Maryland. Well, ON TAP,this is an excellent straightahead IPA! Rich amber color, a fantastic head, and full hoppy flavor but with lots of malt to balance it out! Will have to go back and try the bottles again soon.",4.5
Loose Cannon,"Crystal clear copper with an off white head. Good retention, though no lacing.

Smells like pine sap, pine bark, grapefruit peel, crystal malt, alcohol warmth, pink peppercorn.

Tastes like pine cone, grapefruit peel, ruby red grapefruit flesh, caramel, toasted bread, and lemon zest. Intense pine, a kiss of sweetness, some sweet citrus, and then a biting bitter finish. Very bitter initially, but it does not linger too long.

Medium feel, moderate carbonation, some sticky hop resin sticks on the tongue with the bitterness momentarily, but it does not linger for too long.",3.88
Hopsecutioner,"12 oz can into a tumbler.
Sudsy foam. No lace. Smells nice and fruity and hoppy. Taste is just average IPA, at best. Feels a little weak.
Overall, chicken wing wash, after work refresher, just something in the glass, I guess.,",3.56
Hopsecutioner,Got this as a single from the local beer store. Poured it into a clear glass beer mug. Color was a slightly dark gold and the smell was similar to that of a SN Torpedo. Taste was decent and I'd drink it again.,3.7
Hopsecutioner,"En World of the Seas (Flymaker's bar), en La Spezia. Tras excursión a Florencia. De Barril. Espuma eterna, sensación en boca suave y perfil de lúpulo resinoso amargo pero amable. Adictiva, anima a trago más largo de lo recomendable",4.29
Hopsecutioner,It pours a unique copper with good lacing the smell is kind of misleading with strong notes of grapefruit the taste is mostly pine with not much bitterness not a favorite but overall not bad for something different every once in a while,3.67
Hopsecutioner,"Whatever that ails ya, ya know? Whatever that ails ya. And like a lolly pop after the doctor checked you for rabies, Hopsecutioner does Raul well and good. I may not dream of it, but in this waking life I will gladly take it.

Honestly is key, my children.",4.0
Hopsecutioner,On tap ATL airport. Mostly clear deep orange/gold with short white head leaving scattered lacing in the 20 oz plastic cup. Nose is citrus and sweet malt. Taste follows with more malt and earthy hop notes. Not much bitterness. Doesn't do the name justice.,3.74
Hopsecutioner,"Appearance: Pours a light to medium, clear, golden color with a moderate white head. SRM of 7-8. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of earthy and dank orange, tangerine marmalade, with some earthy and biscuit malt notes underneath.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of spice citrus, orange, resinous tangerine with a pine soap finish. Mild bitterness, and leans sweet

Feel: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation. Finish is sweet and slightly flat (3.50)

Compared to Sierra Nevada's Torpedo IPA 1/21/22: Pours a lighter color with a milder head. Stronger aromas. More orange, tangerine. Less caramel and spice. A smaller body.

Overall: This one has resinous flavors of orange, tangerine, with somewhat of a soapy/chewy finish. Maybe some hop burn. I think it could use more carbonation. (Final Rating: 3.52)",3.52
Hopsecutioner,On tap at Terrapin in Athens. Pours a copper color with a slight head. Not the hops bomb I was expecting. Definitely a combination of grapefruit and pine with the pine winning. But not over the top.,3.92
Hopsecutioner,"Clear light copper, thick white head, great retention, chunky swaths of lace. Very pretty
Old school west coast aroma: grapefruit, pine, a bit of dank, and caramel
Taste follows aroma for the most part, there's a little bit of tropical fruit mixed in as well.
Medium bodied and appropriately carbonated. A little bit sticky
Man, I miss these type of IPA",4.33
Arctic Panzer Wolf,Sixteen ounce four pack copped from Buy Rite in South Orange. Pours a ruddy copper hue with moderate frothing. Very assertive aroma replete with strong notes of white grape and marmalade. Powerful flavors present which burst forth with ridiculous amounts of citrus-laden chewiness. Good stuff. Highly recommended.,4.95
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"A: Two plus finger building head is towering in the chalice, a creamy soft and billowy composition that is light tan in color overlays a darken tangerine color for the body. Bubbly and soapy lace ring. Hazy and dark appearance is dense and shows some macro-carbonation bubbles clinging to the vessel walls. A strong steady stream has a pretty good lasting presence of effervesce.

S: Sweetened grapefruit pulp is juicy and semi-tart along with wet grassy hop notes. Dried peaches and apricot fruit has side notes of orange-citrus upon the close with some mixed fruit presence. Good strength overall, complexity is only moderate.

T: Dank tangerine-grapefruit flavor provides a bittering first bite with a flowery edge. Big grassy dry hopping soon moves in. A touch of soapy hopping is every so slight. Resiny with a flowery bite of hops that really packs a wallop.

M: Resiny mouthful, with a follow of dry flowery lacing on the tongue. Very bitter on the hold. Small carbonation factor that really does not make nor break it either way.

O: Overall 3 Floyds makes some trueley outstanding beers that stand above the rest, unfortunately this is a mere placeholder in terms of the brewery's other accords. While solid in strength with a demanding flowery hop bitterness, I just did not find it contained a lot of complexity or malt attributes. The blunt force of hops most likely drowned out any small and subtle secondary contributions. A very bittering overlay of hops that would surely create entertainment on the noob hop drinker, but comes short in a complete aspect for me for outstanding regards.",3.75
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"(16 oz can, PKGD 12/28/20; purchased 4-pk off shelf... poured into a snifter, but snuck two sips from the can after the abbreviated pour)

L: I am all about head and this is one of the most amazing foam stands I've ever seen - Ramos fizz level - up and over the lip of the glass; rigid, turgid, tense... the amber liquid is grody-hazy and cumulus-cloudy... but huh what alright... little lace; ancient can???

S: grapefruit powder, laundry detergent (spring scent), orange gojo hand cream... a bit of orange spice (Tazo) and perfumy ethanol... arguably lacking a spicy zip (4.375)

T: malt muck, hop hullabaloo; bulbous expressions all around... lingering creamsicle and low-fi Earl Grey elements... SN-esque hop balance... citrus leather, malty orange, piney greenery... piney, orange-pithy ping persists...

F: wafty waifish wispiness, despite the hefty heart-hearthy hedonic homey hum... mellow, pithy tang pinging out front of a ghostly pulse... I'm lost for words; put me to sleep

I may need to return to the undisclosed bunker in which I found this and negotiate some more, ooh baby... I'm not I recall the last time I met such a sipper (1741)",4.49
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"This was another beer that I picked up recently at the Whole Foods in Williamsburg. Always enjoyed 3 Floyds as it’s nice to see them available in this neck of the woods again! This was a clear winner as it had plenty going for it as it fit it's ""massive IPA"" description quite nicely, down to the last sip!

The look and feel to this was reminiscent of West Coast beers as it had a gorgeous copper hue to it with a fine haze and a bit of dark sediment floating around in it. Plenty of head topped it off as the lacing was deep, extensive, and beautifully layered all the way down the side of my pint glass. Loads of pine, resin, and grapefruit in the nose along with a bit of Caramel Malt as the taste nicely followed suit. Lots of floral notes that felt like Anchor emerged in the notes as this warmed up with a nice resinous body underneath that. The back had a ton of grapefruit and lemon zest to go along with some sweet malt that almost called for a chaser of water to finish this off, except I wanted the flavor to last as long as possible!

The carbonation was softly moderate and the body was balanced as the booze was not that noticeable. Loved the label on this can as this had a packaging dated of 12/28 on the bottom of the can. Aside from that being barely legible, this was a lovable beast of a beer that easily deserved another go-around. Who knew that one of the best left coast beers came out of Indiana?",4.37
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"Canned 12/28/20

And we're back with another imperial IPA from 3 Floyds. I loved their Permanent Funeral, and I'm hoping that this is in a similar vein. Regardless, I'm always on the lookout for new beers from them ever since they started distributing here in Mass. Let's dive right in

Pours a cloudy golden amber with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a cap and leaves decent lacing

On first whiff, this is a promising beer. It's big and in your face while also being balanced. I'm picking up on aromas of rich caramel, bready malt, juicy orange, resiny hops, apricot, and a touch of honey

There's less of a delicate balance in the taste, but it's still good for what it is. On the front end of the sip the malt dominates and I'm tasting caramel, soft bread, lightly floral hops, and a touch of lemon zest. The swallow bitters up a bit, bringing notes of pithy grapefruit, orange marmalade, fresh pine, herbal hops, and light bready malt

A medium body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a smooth and silky beer. Finishes mostly dry with a hint of warming alcohol

This was very good, but I've had much better from them. Still, I would get it again in a heartbeat if it was my only 3F choice",4.21
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"a: slightly murky dark copper color with a nice 3 finger frothy tan head

s: mango and pineapple with loads of sweet caramel and strawberry upfront. kiwi, passionfruit, and peach. candied apricots and tangerine. crackers and a touch of honey. faint grapefruit and a little bit of grass

t: sweet caramel and strawberries. pineapple and a lot of peach. peach cobbler, orange sorbet, and a nice piney bitterness. sweet melons and honeydew. grass and grapefruit towards the end. little bit of a bready malt backbone. nice hit of bitterness at the very end

m: full mouthfeel, slightly sticky. low-medium carbonation

o: a bit mellow in the flavor with a big hit of bitterness. malts are definitely noticeable, but the bitterness overrides. hops aren't too diversified, but this is a old school DIPA for sure, with more bitterness than i would have thought for a DIPA. Good, not great IMO",4.0
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"Pours a hazy golden tangerine with two big fingers of head and a plethora of floaties. The nose has pine and earthy notes. The flavor is pithy with a touch of citrus that is present but way in the back. The finish starts off bitter and gets more so as one moves down the glass.

If you like candied IPAs, this ain't the beer for you!",4.38
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"helluva beer, man, helluva beer. it's a hop monster - if that's not your style, you've been warned. If that *is* your style, you've been warned.
L: from the can. The can is, as it proclaims, ""not normal"".
S: basically all pine. mine might be a bit too cold. i'll note if more emerges as it warms.
T: big grapefruit hop bomb with a few floral notes. Not for the faint of heart. 3F goes big, not home.
F: smooth, rich, drying, and more bitter!
O: hey, it works for me, what can i say!?",4.54
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"Beautiful deep amber with a tall, rocky, pale doeskin head with everlasting gobstopper like retention. Rim to liquid lace drapes the glass, the nearly red-amber beer is opaque with protein haze but not flocked with suspended oat starch.
The aroma is malt - rich and sweet followed quickly by sugar dusted tangerines and honey dipped pine cones. Yummy jam on toast smells welcome the nose and entice it in for deeper snuffs. The hops could be louder but then the lovely malt would be lost. 3F's knows what they're doing.
The taste is again malt up front with a rush of hop flavors and bitterness on it's heals. More honey notes coat the tongue and help soften the barrage of hop flavors and bitter bite. Fruity flavors of pear and grapefruit mix with the spruce and pine needles and green grass notes all smothered in that honey - caramel malt sweetness in balanced complexity achieved by only the best of brewers.
The malt liquor aspect comes through at the finish which is dry and warming with a nice lingering alcohol and hop aftertaste. The priming sugar addition detracts from the overall mouth feel maybe and only offers tasteless alcohol to the mix.
The body is shy of full and the alcohol hides as I said , till the very end. A bit over dry on the back end.
Highly drinkable, superbly balanced at least up front and, in the end, extremely satisfying.",4.41
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"Canned 5 weeks ago.

L -- Slightly hazy copper body in the glass with two fingers of rocky off-white head produced with moderate pour. Decent retention and minimal lacing
S -- Dried pine, woodsy earthiness, booze, caramel, herbal bitters, hint of copper

Arctic Panzer Wolf,"16oz can into a pint glass. Canned 12/28/20, so 5-6 weeks old.

Actual hazy burnt orange/marmalade colored body. Small bright white head shrinks to a ring and covering, leaving interesting lacing.

Lightly hoppy aroma.

On tasting, pretty aggressive beer. The malt sweetness is detectable, but merely serves as a platform for an all out (panzer) assault of bitter grapefruit and pine hops.

Mouth closer to full than medium, finish a slightly sweet strong grapefruit hit to the palate.

Overall, after an initial shock, this one really grew on me. Excellent old style DIPA. Happy to have another 3 in the fridge.",4.19
Arctic Panzer Wolf,"L: golden hue, somewhat hazy.
S: piney and stone fruit.
T: peach flows throughout the swallow.

Arctic Panzer Wolf,"Can purchased at One Stop Beer Shop in Greece, NY.

This one pours a light amber/dark orange color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells supremely resinous, with stone fruit, orange peel, piney hops, with an almost burnt aroma.

I've been wanting to try this one since basically 2014, and it's finally available to me locally. It's an uncompromising old school bruiser. The taste is placed firmly back into the IBU wars of yesteryear, with a bit piney/grassy/pithy biterness, with bitter grapefruit, orange peel, and some slightly compromising stone fruit/orange sweetness. A lot of people wouldn't like this in today's juice bomb day and age. To me, it's a really great look back in time, and it still holds up for me today.

This is a slow sipper due to the intense pithy bitterness here. As it warms, bitterness retreats slightly, with a bit more fruity hop character. There is nothing ""juicy"" about this one.

I was excited to hear this was one in town on shelves, and it's met my expectations from back in my old money days. This was a great West Coast style IPA.",4.56
Blackout Stout,"I love this beer period, from the dark rich color to its smooth mouth feel, It's one of my seasonal favorites. I went so far as to buy a sixtel and Put it on tap in my bar. It was then I found the fatal flaw. While me and all my friends were enjoying this if it became apparent that there was a 4 drink maximum, as anything beyond that seem to have everyone ready for a nap. That 9% is a bit heavy for more than light drinking. So while I still love it I'll enjoy it in smaller quantities.",4.5
Blackout Stout,"I loved the grape flavor at the beginning and how finishes into more or a cherry flavor inside the chocolate malt. I loved this beer and will probably get it any time I visit the tap room.

Blackout Stout,"On tap at airport for my breakfast. Absolutely tasty stuff, and unable to get any Great Lakes at home in NH. Would love to try again cellared. A tad on the bitter side with more hopping than I normally enjoy in this style, perhaps that mellows well with age.",3.99
Blackout Stout,"First poured into a sniffer than pint glass. This stout presents itself with a rich dark brown color and aged golden head.

Tastes of toasted malt and dark chocolate with a touch of sweetness. Smell gives off hints of black coffee but not too much else.

Blackout Stout,"From a 12oz bottle dated 5/13/20 into a pint glass.

Pours a somewhat thin opaque black with about a half finger of light brown head. Retention and lacing aren't much to speak of.

Smells of coffee and alcohol and a hint of sweetness.

Taste is coffee and dark chocolate. for 9.9% abv, the alcohol is fairly well hidden. Very pleasant tasting.

Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I would like for the style but the taste more than makes up for it. Generally easy drinking.

Overall, this is a pretty decent RIS. A little thin, but taste is rocking and price point is great. More, please! :)",4.09

Big aromas and flavors of dark roasted malt, with notes of molasses and dark fruit, a hint of espresso bean, and lots of char and roasty bitterness lingering on the palate. Silky smooth in body, sweet but not overly so. The alcohol is very well hidden. Enjoy-by date on this sample was 5/29/19, but still fabulous eight months later. This is the perfect complement for a wintry night. Prosit!",4.52
Blackout Stout,"Dark color with some light reddish hue on edges. Smooth smell and taste with a coffeeish presence. Light feel compared with other stouts. Finish was pleasant. Overall, tasted a bit too ""alcoholly"" for my liking, $10.99 + tax for a four pack.",3.16
Blackout Stout,"this is a serious stout. deep black on the pour with a smallish head. aroma is a mix of char and sweetness. flavor is more of the same with a bit of coffee, chocolate, fruit and bitterness. just delicious. the mouthfeel is very smooth and luxorious. the taste of the alcohol is there but overall this is just terrific.",4.36
Blackout Stout,"Pours out lighter than I maybe have ever seen for a stout of this nature. Highlights all the way throughout. I had low hopes because of this, but as I put my nose in and tasted it, it’s actually a pretty solid stout.

Beautiful roast mixing with unsweetened cocoa while remaining clean throughout the entirety. A little on the thin side for what it is, but not too thin by any means.",4.13
Blackout Stout,"Light carbonation with a slick,thick,creamy feel.
Aroma is roasted charred malt,wood,earthy, sweet malt, sweet black licorice
Taste is bitter charred malt on the finish and lingers. Licorice isnt as sweet as aroma suggests but very noticeable. Smokey,earthy,wood
Excellent complex,full flavored. Not usually a fan of licorice but was great here and the other flavors are so strong and bold that the licorice doesnt dominate",4.24

M: Light body, moderately lively carbonation.

O: Haven't had this one since it was first released, before I was on BA, so it's nice to get to try it again. Takes me back to when session IPAs were the new toy on the shelf. To its credit, this one is bright and crisp, and would definitely do the job as a lawnmower beer. That said, it does have a bit of the trademark session IPA watery-ness, and there are other session IPAs out there with a bit more balance and flavor.

Go To IPA,"Appearance: Lightly hazy, bright golden hue, slim white head.

Aroma: As advertised, very vibrant and utterly bursting with hops. Bold and bright citrus and pine. Ah, so nice.

Taste: More of that big, fierce and shining hop flavor, with just enough juicy malt below. Lean bodied, with a dominant buzz of hop bitterness. Drinkable, yes, also refreshing and tasty, too. It's good beer, and I can drink it, but…just doesn't thrill me. I really don't desire the session IPA. I like the regular ones just fine, thank you very much.

Go To IPA,"I was given this can by my cousin as a gift but since I have such a backlog here, it took me a while to get around to this. Canned on 10/26/17 with enjoy by date of 1/24/18 printed below it, I did not have this fresh but did keep it cold until I cracked it open today. It's been a while since I've had anything from Stone and although their IPA's were a big reason why I love that style so much now, this one was just a bit underwhelming to me...

The pour was decent as the liquid was golden, fairly translucent, and topped off with plenty of head. Only a few scattered sections of lacing were left behind once I took my first few sips. Tons of floral notes, citrus pith, dry lime, and smooth hops could be found in the nose but the overall appeal was that of a dry and earthy beer. That's exactly what this turned out to be once I sipped this as it felt much stronger than a session IPA and I needed a chaser of water to fully get this down. Some prickly pear cactus and pine emerged as this warmed up but the basic malt presence and grassy aftertaste weren't enough to put this over the top.

Regardless of the flavor profile, the lack of discernible alcohol made this somewhat easy to quaff and the slightly resinous aftertaste was a pleasant reminder that this was indeed an IPA and not a Pale Ale. Not really feeling this one but because of the age, it's hard to tell whether that was because of my inaction in getting around to this or the beer itself. If you're looking for a ""light' version of their flagship IPA, reach for this and please, consume it fresh!",3.75
Go To IPA,"The Go To IPA pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a big 1 finger rocky and soapy looking head that fades rather slowly. The smell is dank and hop forward from the Cascade hops, with hints of stone fruit, citrus and a lemon zest with grapefruit and floral notes, along with a bit of malt sweetness. Let’s see how it goes down…rather smooth across the palette with a medium mouthfeel. You get a nice dose of pithy citrus up front with some tropical fruits with a good pine bite. The sweet malt follows with a bit of prickly carbonation. As it finishes quite dry.",3.29
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Remember when you were a kid and poured chocolate syrup all over your pancakes at a restaurant? This is the beer equivalent: a nice mellow porter with a rich chocolatey taste, a little bit acidic toward the high end, but thankfully not too sweet and with a bassy bottom note almost like Italian roast coffee. In an age of brands committing suicide by cutting quality, Samuel Smith's has kept on providing one of the best beers out there, even if a bit pricy.",3.9
Organic Chocolate Stout,Incredible chocolate flavor. This is how a chocolate milkshake would taste if it were a beer. Great body and not overly cloying. Definitely worth a try.,4.74
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Phenominal beer. The texture is unbeatable in how bold and full bodied it is. Flavor actually retains some chocolate so it's not just in the name, smells like it too.",4.63
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Black to dark brown body. Quick flash of a brief, short beige head. Highly carbonated and tasty. A nice sipper, a bit of chocolate and smooth malts. The barley is more discernible than the chocolate, to make it clear where the focus is here. But it's well done. Usually when a beer gets to its last few sips it becomes less bearable, but all throughout this beer is of very solid quality and retains good flavor.",4.3
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Had this from a bottle.
A: pours a dark brown body with no real head; small lacing
S: smells like sweet tootsie roll pop; pretty good overall
T: sweet, chocolate milk tasting beer; milk chocolate tasting with a subtle, dry chocolate finish
M: medium body and pretty smooth; slightly filling
D: nice feel and taste combo; nice drinking sweet stout",3.82
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Bottle poured into a nonic

Brewers Notes: Brewed with well water (the original well, sunk in 1758, is still in use with the hard water is drawn from 85 feet underground), the gently roasted organic chocolate malt and real organic cocoa used in this ale impart a delicious, smooth and creamy character, with inviting deep flavours and a delightful finish - this is the perfect marriage of satisfying stout and luxurious chocolate that will lead to smiles and refills. Samuel Smith's brews in traditional coppers, uses stone 'Yorkshire Squares' for fermentation, and ships every bottle from the brewery with great pride.

Dark cola brown liquid topped by a two finger creamy taupe crown

Aroma is sweet milk chocolate

Taste is sweet milk chocolate with faint roast malts

Sweet, low sudsing , smooth

Good beer",4.25
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Poured from a 550 mL bottle into a Sierra Nevada Imperial Pint Glass

The beer pours completely pitch black with about two fingers of khaki/tan head that slowly recedes leaving behind a cap that lasts throughout the session, and a moderate amount of lacing

The aroma is overpoweringly chocolate! Once you get past the initial punch of chocolate there are notes of vanilla and roasted malt

The taste follows the nose quite closely. The milk chocolate is complimented with some notes of roasted malt. As the beer warms I start to get some coffee and vanilla. Medium/full bodied and velvety smooth. Lightly carbonated with a slightly dry finish.

Overall, this is a really nice beer, even if they are a little heavy handed with the sweet chocolate",4.04
Organic Chocolate Stout,"Look: Poured from a pint bottle refrigerated temperature - Extremely dark brown pour with strong notes. Can tell it's brown by holding it up to the light and seeing the hints of brown that seeps within this one. About a inch of foam risen to the surface.
Smell: Getting a strong metallic smell as if I opened a Guinness. Maybe it's the way the Irish brew their beers? Noticed this on quite a few Irish stouts before. Especially Guinness. Got hints of metallic, chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end.
Taste: Wow!!!! Got huge notes of chocolate, malts, and cocoa at the end. Initial contact was chocolate and the end flavor was the cocoa. Very good!!!!
Feel: Medium bodied beer - Silky smooth chocolaty rich and very delicious.
Overall: I'm going to say this is the BEST chocolate stout I've ever tasted and if you see this in the store - well it's your lucky day if you decide to buy it. I'm going to buy it in bulk tomorrow.",5.0

F-smooth, medium bodied, with a little stickiness
O-a successful American beer that gives a successful homage without being a copy.",4.15
Pranqster,"Poured into a pint glass: color is straw gold, slight haze, head pours 1/2 finger thick and dissipates quickly to nothing except thin ring along the glass side, limited lacing on glass sides.

Smell is Belgian esters, lighter phenols, bubble gum, toast, bread, yeast byproduct, honey and fruitiness from yeast.

Taste is similar with esters, light phenols, Belgian yeast byproducts, bread, candi sugar and some honey, stone fruit, straw, bread/wheat.

Mouthfeel is lower carbonation, moderate sweetness, low/moderate bitterness, drying from the fermentation/finished gravity, then some lingering sweetness.

Overall a very pleasant, sweeter Belgian golden ale - yeast and esters are subtle but enticing, sweetness counters dryness, but still overall an interesting ale.",4.14

Pours a clear deep golden with a smallish head. Collapses into a frothy ring and dusty wisps streaking across the surface. Not much active carbonation. Smell is light banana / yeasty esters, something else in there that I can't put my finger on. Fruity. Maybe pear.

Taste is following along pretty closely, but there's an oaky astringency and a woody bitterness, too, making it much less one-note.

Mouthfeel is dry and light. Overall, this is a nice beer. As good as I remember it being.",4.0

Feel is just slightly oily. Excellent ale.",4.13
Pranqster,"Minimal head, lovey hazy orange body. Bread, banana, light esters, and light pine aromas. Taste follows suit, with bready malt, mild piney hops that produce a well balanced bitterness, becoming sweet banana and fruit esters, finishing with orange peel and hints of clove. Feel is wet and creamy, and the alcohol is present throughout the sip (though not strongly so).
Fruit, spices, and cream. Nuff said.",4.18
Pranqster,"A really well done Belgian Ale. Yeasty and sweet, grassy, earthy but enough hops to balance it out. I've been in craft beer sampling for over 10 years now and I can't believe this North Coast beer has missed my radar all this time. I'll really enjoyed it and recommend.",4.5

Flavors of malt, candi sugar, wheat, light spices, light Belgian yeast. Smooth, a very good lighter body, well carbonated.

Maybe not top tier for the style, but well made and enjoyable. A fairly classic interpretation of the style that’s worth a purchase at a great price point.",3.99
Pranqster,"It smells sweet like apples, pears and yeasty bread water. Maybe even a little grapy.

It's as sweet as it smells with the funky yeasts of a Belgian ale.  It's got the taste of wine.

The mouthfeel is thin and really bubbly with carbonation.  The finish is long, clean and fruity with a little bite of bitterness.

Overall it's a very drinkable Belgian ale. I give it a 5.1 out of 6.",4.25

Pranqster,There isn't much to say about this beer that already hasn't been said. It's good! The dangerous part about it is that it is way too smooth for the ABV. you could definitely be on your behind if you're not careful.,4.56
Pranqster,"Translucent beer with an unfiltered look. Light head without much lacing. Smell nicely previews the yeastiness that comes about in the front and back of the beer. Taste is smooth and interesting, as the full malty flavor of the ale comes in the front and stays in the back of the mouth throughout.

Pranqster,"Separating a 4-pack of 12oz bottles. North Coast Brewing's Old Rasputin is one of my all time favorite beers. I am excited to mull this over.
Pours a vibrant copper-orange, SRM 8. with an active, mousse-like off-white head, thin. Bubbles are small and fast to rise. There is a bit of cloudiness, but it is still clear. On the nose I get ripened banana and honey grain. Coriander with clove? A blanketing bouquet of flowers. All the notes are rather humble but synergize complexly. It tastes zingy upfront, but very rapidly mellows into sweeter baked goods. Banana again. It almost tastes like a shocktop with added dimension. I swear there are micronotes of coriander and orange peel. Hop bitterness (Saaz) short-lived next to the slurry of malt and corn. It has a body to it, and medium-high carbonation. Oily yet soft.
I am thoroughly impressed with this Belgian Golden Ale. All reminiscent of Belgian styles, softer, sweet bread, subtle ester combinations. It is fruitier, with less caramel, compared to say, a tripel. And not as hefty. Let us not be deceived by the 7.6ABV, I wouldn't have guessed blindfolded, it is much smoother. A yeasty, golden bouquet to satisfy any palate.",4.21

Pranqster,"pours a hazy pale red-tinged orange body with a small white foamed head that has low retention and leaves only occasional splatters of lacings as it settles to a thin cap with a defined halo

aroma is a floral lush citrus with lowkey Belgian spices (clove, caramelized banana) and obvious nod to Belgian yeast of the barnyard variety

as far as taste goes, the bright, floral and lush citrus form the majority while leaving room for the Belgian yeast, and having a background spice spread that is enhanced by a low grade caramel sweetness. an earthy dose of hop hangs around as well, providing a rounded out bitterness to balance the sweetness of the the citrus.

feel if high carbonation, medium-light body. runs smooth throughout and finishes slightly earthy bitter

overall:
fruit forward with a rustic barnyard Belgian yeast funk and spices coming last along with earthy hop.
it's an agreeable but somewhat funky sipper that keeps the hallmarks of the style but is far closer to a fantastic tribute than being the real deal. that's not necessarily bad, however. just is what it is. I enjoyed it tremendously.",4.11

A Little Sumpin' Wild,"The appearance has a golden amber/maybe closer to a yellow colored body, one finger white foamy head that dissipates and leaves a nice spider web speckled faded looking lacing, light carbonation is seen rising. The smell is slightly sour and/or tart mango/lemon fruitiness up front, hops showing some pizazz. The taste is basically the same adding a bitterness from the hops that seem to be showing a bit more, lemony aftertaste, quick dry finish. The palate sits light on the body, pretty sessionable (perhaps poundable to some). Carbonation is somewhat sharp which is good for the style and I say good to me. Overall, I say this is a good Belgian IPA by style that I would have again.",4.16

A Little Sumpin' Wild,"Very pretty color, orange, full on 5/6"" of white head. Carbonation tight, aroma was interesting, lots of hops hitting those tropical fruit strides. Belgian yeast. This is what I imagine a first tier Belgian ipa to be like in this day and age. Give me some yeasty and hoppy competition.

Taste is both of those with a very dry and welcome finish. Hides the strength so well. A fun beer, doesn't seem to be as plentiful since its first year, but always a welcome addition, I dig it.",4.23
A Little Sumpin' Wild,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 1 pint 6 oz bottle into a tulip glass. The label lists the abv at 8.85%, 1.082 OG and 72.51 IBU. It also note that it was fermented with the Westmalle yeast strain.

Appearance: The body has a deep amber color with a thick cloudy yeast haze. It’s topped off with a quick setting head of off white foam. Only a light thin film covering remains after a minute. Lacing is minimal and slick.

Smell: The aroma has sweet bready maltiness with notes of honey and then loads of pineapple, apple peel, orange peel and some pine like hops.

Taste / Palate: The flavor is full of sweet honey notes inside of a deep bready and yeast like base with waves of different fruity notes. My bottle is fairly well aged so hop bitterness is much lower than a fresh bottle. It also worth noting that the 8.85abv is not noticeable at all. The palate and feel are fairly full and smooth. Carbonation is low.",3.92
Purple Haze,"Look: Nice color, very interesting looking beer.

Smell: Smells fine, kinda smells like raspberries but not a lot like it. Even though it's a raspberry lager.

Taste: Initial taste is fine at best, after taste is really good, best aftertaste of any beer that i've had, but that's not why we rate beers.

Feel: Fine, nothing special, just fine.

Purple Haze,"this brew isn't incredibly special but it is very recognizable once you've had it. the dark stone fruit tang tinge is barely there, with the malt being the primary taste factor here, but it is a pleasant addition. it could be amped up in the fruit area to really step into something more notable, but as a simple session'r, it ain't half bad, and sure beats any of the bland swill from mega-corps, and they've managed to stay privately owned all this time, so it's nice to support such spunk.
if you want a much more effectively executed fruit-themed brew from them, try the Strawberry Lager if you can find it.",3.44

L - Hazy light orange with a two-finger cream head.
S - Wheat-backed floral notes. Berry, but unsure what sort.
T - Whole wheat, grass, and a touch of petunia. Extremely light raspberry note towards the finish. Not bitter at all.
F - Extremely carbonated. Light, crisp, clean. Very refreshing.
O - I've had this beer before on multiple occasions, and I'm happy to review it for the first time [officially]! It's a refreshing brew for certain, with a vague berry aroma and a wheat-filled aroma. Unfortunately, the raspberry flavor doesn't exactly come out as advertised. In a beer where they make it the main attraction, that's not really a great thing. Will buy again on the basis of its refreshing nature for the price, but it's not something to go out of your way to purchase.",2.95
Purple Haze,"This is a great beer and completely underrated on BA. There is a fruity, berry essence that permeates a sweet, malty backbone, with a slight finish of resiny hops.

Liberty Ale,">BIAS ALERT<
I'm not a big fan of West coast IPAs.
Some are good. Most aren't.

Now to the Liberty Ale!

Poured a BEAUTIFUL color of a polished piece of amber. Lots of bubbles. Head stuck around for 5+ minutes. Nice lacing! Taste is strictly that Cascade Hops taste, not too bold but just enough to get that bitter mouthfeel. Nice carbonation! Not much of a lingering bitter aftertaste like I've experienced with some beers (Rebel Rouser, Ranger IPA, Torpedo). Definitely a nice, refreshing brew.

Overall I think it's a great beer for a hot day or a nice drawn out bbq.",3.91
Liberty Ale,"I like this beer, I picked up a 12 ounce can at my local La,bodega and noticed right off the bat that it was crisp/clean..

I poured a 12 ounce can into my 16 ounce Belgium tulip glass, and got a nice 1 1/2 finger head with a beautiful copper glow...This is a nice beer because it's a traditional straightforward ale... I don't have to worry about chill haze, and white chunks floating around in it like all these other millenial, HAZY, IPA's I've been running into lately...

Nice and crisp..That means alot these day's for me...This beer has a very safe, clean beer taste, that I will definitely keep my eyes open for in the future...Definitely will make it's way into my rotation..I love this Ale...",4.06
Liberty Ale,"Liberty Ale is a crisp, solid, toasted session IPA classic that has really stood out over the years. Liberty Ale is clean, medium-bodied, well-filtered & to this day one of my favorite daily drinkers. My refrigerator almost always has a six pack of Liberty Ale in it.

I really enjoy the hop profile of this beer. To me, Liberty Ale is the epitome of a West Coast IPA. I live in the Northeast and we have an absolutely horrendous assortment of Anchor beer on the shelves at most grocery stores such as Wegmans or ShopRite. Unfortunately, Anchor's sales reps just don't get the job done here in New England.

Every time I'm out in San Francisco I make sure to imbibe on all of the wonderful bruise that we miss out on from Anchor, here in the Northeast.",4.12
Liberty Ale,"Poured from a 12 ounce can into a Shaker pint glass, there is no ""best by"" date that I can find.

APPEARANCE: Pours a clear, copper color with one-finger off-white head that slowly dissipated until a thin layer of small bubbles remained, heavy lacing on the glass, medium carbonation, a nice looking beer.

SMELL: Sweet bread and flowery, subtle to the nose.

TASTE: Initially sweet honey and then a flowery hop profile that lingered in a good way.

PALATE: medium body and carbonation.

OVERALL: this is a mild tasting IPA by today's standards but I really enjoyed having it, hard to believe it was being brewed in the dark ages of beer in 1975, I would buy this again no problem and would recommend to anyone who likes craft beer.",3.92
Liberty Ale,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery pint glass

A: Pours crystal clear golden amber with a frothy eggshell white head that settles to a firm layer and laces nicely.

S: Herbal spicy pine, citrus zest, floral notes, lightly toasty bready malt, and just a touch of sweeetness.

T: Classic Cascade hops in their purest form, spicy pine, citrus zest, grapefruit and lemon, floral notes, slightly toasty bready malt, and a pretty much bone dry finish wit only the lightest touch of malt sweetness.

M: Medium body, moderate carbonation.

O: Was intending for this to be a revisit because I was finally able to find a fresh bottle, but it looks like I've never logged it on here, so...
It might not have all the flash of today's IPAs, but you can see why it grabbed people's attention back in the day and has been brewed ever since. Respect the classics.",3.86
Liberty Ale,"Look: Clear, dark gold. Half a finger of bubbly white head with decent retention.

Smell: Floral. I can smell lavender and orange peel.

Taste: Begins with a floral hop taste, followed by medium hop bitterness that lingers for a bit. Very mild sweet malt at the back that's hard to detect.

Mouthfeel: Slightly thin, with very high carbonation.

Overall: This definitely feels like one of America's first post-Prohibition forays into the IPA. It's historic, but still lacking the punch and complexity of the modern beverage.",3.71

Dortmunder Gold,"It's malt/caramel heavier, that for sure. But it's a good one. Based on what the style is, I would say this beer is good at evoking the pilsner side of things.

Dortmunder Gold,"Found a nice assorted variety pack waiting for me in the fridge when I arrived at the camp this afternoon. We had the Great Lakes IPA a few years back and it was solid. Wondered into the craft lager space a bit this afternoon and while this isn’t a sandbox I love to play in, I took a swing. This is thick, heavy and an absolute loaf of bread in a glass. It has a nice taste, but it’s not something I want more than one of. It’s Boston Lager that’s too heavy and trying to do too much.",3.1
Dortmunder Gold,"Poured a clear orange/copper color with a pale orange head. The head was moderate immediately after the pour and dissipated slowly.

Dortmunder Gold,This lager when poured from Tap has a half inch foamy head. Clear amber color. A sweet hop aroma. A Carmel hop sweet flavor with a slight bitter hop tase over the pallet to counter the sweetness . Great Lakes has a strong winner with Dortmunder Gold Lager!!,4.52
Dortmunder Gold,"A - Pours out a clear orange. A white head, with a full persistent cap after the fade. Lots of fine line lacing on the glass as I drink.

S - Strong hit of sour grain, grassy hop notes, and a bit of minerality.

T - A lovely honey note over a soft, undefined apple or pear flavor, with steeped tea acidity and limestone as the sweetness washes away, then a bitter close that skirts the line between pith and aspirin, staying on the right side fortunately and finishing clean.

M - This beer is so drinkable, despite the fairly challenging flavor profile, because it lands light, closes dry, and leaves you looking for the next drink.

O - The style is not one I seek or particularly enjoy, but this beer illustrates why a good lager of this type can be an enjoyable experience that people want to consume while downing pretzels and sausages. Prost!",4.05

Dortmunder Gold,"Grabbed a Great Lakes variety pack and this is the first one I tried.

It’s golden to amber in color with a limited amount of foam, moderate carbonation, and clear appearance.

The smell is not too strong for me but the malt does come through. There seems to be a hint of citrus as well.

It’s an enjoyable, easy drinking beer that packs a bit more punch than a traditional lager. It has a medium body with no hip bitterness. I’m looking forward to another one.",4.04

Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,"On tap at Rogue in Newport. The color is opaque black, with a nitro head and huge frothy bubbles that are retained on a solid crown. The smell is super oaty, sweet, mollasses, cream, and dark rich malt, not much toast. The taste betrays the smell with licorice and rich oats up front, shifting into sarsparilla and rich toasted malt, finishing on a lingering hop notes and mollasses sweetness. Finish wise this is a dry stout for me, and the mouthfeel is thin for a typical stout and finishes moderately dry, which i find interesting.

This is a great oatmeal stout that stands out different from others that rely on heavy cloying sweetness so often. Great job!",4.4
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,"A- This one pours a very dark brown color and is fairly hard to see through, but some light does pass. The head is rich and creamy, about two fingers in thickness initially and settles fast into a thick layer of foam above the brew itself. Carbonation appears to be about average for the style, while the lacing is tan colored, with very little in terms of cling around the inside of the glass. Decent looking overall

S- Lots of cocoa initially, which gives way to a slightly soapy tang. Underlying notes of black coffee, grassy/grainy oat flake, dark fruit remnants, dark chocolate nougat malt sweetness, and dare I say a piney quality that reminds me of the outdoors....interesting!

T- There is some citrus peel zest, piney resin and overall this isn't good for the style. Unfortunately, it overtakes the chocolate/coffee/char that I was hoping for. As for the more traditional flavors, they are there, but are all over the place, and are more noted on the finish than rather in the middle of the taste. There is a weird lingering aftertaste that is more of hops than anything. The oat dryness is present and I think this is enhancing what I am not liking about the flavors here, which is unfortunate, as I normally like a good Oatmeal Stout.

M/O- Medium bodied and the carbonation is fairly robust too, providing more of a pale ale vibe than anything. Drinkability is poor for this reason and overall this falls short in what I was expecting this to be. Rogue is generally a favored brewery with its offerings in my opinion, but this is about as interesting and enjoyable as a Shakespearean play. Not good.",3.1
Shakespeare Oatmeal Stout,"Poured from a bottle into a stout glass.

Pours a very dark-brown (nearly black) opaque with a creamy dark tan head that lingers for the last finger, giving way to exceptional foam and lacing.

Aromas of bittersweet chocolate, dark coffee roasted malts, and dark fruits.

The brew hits the tip of the tongue with bittersweet chocolate and hints of coffee and roasted grain. And then---the main event arrives in midstream. BIg oat flavor rises above the din, with the grainy oats blending with some subtle but solid dark fruit flavor. Deceptively hidden grassy and earthy hops augment the coffee and chocolate bitterness and bring it all home.

The brew is just shy of full-bodied, with the grainy oats providing a drying finish. Very drinkable for the style.

Exceptional representation of the style.",4.25

S: dark chocolate milk, chocolate cake; subtle toasty-roasty and char notes; earthy, woodsy/piney background hop essence... shows a lil old leather as it goes

T: smooth roasted barley wash up front, cakey malt middle, hint of dark coffee in the finish; big robust piney bitter afterburn humming with the charred roast in the aftertaste; back end is relatively dry - majority of sugars express burnt caramelization... roast and bitter last a long time; delicate toffee-ish sweetness builds

Ultimate Oktoberfest,"1 x 12 oz Bottle
Bottled on: 07.25.2022
Glass: Snifter
Serving Temp: 59.7 F
ABV: 10.0%


Look:
The color is a slightly darker than medium but bright copper with an off-white to cream colored head. The head starts at 2 fingers high (in a snifter) the quickly dissipates to a thick ring and solid island. Good lacing is left on the glass.

Smell:
Rich toasted caramel and toffee. Vanilla, some wood, and some notes of sweet cherries. The nose is sweet, but it is very pleasant. Hops cannot be detected.

Taste:
Toasted caramel and toasted bread are joined by nice whiskey notes along with faint woody and earthy ones. Very mild hops flirt in the background with almost undetectable notes of grass. Near the end of the sip a nice warming sensation develops. The sip finishes as it begins, but with that mentioned warmth added in.

Feel:
Smooth, creamy, and a tad chewy. The body is medium to medium-full.

Overall:
A very tasty beer that is nice for a chilly (or cold) fall night. This one is a slow sipper, not one that you'd fill a half-liter or liter Masskrug and down with abandon.

This a pretty good beer. But it really isn't an amber Marzen nor a golden Festbier. It does fill a niche where you don't quite want a Backwoods Bastard or a Curmudgeon variant (if those are still brewed) and a Marzen just isn't quite enough.

My ratings reflect my overall impressions of this beer, not how closely it hews to style. (It iwas listed as a Märzen) when this review was written)",4.27

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what makes this the ""Ultimate Oktoberfest""? Is it the 10% ABV or the Bourbon barrel aging, or both? Let's find out. It looks like a typical traditional Märzen with a mostly clear deep amber body beneath a short head of white foam. Unfortunately that's dropped and I haven't even raised it to give it a whiff - not so ""ultimate"" in my book. The aroma is good but I don't get a lot of Bourbon or wood, I mainly get caramelish and toasty malt and alcohol. Hmmm, maybe the taste is better? ... ... ... Yes, definitely. It's malty with a light touch of fruitiness. I'm assuming that they've used some Vienna malt here as that'll give you a touch of berry-like fruitiness. It's also bready though so there's probably some Munich malt in there as well. Caramel malt, yes, of course, and mostly golden. It's not as toasty as I thought it would be given the aroma, and there's definitely more Bourbon and oak than I was expecting as well. The alcohol, unfortunately, remains fairly clear but at the same time I expect it to at least some extent and it's not harsh or anything, just clearly noticeable. Ahh, as it warms I'm getting a little bit of a coconut note which is unexpected but quite welcome, and the malt appears more honeyish. A hint of vanilla from the oak rounds it out and the overall maltiness is quite nice. There's enough bitterness there to balance the sweetness of the malt, and just a dollop lingers in the finish. As for hop flavor there's a mild herbal note and some spiciness (unless that's the alcohol), and that also lingers in the finish shortly. I don't know that I'd call this the ""Ultimate Oktoberfest"" but it is quite good. In the mouth it's full bodied and creamy-smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation that at least partially explains the lack of head retention. The 10% ABV also explains some of that. In the end I'm thoroughly enjoying this.

Vanilla, oak, caramel, bourbon. Hardly tastes like an Oktoberfest but I like it. Toffee and some bready malts, but all barrels. Warming, smooth, I like it.",4.1
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Pours a reddish copper, clear, with a light head of foam. Aroma is caramel and some butterscotch with some bready overtones, though faint. Taste is clean and predominantly caramel with a very faint wood grain at the end of the throat. There is little bourbon, in my opinion. ABV is considerably well hidden. A solid Oktoberfest and perhaps my favorite.",4.28
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Very good head production and decent retention. Body is a lovely reddish-amber color, crystal clear.

Very bready nose with herbal hints. It really smells like a classic Oktoberfest, except for the barrel influence - which isn't over the top. Honey, caramel, bread, bourbon, pepper, vanilla. I'm not really sure what to think of the nose, but it's certainly pleasant.

A beer like this runs the risk of being sweet to the point of cloying, but that's not really the case. The bourbon - and the high ABV, to be sure - does add a layer of sweetness, as well as tasting notes of vanilla, honey, and coconut, but there's still a bready, malty Oktoberfest here. Additional tasting notes include caramel, prune, white bread, and pumpernickel.

Fairly noticeable alcohol sting. Medium bodied. Very clean alcohol flavor that one normally gets from spirits, and seems out of place in a beer.

I can't really imagine pouring a Stein of this at an Oktoberfest celebration, but drinking a single glass at your own pace, on your own time, is a pretty rewarding experience. It doesn't all quite work, but it doesn't exactly not work, either. It's a worthy experiment, but it doesn't quite have its own niche, falling between two worlds: one of flavorful but clean lagers, and one of slow-sipping, full-bodied imperial beers. I don't know what mood I would have to be in to want another, frankly.",3.52
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Pours a beautiful clear orange/amber with a thin off-white cap. that leaves spotty lacing. Aroma is caramel, malt, dark bread and bourbon. Flavor follows the nose, a bit sweet and not what I'd consider as an Oktoberfest, but damn is it tasty. Feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, again not what you'd think of when you think Marzan, but leave it to Founders to add some zip.",4.42
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"12oz bottle into a pint mug. Bottled 7/25/22.

Looks pretty good. Crystal clear dark amber body. Small white head shrinks to a ring and faint covering, spots of lacing.

The barrel is very apparent on the nose, but smooth.

On tasting, well, just too much barrel for this palate. It's certainly smooth, but every time the base Marzen tries to assert itself, the barrel is there to kick it back down.

Mouth full, finish smooth bourbon.

Overall, personally I don't think this is a style to barrel age.",3.76
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Look blurs the line between a deep copper and ruby amber ale. Clear but not crystal clear. Very nice frothy head though.

Smell is kind of void. Whack. Honestly all I'm getting is faint sea water. A strange anomaly of a smell I've noted quite a few times before with always seemingly nothing else detectable. I wonder what the common denominator is in these beers that I smell this and nothing else. Or I'm just off?

Taste/feel. Very interesting. Definitely get the barrel right up front. Insanely, insanely dry. Flavors are very, very tame and subdued. It has tastes like a very light oktoberfest with an extra sweet element - butterscotch tbh, but not diacetyl. Apart from the overlapping barrel the beer is the farthest thing from complex ever. Its overall not that flavorful apart from the massive barrel that dick slaps you right upfront and lingers far after the finish.

Overall - and I immediately thought this as soon as it touched my lips but I wanted to jot down my notes before coming back to it - its a very nice barrel aged scotch ale. Yes, okay, it's a lager but this drank blind and 100/100 people will tell you its a scotch ale (which is an underrepresented style tbh). Overall score it tricky. I like it but don't love it. I'll happily drink the second I bought and probably buy a few more if im lucky enough to stumble upon them but won't intentionally seek out or trade for. Overall 4.25",4.12
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Pours a clear copper color, small quickly fading white head. Snot factory gets some caramel and some bourbon. Doesn't have the typical Oktoberfest flavors, thin, no carb5to speak of. An interesting take on Oktoberfest beers, good, but a one'n done.",3.79

Appearance. Served in a Belgian snifter, this exceptional marzen has a fine dark copper colored body with high clarity and a very good white head.

There's a pronounced, but not over the top, BBA influence in this outstanding Oktoberfest beer. Good complexity, with quite a bit more in the way of woody notes in the flavor than in the aroma where whisky and grain notes are dominant.

Overall. Well worth seeking out, especially if a fan of BBA beers. Caution: this easy drinking Oktoberfest has high but fairly well hidden ABV>.",4.25
Ultimate Oktoberfest,"Bottled on 7/25/2022. Poured into a Seidel glass. It pours a hazy, honey-amber color with a half finger of creamy, ecru-colored head and lacing. The barrel really influences the smell; the bourbon notes are subtle but distinct. There is also an unexpected grassy aroma. Only as it warms a bit do I detect the nutty caramel in the nose. The bourbon taste is very unique. Again, the bourbon influence is quite strong. But as it warms the Märzen taste emerges. It has a good, creamy mouth feel with pleasant carbonation, and it's definitely big at 10% ABV. Overall, this is one of those ""only in America"" beers. To me, the notion of an ""Imperial Märzen"" is oxymoronic and while the idea of a bourbon-barrel aged Oktoberfest is intriguing, it's also a bit gimmicky. I guess Founders has achieved its goal with this beer but I can't help but think it's messing with something sacrosanct.",3.85

Smell and taste as advertised; pine resin, some grapefruit rind, classic west coast IPA profile. Pretty hoppy/bitter. Medium body, medium carbonation, but smooth mouthfeel. IMO, not nearly as nice as their 25th anniversary offering. At the price I probably won't revisit this one, unless I buy a single can to reconfirm my initial impression.",4.03

A touch of sweetness and a malt fullness in feel but otherwise this is a hop forward and hop dominant drink.
Not sticky and moderate feel. Quite smooth once the sharpness settles down as it warms.",4.04
26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Canned on 8/9/2022 so approximately 5 weeks old when reviewed. Poured into a pint glass. It pours a bright, clear golden honey color with more than a finger of creamy, eggshell-colored head and thick, soapy lacing. Lots of bubbles ascend the glass. The smell features floral hops with notes of lemon peel, grapefruit, and onion. This is a classic West Coast IPA with very bitter citrus and biting Centennial hops. There is also a strong malty backbone but there is almost no sweetness at first. However, as the ale warms in the glass I begin to taste some balancing caramel - although it never overcomes the stringent bitterness. This ale has a moderate mouthfeel with fairly lively carbonation and at 9.7% ABV it has great substance. Overall, if you enjoy an old school West Coast IPA with huge bitter citrus and modest malt presence, then you should seek out 26 Anniversary Imperial IPA while it's available. Really enjoyable! As a bonus, it should age fairly well in the can so don't be put off by the canning date if you haven't tried it yet.",4.19

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Fairly dark coppery body, perfectly crystal clear. Excellent head production and decent retention.

Quite a bit of toasted malt on the nose, crackery and grainy, not unlike a massive amber ale. Naturally, it's dosed with a hefty ration of hops, with notes of pine, bark, candied orange, and grapefruit peel. I wouldn't say it's a dead ringer for a near-10% ABV version of Stone IPA, but the pedigree is certainly evident.

Flavor follows. It's a bitter bomb through and through, equally bold in presentation of hops and malt. Strong semi-sweet notes of caramel, bread, and brown sugar are balanced by orange, pine, honey, leather, and grapefruit peel.

There's some heft to the malt body that belies the boozy strength, and a bit of alcohol bite, but this drinks incredibly smooth. An excellent beer, insanely drinkable for the ABV. Nothing particularly new, but a near perfect reinvention of a classic style.",4.29

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"A dark but shiny amber brew arrived in a pint glass, yes a pint glass, after drawn from a tap. Its white head is modest, but enduring. Sweet malt and soft piney hop aromas merge above the glass. This drinks richly and smoothly, but there is an alcohol bite with it and the esophagus feels the burn. The balance between malty sweetness and hoppy bitterness is a great one. At the onset this almost tastes too sweet, as at the alcohol seems to exaggerate the maltiness. The wonderful balance is best noticed midway through. During the finish the alcohol manages to amplify the bitterness of the hops. The hopping can best be described as piney and resinous. As with many high octane ales, the glass lacing is sparse. Despite its qualities, one pint will be enough for one sitting.",4.25

It is not too boozy tasting, but the alcohol becomes very obvious about 1/2 way though the beer. I LOVE dry hopped (or double dry hopped) beers so I was excited for this, however I am not a huge Centennial fan. So for me, this is not one I will be buying more of.

26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Scaling up and scaling out, Stone gets a little retrospective as they head into year number twenty seven. Looking to the quarter of a century in the making of their flagship IPA, Stone Brewing goes and turns it up to 26.

Doubling down on that IPA, Stone 26th Anniversary Imperial IPA catches the eye with its finely hazy deep golden appearance. Glowing softly, the scent starts to grow with a peppery dankness laced with citrus and hints of stone fruit. All wrapped in a caramelized cocoon of malt, the scent soon gives way to a malty-sweet upstart of light toast, granola and floral suggestions of honey.

A quick transition toward bitterness happens as soon as the ale splashes the middle palate where its malt sweetness starts to dissolve and the floral potpourri and citronella of the nose turns crisp and fruity with pink grapefruit, bitter orange and a hint of jammy apricot. Turning the corner in the final frame, the fruits develop a bitterness of pith and peel while the resinous nature of pine, grasses and botanicals create a dry and bitter late palate.

Stone 26 is a dedicated bitter bomb that'll have the tastebuds crying for mercy. Full bodied, dankly resinous and gripping the gullet with its strong hop bite, Finishing decidedly on the bitter side of bitter-sweet the session concludes with a long and spicy bitterness of pinesol and peppery hemp. ...but in a good way.",4.4
26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"On tap in Meridian. I mean, it’s fine, what did I expect? A little more Amber-colored than I expected, crystal clear though. Pine, malt, resiny bitterness shine, not quite a ‘Ruination’ of my palate but strong, for sure. It’s good but it’s also very familiar, not sure if that’s a bad thing though because I’m pretty sure that’s what Stone is aiming for.",3.75
26th Anniversary Imperial IPA,"Canned on 8-9-22. 12oz can poured into a tulip.

Pours golden with great clarity and transparency; small white head that fades leaving decent retention and sticky lacing.

The aromas are subtle. Some breads, caramel, and malts leading the way. Hints of lemon and citrus. Some floral notes as well.

The flavors are bolder than the nose indicates. Great hop flavors. Nice blend of floral and citrus. Lots of lemon. Some pine and earthy fresh grass. Hints of caramel. Really solid bitterness. Malts do their thing. Finishes dry. Mild warmth in the finish, but it's not hot or boozy. I guess I'd consider this one dangerously drinkable.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's fluffy and smooth.

This is a nice DIPA. Great job of showcasing Centennial hops. The bold hop flavors really takes this one to the next level. It's really enjoyable and fun to drink. Well done.",4.0
Big Hoppy,"Huge head production and fantastic retention and lacing. Body is black as ebony.

Very aromatic from the initial pour, with resinous notes along with candied orange, pine, and star fruit. Perhaps a touch of licorice and brown sugar, but very little else belying the dark roasty legs. That's not a bad thing, necessarily, as Black IPAs (IMO) should still feature the hops prominently, and this one does.

The malt base certainly makes an appearance on the palate, however. Immediately, it comes across kind of creamy and rich, almost - but not quite - like milk with powdered chocolate, or a tootsie roll. This provides a thick base for the bitter and expressive hop notes, including grapefruit, lemon, mango, resin, and pine.

The darker malt returns again on the back end, with a touch of licorice and perhaps molasses. The long-lasting aftertaste is all bitter hop oils.

This is an interesting Black IPA. It's remarkably balanced between the hops and malts. It somehow seems to emphasize the latter without coming across like a hoppy stout; it's still very much an IPA, but the hop flavors aren't quite as explosive (and certainly not as modern) as I would expect. I'm not sure which varietals are in play, but it reminds me more of SNPA and Founders Centennial than Tree House - so, I'm expecting classic PNW hops.

This is really delicious, even if nothing is screaming for attention. Lawson's made a big Black IPA verging on imperial strength that is somehow subtle and restrained.",4.12

This pours black like a full stout. A really impressive tan head with hills sits on top and laces the whole session through.
The aroma is muted by the impressive head, but later on in the session there is caramel with fruity hops pushing through. Still subtle though.
The taste is all malt in the front. Chocolate, charcoal, Milard reaction. There is a hop finish (thank you). I dries things out and gives a little hint of fruit but frankly it's not enough to really call this a n IPA.
Mouthfeel is medium, with an illusion to stickiness, and carbonation is appropriate.
A little more hop hit at the finish would make this an amazing beer. As a lover of dry beers though, I like it.",3.82
Big Hoppy,"Pours black with a creamy tan colored head; pretty vigorous and quick formation, as it settles there is plenty of lacing left behind, full film lacing on side opposite of drinking…some great retention too.

This is definitely a black ipa, the hops jump out of the glass. There is an underlying dankness to this beer with very pleasant hints of evergreen and damp earthy forest air and just the slightest hint fruity grapefruit; underneath it all is some roastiness with minor notes of coffee. Smelled a good 5 minutes before taking a sip…

Oh boy! What a shot of resiny hoppy goodness. This is like biting into a hop cone hugely grapefruit forward with a substantial sappy pine note. Much like the nose it’s all hops first; aftertaste and finish is very roast forward and comes off as more a bitter dark chocolate than the coffee expected from the nose.

Medium body; a smoother than expected carbonation, almost creamy. Huge bitterness on the finish both hop and roast driven. Lingering dry and resiny feel tingles on the tongue long after the sip is gone. Minor hint of warming form the abv.",4.49

Big Hoppy,"This was poured into an English pint glass. The appearance was a black color with a one finger off white to white foamy head that dissipated in rings at a nice pace. Clingy ringy lace. The aroma starts off with sharp roasted malts with a decent resinous bitter hoppiness coming across huge. Dark chocolate. Resinous pine come forth more as it warms. The flavor resides in the bitterness component of the resinous pine, sharp and embracing with a roasted to bitter aftertaste and finish. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable to sipping quality behind it. Resinous bitter edges hit hard enough to claim the style. Overall, damn nice Black IPA that I could have again.",4.24
Liquid Hoppiness,"This beer pours a nicely hazy orange-ish color with a substantial, dense oatmeal colored head that is a lacing magnet. Beautiful beer. The nose is pineapple, tangerine, and lots of berry aromas.

Those aromas directly are transcribed to the taste, with the berry flavors most enjoyable for me because that’s not a flavor profile typically seen in the hazy space.

The mouthfeel is medium and actually a bit on the dry side, which I appreciate. This is an enjoyable hazy in a literal jungle of hazy offerings. I enjoy it (and will enjoy it through the balance of the 6er), but this old beer nerd would’ve preferred to take a ride with an Oktoberfest collab here in the fall of 2022.",3.75

Notes via stream of consciousness: I'm not really sure what to think of this. Another juicy IPA from Sierra? What makes it different? There's nothing on the label but it is 7.0%ABV. It's poured a very hazy golden body with an orange sheen beneath a finger's width of white foam that's holding well. There are both larger and smaller bubbles in the head which is a good sign, and I can see very fine bubbles rising through the particulate in suspension below. The aroma offers tropical notes of orange, mango, distant pineapple, and some woodiness, a light grassiness, and a hint of pine. The taste offers much more woodiness, grassiness, and pine within a fairly wide maltiness. It's not exactly rich, there's not enough there, nor really complex, but it's more complicated than the basic malt that a lot of brewers are using for juicy IPAs. I don't think it's wheat but I could be wrong, and I'm thinking there's some rye there but I think that's because the woody, grassy, and piney hops are suggesting that. I definitely believe are some oats involved as I can taste them. It's an unusual maltiness but I'm not sure how well I actually like it. I think I prefer the more basic malt that lets the hops do their own thing without interference. Anyway, there's less fruit than I thought there would be, and I'm thinking that mango is the dominant note. Of course people taste things differently from each other, and even different from themselves on certain days so who knows. A firm bitterness balances it and it finishes mainly dry with the woody, grassy, and piney hops lingering. It's almost spicy; the woodiness is kind of like cedar. That makes me think of either Sorachi Ace or Sabro hops but neither of those check out in terms of what else they bring to the table so I'm confused as to what they might be using. It's a little floral as well, which I get in the finish. Meh, I'm not blown away by it but it is well brewed. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp-then-smooth. All in all it's decent enough but I'm just not a fan of the recipe. I thought it would be more ""juicy"" as it's labeled as a ""JUICY IPA"" but I do like the spicy woodiness.
Review #8,247",3.98
Liquid Hoppiness,"12 oz. can, PKGD 07/05/22 stamped on the bottom of the can. From the 12 pack case; my first review on BeerAdvocate in over 5 years, but i digress.. and alas,

Poured into a Piraat snifter.

A - Pours a crisp fruity orange juice color, with little over a finger of frothy head with lingering lace. Looks excellent.

S - Smell is fresh, fruity, tropical, floral. Very miiiild alcoholic scent is present when you look for it, as are some pale bread malts. Stone fruits. Smells fresh, above all else.

T - Taste brings in much of the same: citrusy orange juice, acidity, & a mild warming alcoholic bite.

F - Smooth, crisp, easy-drinking. Bitter & dry in the finish, which beckons you for another sip. Highly drinkable stuff for sure, one could easily crush three or four or five of these in a session.

Overall, a nice drinkable sessionable beer; though typical of the style. I'd call it a slightly above average though not amazing beer. 7/10 would drink again, which will come out to

Sierra Nevada Liquid Hoppiness IPA -----3.5/5",3.58
Liquid Hoppiness,"Poured from a 12oz can stamped 07/20/22 to a Nonic at fridge temp.
This pours hazy light gold but not hazy enough to hide the many many rising bubbles near the glass wall. Despite an average pour I got a large pillowy white head. I had to be patient to get the full 12oz in a 16oz glass. The head lasts quite long, though not the entire session. Lacing is impressive.
The aroma is a little musty and fruity, but almost goes away completely after a few minutes. Sniff early with this one.
The taste is somewhat fruity, but not amazing. Alcohol makes itself known on the finish, this may be a reflection of the almost 2-month age of this can.
Mouthfeel is light for the style and carbonation is on the other end of the scale.
Not bad, but not impressive. Hopefully I will come back and edit this review if I catch a fresh can.",3.44
Liquid Hoppiness,"12 oz can from a 6pk poured into a pint glass.

L - Pours a slightly hazy straw-orange color with carbonation and some murkiness throughout. Almost a bit of sediment present but maybe the glass isn't 100% clean. A good finger of bright white head that dissipates leaving a moderate lacing.

S - Faint citrus, honey, malt, slightly hoppy, mostly orange and pineapple coming through with a typical SN Pale Ale aroma. Nothing overpowering or standout.

T - Follows the nose with lots of citrus rind and pineapple. Slightly astringent alcohol in the middle, a decent hoppy bite, not one I'd consider ""juicy"" compared to others but on the sweeter IPA side. Finished with a little bready malt to balance it out.

F - Light-to-medium bodied, lightly moderate carbonation, slightly wetter finish but drinkable for a 7% ABV.

O - Picked this up as a big fan of SN's offerings, the design, and interest in ""juicy"" IPAs. While I wouldn't classify this is as particularly ""juicy"", it's drinkable, fairly balanced, and decently priced for a 6pk. Not sure I'd pick it up again but a valiant effort from Sierra Nevada.",3.73

Liquid Hoppiness,"Enjoying my first poured into a pint glass from a 12 oz. can. Gentler in the body and the hoppiness when compared to Sierra Nevada pale ale and their Torpedo strong IPA. Lighter in the mouthfeel than both as well and, as such, is more drinkable than both, in my opinion (and I like both). They label it a “juicy IPA” but I don’t find it overly citrusy and, in fact, picked up on interesting spice notes in the aroma. You don’t have to be a hophead to love this beer which is refreshing. I don’t mind aggressively hopped IPAs (usually) but I prefer a cleaner finish with less lingering bitterness at the back of the tongue (Stone IPAs) like I find here. Would love to try a draught pint of this brew. Pleasantly surprised by this blind purchase. Nice job, Sierra Nevada!",4.01
Liquid Hoppiness,"12oz can.

Liquid Hoppiness,"Picked up a 6 pack of this from the guns, ammo, liquor and porn store that is Mormon owned. No lies.

Pours a slightly cloudy (not really hazy) yellow color. 1/2"" white head. The aroma didn't really display the commercial tugjob re: juicy ipa. The Cascade and Centennial seemed to dominate with just a little input from the other proprietary varieties. Grapefruit is the biggest component, but without the usual Sierra Nevada caramel hit.

Taste is fine. Right away I'm like ""Another Sierra Nevada 3.75"". There is more influence from the Azacca/Sultana hop set, indeed giving the beer a light pineapple and cranberry like edge. Some more varied citrus, candied orange like impression sets in. Shows off the lighter more nimble malt body than many of the old school Sierra Nevada hoppy beers have. Its a pretty easy drink, nothing in terms of abv or ibu is abrasive.

I don't think it will be around for a long time, it won't become a ""classic"" beer in their portfolio, but so what, its not here for a long time, its here for a good time, and at $9/6 pack, it definitely provides an affordable good time.",3.69
King AL,"First saw this when i received an email from Half Time. Looked really interesting to me as I like both brewers. My highest rated beer was a collaboration between Toppling Goliath and Tree House. I would think that this brew would be a similarly great collaboration. Was please to learn that it was available at Empire liquors. I walk into “the good beer section” of the cooler and I cannot find it. The beer guy walks in and points in me in the direction of the last 4 pack. It is mine!

Brewers Notes: King AL uses a mashed-up grain bill from MC² and Toppling Goliath’s King Sue before introducing Equilibrium’s absolute biggest dry-hop to date with an all Citra Incognito, Citra LUPOMAX, Citra Cryo and Citra T-90 hop bill. Pouring a milky opaque yellow with aromas of mango sorbet and orange creamsicle, we get chewy saturated flavors of tropical smoothie, fresh squeezed navel orange juice, dank grass, fruit salad in syrup and lime gummies with a thick and custard like creamsicle finish and a huge blast of EQjuice rainbow melon flavors. King AL is dangerously soft and smooth and may have you questioning the laws of physics, space, time or just how we got a melted orange creamsicle fruit bomb into the can.

Chilled can poured into a spiegelau ipa glass . Pale hazy honey colored liquid topped by a creamy white one finger foam cap , reduces to a thick layer and leaves some spotty lacings.

King AL,"Canned on 8/29/22; consumed on 9/21/22

Pours a turbid, baby food-orange body capped with just shy of two fingers of rich, white foam; decent head retention leaves a vague, paper-thin layer of cap, thin, frothy collar, and healthy spatter of soapy, webby lacing sprayed across the walls of the glass.

Aromas burst with a ripe, tropical overload, bringing guava, orange, grapefruit, and tangerine juice into subtle dankness with boggy resins interspersed; lemon gummies accent mango, while shreds of onion deepen an oncoming herbaceousness through the close.

Taste shows orange zest, guava, and juicy papaya upfront, with a slight onion interlude over the mid-palate easing to sweet malts countered late by a delayed, earthy prickle of resins and grass as onion continues to linger through notes of citrus zest on the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a body on the fuller side of medium with a subdued, moderate carbonation, leaving an almost soupy density and gritty resins for contrast; briefly taut through the mid-palate as a juicy build leaves a silky back end and finish.

A sampling of the purest variety across the hop spectrum; diverse, intriguing, and complete in expressing myriad tropical undertones atop a resinous, quasi-bitter base; a sippable coalescence for the hop-inclined senses.",4.27

Oktoberfest,"Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug
Temp at Pour: 50.4


Look:
Nice medium and clear copper. Initial 2-finger off white head appears creamy and dissipates very slowly to a thickness of a single finger.

Smell:
Nice toasted bread notes along with earthy grains and hints of toffee and a touch of caramel. The noble hops provide notes of grass with a touch of fresh hay and some light floral notes as well.

Taste:
Sweet bready malts and toasted toffee/caramel start things off and are quickly met by the grassy hops that provide a very mild spice and balance the sip out. Some note of pumpernickel or rye float around in the background with a faint nuttiness. The sip finishes dry, a tad toasty, and mildly spicy. The flavors might be toned down compared to some other Märzens but they are impeccably balanced. The high ABV (for the style) is not noticeable.

Feel:
Clean and smooth. Almost creamy. Body is medium-light.

Overall:
I was looking forward to trying this and am glad that I did. Troegs did not disappoint. This is a nice, very easy-drinking amber Märzen. It is going down very quickly. Is it as good as the German staples (Paulaner, HP, Ayinger, Spaten)? Nope. But it is quite good regardless. This will become part of my annual Oktoberfest rotation. I am glad that I picked up a six pack (so far). I'll be going back for more.

The use of Pilsner and Munich malts w/o any Caramel malt was an interesting choice. I think that it works. The lack of Caramel malt is likely what contributes to the toned down flavors (esp malts and toastiness) but it does make the beer more quaffable and lets the dryness come through more distinctly.",4.05

Beautiful looking festbier, with light visible carbonation and a khaki to orange mixed colored head which is superfine. Body color is a golden amber, nearly orange bronze mix which is shiny and glimmering. Very good looking brew.

Quite a neat aroma. Clean sensing but a distinct emphasis on malt that goes with a mix of caramel and distinct milk chocolate as well. Light touches of herbal hop and even a bit of nutty sensations too. Very nice.

Palate fits real nicely. Milky sensations of cream and caramel, with a toasty aroma and hops to match. Light herbal presence not just in the finish but in the mid palate too for excellent malt contrasts. Creamed caramel and milk chocolate seem to be even more pronounced as well, with a robust mouthfeel. Superior clean finish, and even manages to stay dry.

Oktoberfest,"12oz bottle into a pint mug. New release, dating too difficult for these old eyes.

Looks splendid in the glass. Crystal clear amber body with a decent white head. Only a little lacing.

Caramel malty aroma.

On tasting, clean, sweet, malty, no aftertaste. Could drink these all night long. Hop an afterthought here.

Mouth medium, finish a crisp clean sweet wash.

Oktoberfest,"(12 oz bottle, freshest by 120122; purchased single off shelf at Total Wine... poured into a 14 oz mug)

L: polished-clear, tawny-amber liquid; finger-high foam build on pour, collapsing into thin cap... only a thin, crescent collar remains; very little lace

S: lightly-sulfured, herbaceous pretzel crust; a malt aroma rich in depth and dimension; grainy up top, doughy below... nutty and apple-y highlights... slight accent of noble hops; little alcohol presence, just an overtone

T: doughy, moderately-toasty foundation, big and round malts unfloding with each sip... grassy bitter top note in the aftertaste, accompanied by some salty pretzel crust at the back and sides... lingering chewy bread crust essence... missing a small amount of lasting depth or nuance

F: near plush in its texture, mildly inflated core; little latent carbonation... I did drink this relatively 'warm', so maybe it gassed off too much... the alcohol and hops team to stoke a mild heat at the back of the palate... despite its faintly flabby feel, it drinks really darn quick with a soft touch of residual malt sludge

O: they did not disappoint with this; it's pretty much how I wished a few of the other 'big-name' local breweries would've made their O'Fest... worthy of purchase in bulk (2012)",4.18
Oktoberfest,"Poured into a wide mouth shaped glass: color is copper, transparent, slight head appears with an off white color then dissipates to a thin ring on the glass sides.

Smell is munich, vienna malt, toast, bread, light fruitiness, pleasant hoppy crispness.

Taste is on the maltier side for style but really well done: notable German malt, toast, bread, slight fruitiness, hoppy crispness to finish.

Mouthfeel is crisp carbonation, moderate sweetness, lower bitterness, lingering crisp sweetness.

Overall a really well done Marzen/Oktoberfest style - sweet malt, moderate crispness/hoppiness.",4.21

Oktoberfest,"Better than I was expecting.
I was expecting this to be overly hoppy for the style as most Tröegs beers are, but I would say they cut off just at the right time. Any more and it would ruin the beer.
Pours the usual color with the usual Märzen flavor, albeit on the higher side of the hop schedule.
Overall, better than I expected but not as good as the German staples.
I'd get it again, but there are others I enjoy more.
Worth a try.",4.54

The flavors follow the nose. More toast and caramel leading the way. There's a nice little sweetness coming through. There's also a subtle earthiness as well. Mild bitterness. Solid malt backbone. Alcohol goes unnoticed.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's very fluffy and slightly creamy. Very smooth and easy to drink.

Great aromas. Melon, pineapple, peach, grapefruit, mango, chive, grass, white pepper.

Juiced but not juicy. The bitter and mildly grassy/herb hop notes are more aggressive, lending welcome balance. Orange, grapefruit, peach, mango, and white grape in the front of the palate. Citrus zest and pith in midstream. Grass, chive, and peppery booze (but not boozy) at the finish.

Medium to medium-full bodied but it doesn't feel that heavy. Not sweeet or sticky, but drying on the palate.

This Festbier Looks only slightly above average compared to its style: a beautiful bubbly blond, but very short hair (I mean foam.) Smells open as a malt-head's delight, but end more mediocre. Tastes are balanced, remain sweet but never stay too sweet. Refreshing and medium-mouthed, I want this Fest next year.

Weihenstephaner Festbier,"[At a local Oktoberfest]
vom Fass (on/from Draft)
Glass: 0.5 L Festmug
2022-Sep-18


Look:
Clear and bright golden yellow with a 2 finger rocky head. The head quickly faded to nothing, likely due to the glass not being clean (it was my 2nd beer at the 'Fest)

Smell:
Spicy and floral hops that almost come across as citrusy. Almost. Light bready malts are hiding in the background but are definitely there.

Taste:
Follows the nose/aroma. The light malts are biscuity and even a tad cracker-like. The finish is on the dry side.

Feel:
Crisp and clean but also soft. The body is light-medium or even a shade lighter.

Overall:
A decent Festbier that is insanely quaffable and perfect for a warm day (like today was for a time). This brew is very much like a (slightly) amped-up Helles with some Pilsner hops/bitterness.

1.5 x 333 ml bottles
Bottle Date: 1261 => 28 June, 2021
Consumed on: 25 Aug, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug


Look:
Clear golden yellow with a 4-finger frothy and pillowy white head. The head very slowly fades to about a 1 finger of bubbly foam. Lacing is excellent.

Smell:
Mildly Bready and slightly grainy. There is a very light touch of lemon and also of uncut grass. A mild zest is present as well.

Taste:
Very similar to the nose with an extra lightly tart note in there. The sip finishes slightly dry but nowhere near bitter.

Feel:
Crisp and soft. Body is just about light-medium

Overall:
A light, mellow, and easy drinking Festbier. This is very much like a (slightly) amped-up Helles. I prefer Festbiers with more flavor and body, like Tucher, or a Dortmunder like Augustinerbräu-Munchen Edelstoff (which has been served at the Munich Oktoberfest in the past) but this is nice for warmer weather. I am drinking this one in the evening of a 90-degree late August day and it is just fine.",3.78
Weihenstephaner Festbier,"I would have rated this beer perfectly, however, perfection only exists in dreams, so in a rational sense I rate it nearly perfect.

I've been drinking German beer since 1977, and this by far is arguably, in my experience anyway, the best Lager period... It is important to ensure it's fresh.

I'm a fan of Marzen type beer, malty lagers that pack a punch, but are smooth and balanced. I've tried most of all the offerings by European brewers since about 2000 (when I discovered Marzens) and this beer repeatedly beats them all! Hofbrau's Marzen several years ago was also OUTSTANDING...on par or better then this, but last year they cheapened it, and the carnage is again the theme with Hofbrau's version this year. I will never understand this! Hofbrau if you are reading this BE ASHAMED! If you need to charge more because your costs have risen DO SO! Don't make it cheaper!!

The beer is crisp, clear, maintains a nice head ALL THE WAY down in your glass. Alas, let's not forget the flavor is IN THE HEAD, hence why when beer performs like this it retains it's crisp, carbonated flavor all the way down. This beer also leaves generous lacings on your glass, and it's a beautiful beer to behold,. Simply near perfect! If you're a fan of the Marzen style, I invite you to try it out. Just be sure it is fresh.",4.88
Weihenstephaner Festbier,"Pulled from fridge and allowed to sit at room temp ~ 10-15 min, before pouring into a round-bottomed stein.

Look: Golden, straw-colored, with a 2-finger, white head. Lots of effervescence

Smell: Light malts, slight fruitiness, some sour notes on the nose

Taste: Light, mild flavor profile. Some initial malty sweetness, followed by light, herbal hops. Lingering sweetness on the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin, with good effervescence to help bring it body. Very light feel & weight overall, finishes clean, with minimal residue

Overall: Bright, semi-sweet, with herbaceous notes. A very easy, sessionable drinker, and one that is suitable for a multitude of occasions. Definitely worth the buy and worth the diversion from my usual ambers, browns, and darker ales",3.5
Weihenstephaner Festbier,"While very complex, they get it right. There is a lot in this bier, but it all works. I think if I had to drink one beer the rest of my life.... So far this would be it. (Wouldn't be the best for a day on the beach / water / boat when your are looking at a long day and most likely over a 12 pack per person; But I would try)",4.7
Weihenstephaner Festbier,"Look: Clear light orange-yellow with a frothy white head that builds up, holds, and then recedes, leaving sticky lacing clung to the glass’ rim
Aroma: Freshly baked bread, raw bread dough, floral hops, a little honey, and biscuits
Taste: Kicks off with bready malt and a big bouquet of floral goodness – black locust, flowering cherry, and yellow azalea amongst them and followed by a rich doughy punch. Bread, honey, biscuits, and flowers play tug-of-war until floral hops regain dominance on the close
Mouthfeel: Light but full, extremely clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and a clean and crisp but slightly soft finish
Overall: This is some tasty stuff. I love this beer and am totally biased towards it but it’s hard not to be with how well-made and delicious it is. A Festbier through and through and one of the gold standards at that with plenty of malt, bread, and dough along with a floral hoppy side that shines in these lighter-styled Oktoberfests.

Weihenstephaner Festbier,A wiesen style beer vs marzen. Light crystal clear malty lager with a bit of citrus and hops to balance the sweetness. You can drink this all day in spite of 5.8% abv. Fresh and highly drinkable. Get some.,3.99
Weihenstephaner Festbier,"Sampling a lightly chilled 11.2 oz bottle poured into my .5L dimple mug. Been meaning to get to this since Oktoberfest, just havent opened it. Date code is 0201 16:55:09.
The beer pours a bright clear golden straw color with a fizzy bleached white head of 1 cm foaming up. This foam fades to a sturdy surface layer soon after the pour. Several active streams of carbonation rise to the surface to feed the foam.
Aroma is some cracker malt and a bit of light honey note. Nose is very mild overall.
First sip reveals a light body with smooth texture and very mild carbonation.
Flavor is some bready malt and crackers, a bit of honey again and here I get some spicy or black tea hops that linger with a little bitterness after each swallow. Finish is sort of dry and the beer drinks very easy.

Oktoberfest,"Got on tap at Brick and Porter in a 20 oz glass.
Appears the color of iced tea with a light manilla head.
The aroma was faint for me (chemically damaged nose) but mildly sweet malts did present themselves.
The flavors were biscuits and a slight sweetness that was reminiscent of caramel but not as sweet. Munich hops round out the taste.
The feel was ideal for the style, the 20 oz went down with no issues at all.
OA, not the best Märzen style I’ve had, but I could easily drink a couple liters of it if that was what was available.",4.22
Oktoberfest,"Canned on 7/21/22; consumed on 9/20/22

Pours a clear, orange-copper body topped with a finger and a half of fluffy, off-white foam; mediocre head retention leaves a paper-thin layer of cap, a large, frothy collar, and a modest array of splotchy, webby lacing strewn along the walls of the glass.

Aromas show sweet caramel malts laden with honey-soaked toast and bits of more toffeed malt as corn flakes soften the otherwise taut edges of minerality prevalent throughout.

Taste of caramel and taut minerality feed into more passive honeyed dough as shreds of corn flakes past the mid-palate leave a stuff sweetness while simultaneously unable to shake the metallic tinge lingering through the finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-light body and moderate carbonation, dispersing a clean, fluffy prickle to a crisp mid-palate drying quickly with minimal grit through a swift finish.

Detailed sweetness belies a largely clean presentation, leaving a readily apparent lack of cohesion in a rough fusion of disparate elements and choppy lager threads; the lazily saccharine base instinct of the American Oktoberfest is prominent in this particular take on the style.",3.16
Oktoberfest,"Competitive price point on the 12 pack, considering it was shelved next to various variations ; most of which i have tried, the best in the style imo being Von Trapp. Pours a lighter than your average marzen copper color, little head retention or head. about average. light on the lacing. taste seems to style, nothing to jump for joy about. picked up because of the better price point for a 12 pack of cans, would purchase again. pretty mediocre and perhaps even lower in quality when compared to yuengling.

Oktoberfest,"Did they alter this?? I had it last year and it was good, but this 2022 version is crazy good! In fact, it’s great! Listen, we all know a marzen/Oktoberfest lager can only be so much. What makes great lagers great is how well they do the simplicity. Are they staying true to the original style? Are we getting the traditional aromas and flavors? Does it feel the way a lager should? Is it smooth with the right carbonation? etc… etc… A great lager has you wanting to take another big sip.. It doesn’t have you bored… thinking to yourself, “should have I went with another offering?” This is arguably the best American made marzen I’ve had outside the one from the American lager masters in Cleveland! This has Founders written all over it and it’s freaking delicious! Idk, but this is different than past offerings. Beautifully festive artwork on the can and packaging.. looks like a German marzen.. smells and tastes like a German version.. drinks and feels like one. A+ From Founders Oktoberfest in 2022! Exciting even.",4.13
Oktoberfest,"From the 123 oz can in a snifter. This solid fest pours a nice dark
amber with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring, thin
wafting layer, and displays some nice light lacing. Nose of caramel malt,
bread crust, honey, and light floral hops. Flavors follow but surpass with a
fine presentation of bread malts, light biscuit, honey, caramel, and lightly spicy
and floral hop notes. Nice mouth feel; medium body, smooth, light subtly
effervescent carbonation, and a smooth moderately sweet finish.

Overall---excellent!

Oktoberfest,Deep golden brew with huge yellow-white head. Is this a fest or a marzen? The taste will tell. Nose is extremely muted; eventually I detect notes of yeast & sweet malt. Carbonation is slight. The body is surprisingly full for a beer of 6% ABV. There's some complexity to the malt flavors. It is a marzen.,3.49

Oktoberfest,"2022 Update: Very mild aromas. Flavors are malty, but once again muted. I'm not sure what happened to this one. I used to think it was great, but now two years in a row I'm starting to second guess this one...


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2021:
Appearance: Pours a deep, clear, orange color with a soft off white head. SRM of 12-13. (4.25)

Aroma: Mild aromas of toasted bread, sweet caramel, honey. A little spice. A strong alcoholic and phenolic permanent marker aroma on the finish. (3.50)

Flavor: Also mild flavors of sweet German bread glazed with baked caramel, light cinnamon, syrup & rye. Bready and caramel fullness. Mildly sweet, but also well-toasted malt with some moderately hefty spice. Adequately toasted. Mildly spiced though and not overly so. Smooth. (4.00)

Feel: Medium mouthfeel with a moderate carbonation to finish fairly clean, but mildly sweet. Finishes into a full body. (4.25)

Compared to Great Lakes Oktoberfest 9/20/20: Pours a similar color. More caramel aromas/flavor. Less red apple, cherry, and pear. Slightly more bready, honey and less tart. More authentic and less roasty. Winner: Great Lakes
10/31/20: Pours an identical color. More honey/caramel malt aroma/flavor. Less flower, fruit, and cherry spice.
10/8/21: Slightly darker. Stronger phenolic and caramel flavors. Less citrus and hops. Sweeter and more phenolic.

Compared to Lake Time Oktoberfest 11/10/21: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. Less floral and brown toast. More smooth and sweet caramel malt with a heavier body. Larger and sweeter.

to Odell Oktoberfest 11/18/21: Pours slightly darker, but similar. More toasted malt, crumbs, and toasted bread on the aroma. Less syrup, sweet bread, and toffee. More spice. Winner: Founders

Overall: Malty and smooth with honey and caramel. A decent amount of spice. Sweet bread, caramel, and malty flavors, but the spice is muted. Malty, but not overly roasted like you might expect from some. Still, shas that phenolic and alcoholic flavor cloying sweetness. That said, it's pretty good, but not what I remember from previous years. (Final Rating: 3.73)",3.73
Oktoberfest,To me this a odd tasting Marzen. Has a weird artificial flavor and dryness in the middle before finishing slightly sweet. If I didn't know better I would say this had a lot of crystal malt in it. Has a pleasant Noble hop flavor and bitterness is enough.,3.74
Oktoberfest,"Solid stuff here, very impressed when I tossed this in the mix with some perennial favorites of the style. Beautiful dark copper pour with a great pillow of white foam and great lacing. Both aromas and flavors are well balanced malty/crackery goodness with a just slightly dry finish. A bit much on the carbonation level is my only complaint. Well done.",4.23
Oktoberfest,"For a brewery that enjoys moving the needle and pushing boundaries when it comes to beer, Toppling Goliath shows tremendous restraint in making a time honored, classic and traditional fest beer.

Their Oktoberfest pours with a frothy deep gold with strikingly bright clarity. As a stark white froth builds toward the brim, the nose fills with a light and savory scent of fresh bread, nuttiness, crust and a bright and floral bouquet. Leading with malt flavors, the initial sip is juicy with bready sweet flavors accented with bread crust, cashew, croissant and biscotti.

With the malt sweetness staying ahead of the pack, the flavors are met with a light hop fruitiness that develops into a spicy and light bitterness that simply takes an edge off of the lingering malts. Lightly grassy, peppery and bright, the hops take the session into an even keel balance and a snappy finish.

Medium-light in its body, the beer trends drier than most with a brisk mineral bite and a racy sense of carbonation that gives the beer a pop on the late palate but doesn't settle with the elegance or smoothness of more classic Germanic varieties. Still, its a delicious American rendition to America's favorite fall beer style.",3.99
Oktoberfest,"Pours a gorgeous copper color with a creamy oatmeal colored beer that sticks around as a cap and provides moderate lacing. Beautiful beer, IMHO.

The nose features sharp caramel notes and biscuits as soon as the top is popped, and a nice wheat bread component that works really well.

The taste is led by the caramel flavor, and there’s a nice biscuit flavor and some bread that tamps down the sweetness. The mouthfeel is medium, but a bit soft and watery, which is a bit of a miss, IMHO.

This is still a worthy fall beer that I’ll enjoy through the 4-pack, but if that mouthfeel had been a bit more dialed in, this would be a “run back to the beer store for more” Marzen.",3.92
Oktoberfest,"Canned on 7/19/22 (best by 1/15/23); consumed on 9/13/22

Pours a clear, ruddy orange body capped with two fingers of fluffy, off-white foam; decent head retention yields a tinge of creamy cap, a large, frothy collar, and generous display of webby, soapy lacing strewn across the walls of the glass.

Aroma features a tinge of earthy spice into toasty honey and a brown bread undercurrent as spritzy minerality leans into soft bread dough over time.

Taste offers toasted malts and a prickly minerality, with a blunter burnt honeycomb mid-palate engaging flaky bread crusts on the back end as delicately charry bread dough finishes.

Mouthfeel brings a light body and a fluffy, moderate-high carbonation; cleanly textured into a pillowy peak through the mid-palate, a slight prickle trends dry into a refreshing finish.

A softly dispositioned Märzen, finding honeyed malt easing a light sweetness across a vaguely mineralic, largely airy foundation; a solid overall take on the style nonetheless.",3.63
Oktoberfest,"Coppery-orange with a white head.
The smell is an Oktoberfest smell with some light spice.

Oktoberfest,"Pours crystal clear and copper with modest head. However the retention and lacing are solid.

Firm bready aromas mix with judicious grassy hops.

Well balanced on the palate. Malty sweetness, but not over the top. Grassy and earthy hops for bitterness but not out of whack. A little fruitiness.

Poured into my pint glass this lager is a clear brassy amber shade with a cake like ecru colored head. Streams of bubbles rising.

Scent is caramel, bread dough and crisp herbal hops.

Taste is dry and spicy. There is a hint of caramel and some crackery or biscuity malt but the peppery earthy spice and herbal hop notes take center stage. Considerably more dry than sweet. Some tart apple notes appear as the beer warms.

Mouth is crisp and bracing. Surprisingly refreshing.

This is really an interesting marzen. Very dry and much less malty / sweet than most examples of the style. Refreshing and very easy to drink with a classic German style hop profile and nice clean finish. Very high drinkability. I love the subtlety and the crisp nature of this lager. Still think Ayinger and Hacker are my favorites but this is pretty high on my list .",4.2

S: Moderate aromas of caramel and toasted malts are present in the nose.
T: The taste follows the smell and has a light to moderate amount of bitterness.
M: It feels medium-bodied and a touch dry on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This lager doesn't seem to be as malty compared to others in the style and is quite easy to drink.

Medium mouthfeel, low bitterness, good carbonation from start to finish, and a crisp finish with a lingering hint of tart fruit on the palate. This is a good one, and an excellent pairing with all sorts of food. Highly recommended. Prost!",4.3
Oktoberfest,"In my continuing quest to try pretty much every Oktoberfest on the market, I found this one at my local liquor store, so I was glad to try it and knock another state off my list at the same time. I'd never heard of this brewery, but this is a solid beer, so I'd try other stuff from them in the future. This one is pretty bready and malty, which is how I like my Oktoberfests, but might be a touch too sweet for some. Still, it holds up well to ones I can get from my local tap rooms.",4.0

The taste is semisweet caramel malt up front with more traditional bread and noble hop notes coming after the swallow. Moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with average carbonation and a semi dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, good. I'd prefer way less sweetness and no caramel malt.",3.46
Oktoberfest,"Definitely a bit lighter than some of the heavier amber marzens. Packs a nice crackery wallop with a handful of zesty, earthy hops. Super refreshing and what I look for in an oktoberfest. Love the lightness, grassiness, slight bitterness and overall cracker flavor.

Very close behind Penn brewery oktoberfest as my favorite per style.",4.43
Festbier,"Appearance: Pours a clear, golden-hued body with an inch of so of white foam.

Smell: Sparsely grainy, bready with a subtly herbal bent.

Taste: Soft, lightly bready barley with a modest hint of honeyish sweetness. Herbal hops, a skosh spiceful and with a tiny touch of mint leaf. Lightly bitter. Lightly herbal, grainy on the finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Tolerable.",3.32
Festbier,"Clear, dark golden color, nicely carbonated, decently sized white head dissipates at average rate and leaves no lacing. Nose is very muted all around. This is the same with taste, very light but also clean. Not much to complain about. Average feel. I would definitely drink this lager again.",3.73
Festbier,"Clear golden-yellow, no head. Smell is lightly sweet with a touch of spice. Taste is heavier on spice: black pepper, clove, touch of hops. It's very sweet but easy to drink. I like it okay, easier to drink then their awful pumpkin brew... still very middling",2.97

Festbier,"12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug.

A little less than expected from Boston Beer, representative of style but average at best and falling well short of the best examples. Seemingly brewed not to offend making it another decent gateway beer from Sam but disappointing to my palate after drinking two German Festbiers earlier today.",3.17
Festbier,"Clear gold appearance with an average size white head. Grainy, malt focused aroma that does a good job of whetting my appetite with limited input from the hops. Taste of light toast, a tiny bit of yeast early on and more of a hop presence in the latter stages. Finishes on a spicy note. Medium bodied, decently carbonated mouthfeel.",3.98
Festbier,"12 ounce bottle poured into a pint glass. This Bostonian Festbier pours a bit more deep golden than typical and offers a light and brief cap of foam. Nose is grainy yet lacks much in the hops department. Touch of lemony hops with a spin.

Taste offers a malty yet subdued delivery for the style, lacking the depth of a typical malt bill. Decent feel yet not much depth as the malt is singular. Bit of spice on the finish. Just...bland.

Overall I usually like the Sam seasonals but this seems to be a work in progress. Good to see more festbiers in the States but this is undercarbonated and lacks malt depth and ends overly sweet and simple. Festbier like Pils is so simple to make yet nobody wants to make it Stateside without forcing two row into the mix. It doesn't work. Respect beer and respect beer styles.

Average out of respect. It's really not........",3.0

Look:
Golden yellow with a 4-finger (!) frothy and pillowy white head. The head slowly fades to about a half finger of bubbly foam. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Bready dough with a hint of lemon. Noticeable grassy and earthy hops.

Taste:
Lightly toasted bread and biscuity notes with touches of lemon. More malty than the aroma suggests. Notes of grass and earth are in the background. The sip dries a tad at the end. Nice.

Feel:
Crisp and clean. Body is medium-light.

Overall:
A decent and drinkable Festbier that is a nice companion to SA's Oktoberfest. This isn't my favorite Festbier but it is nicely done.",3.79
Festbier,"Appearance: A large, moderately coarse snow-white head with good retention. The medium golden body show a bit of haze, with clouds of fat bubbles drifting lazily to the surface. Scattered bits of foam adorn the glass wall.

Aroma: The aroma offers bread dough notes, cracker malts and pleasant noble hops.

Taste: At the opening, bready malt notes appear, soon followed by grassy and peppery hop flavors. A bit of sweetness presents later in the taste. Towards the finish, there is a mild wave of herbal bitterness, bringing the taste to a graceful close.

Mouth feel: Soft and full, very pleasant, with just a bit of soft carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: A fine example, perhaps a bit out of season for December, but, nonetheless, well done.

Presentation: Packaged in a custom twelve-ounce brown glass long neck bottle with a pry-off crown, served in a La Fin du Monde tulip.",3.75
Festbier,"12oz bottle

Pours about a finger of dense white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is very nice, with most of the head remaining after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks pretty nice as well. Body is a brilliant golden orange. Looks great so far.

Nose is a nice blend of cracker, and doughy-toasty notes, with a bit of malty sweetness. Smells great.

Flavor follows suit, although maybe even cleaner, and definitely fuller. That dough comes through wonderfully. Super clean, great flavor.

Even after a little while in the glass, the carbonation is still holding up well, medium-light. Body is pretty light but there is a small sweetness that adds a little depth. Bitterness is low, but definitely shows itself. Really a lovely, soft mouthfeel that accentuates that doughy sweetness.

Drinkability is super high, this is tasty and very well balanced.

Appearance turned out ok, the head faded and the lacing was subpar, but not bad all around.

This is what I want out of a Festbier, this has that extra doughy sweetness you need to separate the style from a more generic lager, something many Festbiers fail to do. Overall a great beer.",4.22
Festbier,"A deep golden color, darker than the previous Weihenstephan Festbier, but quite good looking - clear with plenty of tiny rising bubbles below a tall white thick head that has good retention, receding below a domed top.

The aroma grassy, bready, and earthy.

The taste is much better. Malty with a bit of brightening from the hops. Bread and a touch of caramel. It is, as the label says, very smooth and mild. Eminently drinkable, malty but not too sweet. It seems to me to be a bit of an in-between styles beer (i.e. between a Märzen and a Festbier rather than a true Festbier). I would guess Sam Adams was not wanting to stray too far from their very popular Oktoberfest.

The mouth feel is substantial, smooth, and creamy.

Overall, an enjoyable beer, one I could have several of in a ""session"", but lacking the crispness of the best festbiers I've had. Nevertheless, and we'll see how I feel after trying (for the first time) the Sam Adams Oktoberfest tomorrow, but I could see buying 6 packs of this. At this point, I'm sorry to have only 2 left. (The rating doesn't reflect very well how much I am enjoying drinking this beer.)",3.71
Festbier,"Pours a toasted straw color with honey highlights. Thin white head that settles quickly into a sparse cap.

Light grainy aroma. A bit of biscuit/dough.

That taste has that distinct Munich malt characteristics; a bit doughy with pepper spice. The hops sit in the background and provide a light grassy bitterness.

Light to moderate feel with tingly carbonation. Starts sweet on the palate but finishes with a dry grassy bitterness.

A good representation of a festbier. I like that it is a bit toasty.",3.68
Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"From a 16oz can, dated 07/25/22. Served in a willi becher pub glass.

Pours a crystalline caramel-copper with two-plus fingers of rocky suds. Retention is good, leaving robust streaks of foamy lacing. Colour-wise, it's sort of midway between what I'd expect a märzen and a festbier to look like.

Nose is bready-malty and somewhat reminiscent of a caramel apple.

Taste has more of a sharp, earthy bite to it than what I'd smelled. Tasting brown bread and apple, caramel, nuts, tea and tobacco. There may be a subtle, slightly sweet, pine needley aftertaste that’s hard to account for but only mildly discordant and really more of a curiosity than anything else.

Feel is smooth and slick, somewhat full bodied relative to the style with fine, tingly carbonation. A little more carbonation would have been welcome considering it’s heft.

Overall, a credible Oktoberfestbier. A somewhat Americanized take on the style - despite the claim of being ‘brewed with all German ingredients’ - but not outrageously so. It’s probably a little too thick if it were my intention to drink all four cans in one sitting. Not that that’s ever really my intention. It just sort of seems to happen.",3.74
Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"From the bottom of the can: ""2 B CANNED ON 08/2/22 14:25""

Appearance: The body is a golden-brown color with hints of burnt orange. It has good clarity with a light opalescence. The head is medium-large and has an off-white eggshell appearance with a fluffy and creamy textured surface that borders on rocky. It has pretty good retention. Not much in the way of lacing aside from a few spots.

Aroma: The aroma is of malts that are slightly bready with a light maillard character and a touch dusty. There are also hints of herbal hop notes.

Taste: Up front there are nutty and bread crust flavors. There is a touch of acorn and some light moss towards the middle with hints of tea leaves. Somewhat bitter tea leaf towards the back of the mouth. A bit of a charred note in the aftertaste which is a little odd.

Mouthfeel: It has a medium body with a semi-dry finish and a medium hop bitterness. Carbonation feels good. It is easy to drink.

Overall: For the most part the beer is good. I has a bit of an odd aftertaste and the aroma is a bit muted, but otherwise the flavors and aromas are good. The beer is very drinkable and that is one of its strongest suits. As a whole the beer was enjoyable and I could drink it again.

Decent solid Marzen. Finish is not as clean and crisp as my favorite German examples of the style. Though dryer and spicier this lager's tart apple, caramel notes and bready malt balance the spice.",3.71
Oktoberfest Märzen Lager,"Reliable brewery, reliably beer. Don't be put off by the Marzen categorization. I've bought this at least 4 or 5 years on the trot now and it's really more truly a middle ground between pure marzen (in the chewy, malty vein) and festbier (in the hoppier, spicier style). That said, it's a very reliable take and a good option at a good price point for a nice session.

There's some herbal bitterness to accompany a firm malt body, which is somewhat pronounced but well balanced. The nose is all Bavarian malt and hops, smells so wonderful. Taste is even keeled, nothing pulling one way or the other. Have to compliment the exceptional fining and conditioning - sharp clarity, fluffy head receding to a sort of pool of copper, looks wonderful.

Flavor is some caramel up front followed by a bit of bready malt and some light toasted notes. The toasted grain flavor lingers after each sip.

Oaktoberfest,"1.5 x 12 oz bottle
Glassware: 0.5 L Festmug


Look:
Clear very golden copper (more gold than copper). Head was initially 2 fingers of creamy off-white foam which then dissipated slowly to about 1/4 inch of the same.

Smell:
Light and almost crackery malts that is more in line with a helles (or pilsner) than a Marzen. There is a touch or 2 of grassy hops hiding in the background. No oak is detectable.

Taste:
Same as the nose. There is also some breadiness and a very very slight fruity note along with a metallic one.

Feel:
Smooth but wet and also watery. Body is light-medium (at best)

Overall:

I was curious about this one but I am let down by it. I was expecting a Märzen, but this is much more akin to a Festbier. I was surprised by the lack of detectable oak. The bottle was from last year (2021), so perhaps that is a factor. On the plus side it is quite drinkable. As a Festbier, this would actually be quite good and I would rate it higher - my ratings reflect this beer as an amber Märzen.

For reference, some of my favorite amber Märzens to date are Ayinger, Hacker-Pschorr, and Paulaner.",3.33
Oaktoberfest,"12oz bottle purchased off the shelf as a six-pack for $10.75 plus tax. Bottled on 07/15/22, so this is almost two months old.

Look: Pours a nice light copper color with perfect clarity. There was one-finger of off-white head that gradually reduced to a thin rim around the glass.

Smell: Nice aromas that you would expect from a Marzen - toasty, bready notes with spice and floral, earthy hops. It smells very clean and crisp. Overall, the beer smells malt forward and it also smells balanced.

Taste: Really delicious. Up front, it's bready and malty as suggested by the nose. The beer is light to medium bodied with gentle carbonation. I think the finish of this beer is the most distinctive part due to the oak lagering. The very subtle tannins and spice character of the oak barrel, along with the hops, really help to temper the maltiness of this beer so that it is a balanced and drinkable product. The finish is slightly chewy with lingering notes of bread crust, caramel, toasted oak, cocoa, and spice. I think that the oak barrels and the hop character help to make this beer finish relatively dry too. Very drinkable and enjoyable, I wouldn't mind knocking back a few of these in a row.

Feel: I would say that this has a slightly lighter body than most other Marzens that I have had recently. While I think that other Marzens tend to be closer to medium bodied, this one is light to medium bodied with gentle carbonation. At 5.2% ABV, I think that is a fitting body and mouthfeel for this beer.

Overall: This is probably one of the tastier American-made Marzens that I have had in a while. It's easy to drink and presents a nice combination of malty, hoppy, and drinkability.

The result is a classic German Fest Bier with a hint of West Coast hoppiness. Grab your stein, don your lederhosen and enjoy!",4.18
Oaktoberfest,"Bottle. White head. Little lace. Autumn gold color. Clear.

Malty, honey, toasted crackers, biscuit. A bit of sweetness. Grassy and zesty hops. Not really picking up much oak.

Solid flavor and done to style. Very enjoyable.",3.75
Oaktoberfest,"The pour is straw colored with a moderate amount of carbonation. On the taste I'm getting a well pronounced lemon note, some white pepper, along with some white bread. I'm picking up on the oak as the beer warms up a bit, this was an interesting version of a marzen & would pair well with mild/medium strength cigar. Cheers! B-",3.3
Oaktoberfest,"More hops and less sweet than 99% of märzens, which is a huge plus in my book. Not sure where the oak enters, but I'm even less sure if I care. This is great",4.49
Oaktoberfest,"12oz bottled 07/22/22 (1 month ago) poured into a mug at fridge temp 5.2% ABV per label. The beer pours bright golden amber with off white head. The head recedes to a thin ring and uneven cap. Sparce spots of lacing. The aroma is mild with rich malt and a hint of oak. The taste is semisweet caramel malt with a quick hitting, mild oak and earthy hop combo that knock the sweetness right down. Mild to moderate bitterness. The mouthfeel is thin bodied with average carbonation and a mostly dry finish. Cleanly lagered. Overall, good. This is a clean, straightforward American oktoberfest. Not too sweet and quite drinkable.",3.57
Oaktoberfest,"Don’t really detect the oak so much. Very smooth. Not as sweet as most Märzen’s. Super drinkable though,nice color. Overall very pleasant and not overly sweet, or over hopped like many West coast takes on European beers.
It’s Good!",3.87
Oaktoberfest,"Clear golden ale with a big head that slimmed but persisted as a foamy cap... Oaky and slightly sweet, medium-bodied, with ample chewy grains and mild hops... Thought it was really enjoyable, perhaps a bit off for a purist, but very smooth and woody with a honeyed edge... Got two for trying, may pick up more... Certainly worth a try if you like the Octoberfest beers and their like...",4.0
Oaktoberfest,"A thin, off-white head floats above the almost clear, dark golden amber beer. Minimal to no lace forms on a Pretentious Glass Company dimpled mug.

The aroma is sweet with light graininess. There is a faint suggestion of oak against light toast with honey.

This is more bitter than I had expected, however, the bitterness is far from strong. Sweetness follows. In general, the flavor is less interesting than I had expected. In particular, there are no wood flavors. The finish is mild and long.

The body is medium to full with a hard, smooth texture. Slight metallic notes accentuate light astringency. Alcohol is as expected, barely noticeable. Carbonation in light and fizzy.

While this is a decent beer, I found nothing shines. Octoberfests do tend to be less flashy than other styles. However, I had expected the oak would be more pronounced and add some excitement.",3.69
Oaktoberfest,"Look: Clear amber-orange with a lively off-white head that builds quickly and eventually settles to a lid, leaving good lacing behind
Aroma: Warm brown bread, melanoidin, oak notes, some earthy hops, and toffee
Taste: Toffee, melanoidin, and earthiness kick it off and quickly followed by waves of bready malt that pile up and join into the mix. Oak is present throughout and closes with the duo of bread and earthy hops
Mouthfeel: Full, very clean throughout, medium-high carbonation, and smooth, clean and soft but crisp on the finish
Overall: This is a delightful beer. This is my second time with this beer and didn’t see it last year but I feel like this is better than what I had two years ago and I liked that one too - apparently this year’s one is now actually oak-aged so that is probably why. The oak adds a nice layer to the Okto base and I’m a huge fan of using oak in/on/with beer so not too surprised I liked that aspect as well. Overall, a tasty Marzen that hits the spot on this cool evening",3.98
Oaktoberfest,"This one is a little more delicate than I expected, restrained. Balanced but I get a bit more hop than malt which for me throws this one a bit off from expectations.",3.62
Oaktoberfest,"Clear golden amber body with a white head. Aromas of oak with toasty malts, flowers, and bread dough. Taste is much the same, toast and oak naturally pair, dough, caramel malt, german yeast, and flowers round out well. Moderately crisp, decent carb, malty and oaky through out the whole sip. Nice twist with the oak",4.04
Oaktoberfest,"Bavarian-style marzen with an oakey twist. Deep gold pour, biscuit nose and grain flavor. Malty at first and throughout. This brew captures Bavarian simplicity and grace.",3.5
Oaktoberfest,"Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. Pours deep orange yellow with a small white head. Smells of caramelized grain with slight fruit notes. Tastes of sweet caramelized grain with a tad bit of fruit. Beer is light bodied and easy drinking, good carbonation. Overall, a very good beer.",3.77
Oaktoberfest,"12 oz bottle, dated 7/20/21. Parish Pint Glass.

Has a beautiful light amber glow, skewing strawberry-blonde, with a creamy buttered head of 1 finger. Leaves lace as it recedes. Marvelous!

Aroma brings me back to the days of reviewing my first beers on here. Same time of year, too. Wet mash, toasted grain, some hop sharpness rounding it all out...some deeper descriptors I wouldn't have picked up on back then would be apricot, caramel, crisp apple, and flower bed.

Man it's been awhile since I've had a good Marzen. This one was a great re-entry. Lots and lots of toasty, crisp munich and caramunich malts open this up, creating a bed for herbal hops and dry grass. Lemon peel and slight citrusy brine wrap up the finish.

Carbonated feel with slight parch and moderate to strong resins. Alcohol is detectable at only 5.2% but it's permissible as appropriate warmth since certain areas of the world would be experiencing colder temperatures already at the end of September.

Overall, a very delightful take on the Marzen and one I'd be glad to have again. I wish we got Firestone Walker here in South Dakota, but I suppose like all other breweries their stuff would sit and rot as very few people buy beer here.

I would buy it again should I be within FW distro around Sept-Oct.

$1.66 @ Binny's in Peoria, IL",3.99
Oaktoberfest,"Poured from a bottle. Golden in color with a white head and a little lacing. Smells of malt, bread, caramel and honey. Flavor follows the smell and all comes together nicely. Flavor is very good, exactly what you want in an Octoberfest beer.",4.13
Oaktoberfest,"Poured into a tulip pint. This looks really nice.

L: 4. Light marzen coloration. Polished copper. Ample carbonation with a lingering head.
S: 3.75. Give it a few minutes and it really opens up at you. Malty. Spicy. There's a honey like sweetness to it but that dissipates as it breathes.
T: 4.25. My favorite of the season so far. It has a nice spicy bite to it.
F: 4. I think the oak aging worked wonders. Nice and smooth. Light and mellow mouthfeel.
O: 4. A solid 4. It doesn't fill you up like other Marzens might. Very good oktoberfest lager.",4.04
Oaktoberfest,"Brassy gold tone, ample foam and spotty lacing. Aroma is malt forward and grainy.

Taste is malty and easygoing, light crackery grains and a hint of apple. The oak is very understated, but it’s there. Lighter feel but still fairly substantial. Good carb level, smoothly textured. Overall pretty solid, lighter and less sweet than most American Märzens.",4.0
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500mL can purchased off the shelf as part of a 4-pack for $11.99.

Look: Pours a crystal clear golden color with a fluffy white head. Looks like a ""textbook"" beer.

Smell: Subtle fruity/estery/floral aromas balanced with grassy hop character. There is a crackery, doughy malt presence too. Notes of a pale, floral honey as well.

Taste: This is very crushable. It has a very pleasant flavor and a nice body. You would expect a beer that is this pale to be relatively light in body. However, this beer is probably closer to medium bodied because it has a rich maltiness akin to a Helles lager. It has a lovely toasted grain flavor. On the finish, which is mildly to moderately bitter, I get notes of white grape must. The beer is super crisp and clean. It's hard to believe that this beer is 6.0% ABV. It would be very easy to drink a lot of this beer.

Feel: The mouthfeel is really nice - it's perfectly carbonated and it is close to medium bodied. The beer is crisp, clean, and very refreshing.

Overall: This is my first time consuming a beer in the Festbier style. It's fitting that my first one is from Paulaner, who popularized the Festbier style. This is very different from Oktoberfest Marzen, which I am much more familiar with. I enjoyed this one and look forward to trying other Festbier examples from other breweries!",3.94
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Very solid representative of the style. Looks exactly as it should, with its big fluffy head and clear golden color. Smells pleasantly of noble hops. Flavors are very well balanced between doughy malt, hops that are assertive but not aggressive, all supported by the yeast. Mouthfeel is a shade heavier than I expected, satisfying without overwhelming. Overall, a highly drinkable beer that doesn't get boring.",4.27
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"This is a very nice beer. What can I say that haven’t been said about it yet? Smooth, yes we know, hoppy, sure, well, balanced, hell yeah!
There is something about its taste that you could drink again and again and again - guess that is why they made this the Oktoberfest Bier. Some lagers might have strange hops, excessive yeasty overtone or are too heavy on malts and therefore are too sweet - and these make a beer less easy to drink. But when it comes to the Oktoberfest, it is all about drinking beers by the gallon so it had better be a good one and an easy drinker! Well, THIS is that one! Now all what is missing is a plane ticket to Munich, the timing would be right though… A legendary, amazingly drinkable beer.",4.17
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Golden straw colour, slightly on the darker side with a three finger white head. Smell is big, rich, bready malt, fresh cut grass, a nice peppery note, with some alcohol presence. The taste begins with that nice doughy, bready malt, then gives way to quite noticeable ethanol, and finishes with gentle but interesting grassy and subtly spicy hops and more liquid bread. The carbonation is quite gentle for a lager, which makes it smoother and easier to drink, but the alcohol is noticeable in the smell and taste, which is a slight complaint for me. Overall a tasty, drinkable Festbier, with nice flavours and a smooth medium body. My only minor gripe is the ethanol note is not hidden as well as it is in some other beers that have just as high or higher ABV, but that's forgivable and it's not that bad anyway. Solid beer, recommended.",4.16
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Appearance: Brilliant, clear gold. Frothy thick head with excellent retention

Aroma: Floral and grainy

Flavor: Spicy hops. Sweet start to finish. Low bitterness. Short semi-dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied, soft and creamy. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Has lower bitterness than most German Festbiers. Also comes in a little lighter. Plenty of malty flavor and floral hops aroma. Moderate level of carbonation. Very soft and creamy on the tongue. Very conducive to drinking in large quantities.",4.69
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Fresh liter can poured into a half liter glass mug. Pour is a clear light golden in color with a rich cap of white foam. Hazes up a bit after the pour then clears again. Good retention and soapy lacing.

Nose of light spice and lemon hop notes muddled with some bready malts. Taste follows and with a long simple but pleasant bready malt finish. Touch of citric sweetness permeates, touch oily on the finish. Second half poured into the liter 'stein' as intended. Feel is a bit thinner than expected but still a good festbier. Overall a bit of false sweetness and lighter bodied than some you might find at Therese's meadow. I preferred the Lowenbrau, cheers. Yet then, with some warming, it does seem to fire on all cylinders......",3.99
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Poured into seidel. Fine Munich gold body, white sudzy head.

Nose is cracker malt delight.

Taste follows. Bready but light, grassy hops snuck within.

Feel is exactly what you want with a fat cheesy pretzel bite.

Classic Festbier. You see this pint in the wild get it and drink.",4.43
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"The taste is all malt with just a touch of spice (maybe hops???) while the *aftertaste* is sweet baked bread along with a bowl of mixed nuts, very malty - I said M.A.L.T.Y.",3.81
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Big ass liter can was poured into its respective stein. That looked really cool. This definitely tastes good and is typical for the style. I wouldn't say it stood out though other than maybe a ""spiciness"" as it warmed. Overall fun beer.",3.78
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500 ml Can
Consumed on: 14 July, 2022; 30 Aug, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 45.5 F


Look:
Bright golden yellow with a 2-finger frothy and foamy white head. The head lasts ands lasts. And lasts. As is slowly dissipates it leaves excellent lacing on the sides of my fest mug.

Smell:
Bready and biscuity malts. Touch of sweet but slightly zesty lemon. Mild floral and grassy hops.

Taste:
Things start off with some tingly and zesty hops, then lemon and lemon rind shows up followed by sweet bready malts with a touch of honey. The hops provide a mild bitterness throughout the sip which dries out as it end.

Feel:
Soft and clean. A tad chewy. Body is light-medium.

Overall:
A very easy-drinking and quaffable Oktoberfest beer that is actually (and, to me, surprisingly) refreshing. I can certainly see this beer being consumed in great quantities at festivals. I am having this in the evening after a bit of a hot day (in the 90s) with some humidity and the beer is drinking very well. I haven't had many Festbiers to date, but this seems a pretty solid representation of the style. And, if I recall, it was one of the first Festbiers that I ever came across.

I have seen some comparison of this beer to an amped us Helles. I disagree. To me this beer is more like a slightly amped up Dortmunder Export.",3.96
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Purchased a gift set on sale after Oktoberfest. Import from Germany. Liter-sized can poured into the big mug included in the set.

Appearance: Bright, straw yellow, with a huge, foamy, and tenacious head.

Smell: Banana bread, Wheaties, malted milk. Mild-mannered and sweet.

Taste: True to style, as expected. Malt is the main focus here. Initial sharp bite, but then sweet. Dinner rolls, unsalted peanuts, creamed corn, Twinkies. No bitterness, just a warm, almost buttery finish and a delicious aftertaste, again with those buttery notes.

Mouthfeel: Thin body, but pleasantly sticky and remaining on the tongue.

Overall: Great, mellow beer, just what you want from an Oktoberfest brew. Goes well with anything and is easily, happily consumed in large quantities.",3.94
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Poured from 11.2 oz bottle to a .5L stein. Color is clear gold. A white head falls quickly to a light cap. A lot of carbonation bubbles rising up through the body. Smell is malty, bready, a bit of honey. Taste starts with a balance between bready, doughy malt and herbal hops. Middle leans a bit more toward hops with a nice bitter kick that transitions to a finish with more bready, almost yeasty, flavors. Feel is medium-light body, good carbonation that cleans up your palate. Overall, this is a great beer that goes down easy during Oktoberfest ""season"". Pairs well with all the classic Oktoberfest foods too. Really enjoyed.",4.21
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,Can pour- clear yellow/gold straw color with thick white head leaving significant frosty lacing. Nose is sweet malt with grassy floral notes Taste follows with a crisp almost dry finish.,3.89

Clear light gold color. Three fingers fine white head.
Bread, pepper, grassy, light floral scents.
Honey, light citrus, rye, light mineral flavor notes.
Smooth, strong carbonation, dry finish.
Delighted to see this in cans. Very enjoyable.",4.37
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Appearance: Pours a clear, light golden color with a moderate white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of pale malts, bread malts, only hints of toast. Smooth and somewhat bready. (3.50)

Flavor: Strong flavors of upfront of toasted pale malts and honey. An earthy and floral flavor of Munich malts. A pale bready malt finish. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied and low to moderate carbonation. Leaves a sweet feel on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Paulaner Oktoberfest Marzen 10/28/21: Pours a lighter color. Milder aromas. More bready, pale malts. Less toasty and woodsy Christmas tree pine.

Overall: A fantastic and authentic festbier. This one nails the toasted pale malts, honey and earthy Munich malt flavors. Allows the flavors to shine through since this one is in a can. Sometimes these are bottled and often light-struck and skunked. However, this is excellent. (Final Rating: 3.99)",3.99
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"This is Paulaner's second Oktoberfest offering - see Oktoberfest Marzen for the other one. This one is a bit less malty I think, which was a surprise when I saw that it was 6% ABV. I like my Oktoberfest beers to be very biscuity and malty, so this one was a little light for me in the flavor department. Not bad, just not as much oomph as I prefer.",3.9
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500ml can into a pint glass. Canned 3/22/21, best by 3/22/22.

Looks decent in the glass. Crystal clear pale golden yellow body. The initial big white head shrinks to a ring and faint covering. A little lacing.

Strong aroma. Malty, grainy, even a little caramel.

On tasting, malty, bready, a little dry. The caramel lingers around. Somehow crisp but not clean.

Mouth medium, finish malty and drying.

Overall, not bad, just a little odd when compared to other recent festbiers. Perhaps 7 months in the can is the issue here.",3.73
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Bought the gift pack with a Maas glass and 1l can of Oktoberfest bier. Note to Paulaner, please sell this in the can at retail, I hate wasting three bottles for a Maas. This is rich, malty and sweet taking you on a nice journey. The hops have bright floral notes that balance the sweet malt without the bitterness desired by hopheads. Really drinkable at 6% and really nice for the style. Get some and make the darn cans available already.",4.0
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Appearance - clear golden body with white head

Smell - slight toffee, spicy hops, toasted grains

Taste - toasted grains, white bread, slight toffee/honey, biscuit

Mouthfeel - medium plus bodied, medium carbonation, slight sweetness upfront, malty, toasted feel in the back, easy to drink, crisp and refreshing


Overall - really good representation of the Weisn style of octoberfest. Definitely worth a try.

Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"500ml can poured into a dimpled mug.
Canned 3/22/21

Pouring crystal clear and rich gold, @6 SRM, it is topped with near two fingers of white persistent foam that leaves lacing. This is a lively pour with masses of tiny, rising bubbles replenishing a head that lessens but never disappears. The moderate strength nose is also persistent featuring sweet bready malt along with spicy Noble hop aromas.

Delivering big but clean and balanced flavor front to back, it is semi-sweet with mild bitterness. Tasting bready with sweeter grains, spicy and light floral flavors. Mouthfeel is medium weight, soft and mildly creamy with lightly crisp edges coming from medium carbonation. Well rounded, easy drinking and very enjoyable. Great Festbier.",4.33
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Pours a clear yellow with soft, soapy head.

Smell is bready and a bit grainy with notes of citrus, crackers, rye bread and a floral hint.

Taste is bready and a bit grainy, clean and crisp with a solid bitterness. Notes of citrus, rye, toast and some spiciness.

Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and well carbonated.

Overall, a very well made, tasty lager.",4.25
Oktoberfest (Wiesn) Bier,"Poured from an enormous can at fridge temp into a giant Paulaner mug. Pours a nice golden transparent yellow. Good amount of white head that goes away within a minute.

Nose: Oranges, wheat, grass, crisp corn,

Taste: Super smooth. Sweet upfront, but a definite hoppy bitterness on the back end. Orange peel, grass, bread, a touch of spice, and a floral note. Very enjoyable.

Mouthfeel and overall: Light and crisp. Very refreshing. Overall, a very nice drinkable beer. As far as Oktoberfest beers go, this would land somewhere in the middle for me.",3.89
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,Gold in color with a hazy complexion and some moderate sized sediment suspended within the body. There’s a quarter inch of dishwater white on top. Moderate soapy lacing. The aroma is of citrus. I’m tasting sharply bitter orange. The mouth is smooth and there’s a pronounced hop burn that lingers after you swallow.,3.73
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"I made an account JUST to comment on this DISGUSTING brew. This is the most horrendous flavored beer I have EVER tasted! Who on EARTH thought this was a good idea???Each gulp I had to fight gagging, and wound up pouring the entire 6 pack (or eleven bucks) down the drain. DISCONTINUE THIS BLEND. IT IS VAPID! YUCK! Voodoo can be a bit bitter to begin with, but mixing with orange like that was a poor tastebud choice. You aren't BLUE MOON. IT IS HORRID!",1.06
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Very surprised at the extreme citrus flavors, but it's an IPA with Natural Flavors.
Nice white head that lasts, no grit (grit doesn't bother me, this didn't have any) for a smooth feel. And 9.5% ABV.
I'll have another, please.",4.06
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Hazy straw color with a creamy white head that clings to the glass, this beer smells like an orange creamsicle. Literally.

It also tastes like an orange creamsicle, with no hint of alcohol, quite the feat in a 9.5% ABV beer. The mouthfeel is medium and on the softer side.

I wouldn’t want two pints of this (that would become cloying, IMHO), but one stovepipe of the beer works just fine.",4.02
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Poured into a tall clear pint glass. Hazy yellow with more than a finger's worth of fluffy white head, good retention and lacing.

Tropical and citrus notes come to mind firstly. Notes of orange sherbet, Hawaiian Punch, orange, mango, pineapple, papaya, multi-grains, corn, and resin.

Tastes pretty much like what the aroma suggests. Body is medium light to medium.",4.0
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"its crazy how bad voodoo imperial is, i mean relatively speaking for what these guys are capable of, so i didnt expect a whole lot from this one, given it plays in a similar space. i was lucky enough to have to on draft rather than from the huge can where the bottom half is almost always assuredly rough unless you just blast it down, so that might be a factor here, but this is actually impressively good, even if i kind of hate to admit it because ive held a grudge against voodoo imperial for some time now, one of the worst beers in that single serve strong ipa space, despite tearing it up some how in terms of sales, who drinks more than one or two of those ever?! anyway, this is a different breed, thankfully. its almost nuts how strong it is, because it drinks light. its got some light unfiltered sort of chill haze to it, not big and starchy and thick, nor is it amber, like a lot of these are, not over malty for balance, smart call, seems like maybe some white wheat with the pale barley, real simple, big enough in stature but dry and light in flavor, even uplifting, it accentuates rather than balances out the hops in the taste too, cool. the hop profile rules, and tastes about as good as it smells, juicy is an understatement, with ripe mango and cantaloupe to it, but shockingly not sugary, love how clean the ferment is, not metallic, fusel, or even all that warm to me. playful hints of coconut, papaya, and sweet orange, really fruity, almost seems like it has to be fruit, but lots of new school hops in here, southern hemisphere maybe, and seemingly a lot of strains, no expense spared? good for these guys, especially because this is still affordable. no bitterness, but i dont miss it this time around, and i think this has great flavor, freshness, and dangerous drinkability, summer but good for any time, a good morning beer, mimosa vibes here too, just really fruity and good. high carbonation makes it quite light to drink. i dont know why i expected to dislike this, i used to love everything these guys made, its only recently my impression has turned, largely thanks to the imperial voodoo, this is totally redeeming. really tasty and well made, a standout in an increasingly crowded style space and format. call a spade a spade, this rules.",4.0
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"It looks like a killer hazy ipa, but smells and tastes like an alcoholic V8 splash. If that sounds good at all you will probably like this one. Also the 9.5 abv makes this a good bargain beer. It almost feels wrong calling it a beer though.",4.0
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"19.2 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 6/1/22, best before 12/4/22. Pours moderately hazy golden yellow color with a 2 finger dense and rocky off white head. Great spotty soapy lacing and streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Amazing juiced aromas up front of candied orange slices/juice, vanilla, lemon, passion fruit, pineapple, mango, melon, white grape, apricot. The taste follows much of the same suit with mandarin orange slices, vanilla, lemon, peach, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, grape, coconut, berries, citrus peel/rind, pepper, pine, wheat, white bread dough, herbal, floral, grass, yeast earthiness. Light-moderate pine, citrus rind, herbal, spicy bitterness on the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; balanced creamy/bready malts and sticky/resinous hops in the mouthfeel. Long drying resin finish, with a bit of spicy alcohol that gets a bit boozy after the finish, warming 9.5% is well showcased. A pretty wide variety of hops with Mosaic, Chinook, Pahto, Galaxy, Strata, Lotus, and Sabro. I have never had Pahto or Lotus. The creamsicle nose is pretty wild; everything comes together so well in the nose, as I was almost certain fruit was harmed in the making of this beer. The taste has more dank/earthiness on the hops, with the alcohol being a bit harsh, but certainly not too out of the ordinary for the gravity. It was very smooth for the ABV. I'd totally get more of these stovepipes or a 6 pack.",4.25
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Looks fine, on the dark size for haze. Aroma is overripe citrus. More overripe fruit in the taste, with the high alcohol also pervasive. Medicinal and difficult to drink.",2.69
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"straight boozy orange juice with a dash of grapefruit juice; very little hop bitterness to it, and the high abv is totally hidden, but there is a slightly medicinal tinge to it which may slow you down a little.
makes for an interesting entry point for those who typically dislike IPAs and want the benefits of a high abv brew.
as an IPA lover, I kinda hate it, and feel like it sets the style back a tad, imagining a future which sees more ""IPAs"" like this saturating the market. on the other hand, this is nothing short of a great party beer, making for a cheap ticket to buzz town.

not really the hill I'll choose to die on, but would be pretty sad to see the popularity of this brew take the shelves by storm.",3.79
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,This ain’t your hipster’s IPA! It tastes great without the slightest hint of pine cone hoppyness. It’s has a great grapefruit citrus flavor. The take is more astringent and light. This is the IPA that you want to get drunk with. There’s a depth and a full bodied flavor; not over powering the other. It goes down easy and you need to watch out for that! Classy from New Belgian!,4.63
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Quite possibly the worst ""juicy"" IPA or rather any IPA I've ever had. Tastes like children's orange-flavored aspirin. I'll reluctantly finish the 6'er and never go back.",1.26
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"Purchased a 6'er and have tried this twice. Both times I could not finish it. It tastes like pulp free pineapple/orange juice with a 9.5% ABV. The second time i tried it I did a side by side with another imperial pale ale - 90 Minute by Dogfish Head. There are no comparisons that can be made between them. I paid the same price for the 6'er of Juice Force as I did the 4 pack of 90 Minute, but will say the quality and value of 90 Minute far exceeds that of the Juice Force.",2.68
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,This was hard to drink. Had to pour out remaining 1/5th if it. Tastes like it was made in an artificial flavoring lab. For the price ( $4) there are better options.,2.8
Voodoo Ranger Juice Force IPA,"The Voodoo Ranger Juice Force is not just a silly beer, with an eye popping ABV and a name that is reminiscent of a poor drum and bass MC freestyling their way down a tricky couplet. No, it's a way of life.

That way of life is regret of missed birthdays, fearful of calls from the bank manager and lack of recollection of lifes wonder moments. Yes, it certainly packs a punch, akin to Mike Tyson, and with similar disregard to concepts such as consent, gut health and clarity of value judgements. As Britney Spears once sang, It came in like a wrecking ball. A shame said wrecking ball, also resulted in colleteral damage to my marriage. I can only see the kids every other weekend, but I am a Voodoo Ranger of the Juice Force 7 days a week, and for that, I am grateful to New Belgium Brewing Company. A highly satisfactory beverage and would reccomend to friend and foe.",3.3

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Smells good and then it goes downhill. Fast. Like a bobsled.

Looks - Clear orange/yellow body / bubbly.

Smell/Taste: Cinnamon, ginger and spice that hits the back of the throat with a burn.

It’s odd and not in a good way. It is literally spicy beer. Maybe a good taster but not a pint.

Not impressed.",2.31
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I poured a 12 oz. can into a pint glass. nice amber orange color, a one-inch head that receded quickly, typical of the style. The nose is nice, pumpkin, caramel, and vanilla waft above the fainter smell of cinnamon and allspice. This taste is initially as expected... some evidence of pumpkin mash, vanilla and caramel, cinnamon allspice, cloves, ginger.. but then the taste grows hotter. It is peppery, and seems perhaps heavy on the ginger, and after several sips, you realize it's time to call the fire department, and start looking for water. I'm not sure why they have gone so spicy on the taste, but for me it is truly unwelcome. As for the mouthfeel, I am never comfortable when a campfire has been lit in the middle of my tongue.

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Notes as Written 09/17/2022
clear orange/yellow body, bubbly half finger head which dissipates fast, bubbley, takes coaxing to stir up aroma which is very subtle ginger, very strong cinnamon/ginger flavor which immediately hits the back of the throat with a burn, tastes good and is literally spicy, spicy beer not really my thing, but I can see the draw, smooth mouthfeel that develops a hard kick",2.8
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"""Enjoy by 8/6/23""; drank 9/13/22 @ the Yarchives.

See-through orange appearance.

A rough pour yielded a nice, noisy eggshell head; decent lace.

Pumpkin & chili pepper spice notes in the nose.

Medium thin mouthfeel.

Mild pumpkin & hot chili pepper bite flavors; as the drink progresses, the heat builds & you can't really taste much.

Not sure why chili beers exist, but this isn't an argument for them.",2.9
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Pours a clear pumpkin orange with a tinge of amber and mild effervescence. Scent has clear notes of pumpkin and cinnamon (almost smells like cinnamon Life cereal) , but the spicy notes are pretty muted. Taste is pretty smooth pumpkin and cinnamon before a transition to a strong spicy burn. Feel is on the lighter side with most of the aftertaste consumed with the spicy (presumably haberno) flavor. The individual parts are fairly hit or miss but dang, do I enjoy the overall combination and the interesting twist on the pumpkin variety.",3.86

Appearance – 3.5
First pour – Pale Gold (SRM 4), clear.

Lacing – Good. Wide band of impending torn curtains, with many medium bubbles.
Aroma – 3 – Vegetal with no hint of pumpkin, no hops, no malt, no yeast, no cinnamon.
Flavor – 3 – A bit sweet with instant pepper mouth burn, no flavors of malt, yeast, hops, nor pumpkin. Any cinnamon present is lost in the assortment of chilis. No ethanol (6.4% ABV, as marked on container) taste or aroma; however, there is no gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3 – Medium, watery, soft carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3. Looks good but aroma and taste-wise, it’s just another chili beer.",3.03

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"12 ounce can poured into a tulip.

L: Amber and clear, one inch white creamy head, leaves a little lace and fades to a perpetual ring in a couple of minutes
S: Big malty bread at the pour, this fades leaving a mostly spicy aroma, cinnamon, coriander, yeast, after warming a pastry bread aroma comes out
T: Malt and spice forward, coriander, clove, hot pepper, bread, wheat, hot peppery bite to finish, not getting any pumpkin
F: Medium body is smooth and creamy, finish is dry and rather clean for a spicy beer, has some warmth
O: Not bad, too much pepper for my taste, more like a chili beer than a pumpkin/seasonal spice beer",3.67

Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I'm not going to bother writing up a full breakdown of this beer as there isn't much to say besides why? It's pretty much a run of the mill pumpkin without much complexity. But yet your throat burns like you are dealing with a cold. I have to wonder if NB decided to toss in the peppers to distract you from the fact on how mediocre this is. I just don't get it as the chili's add absolutely nothing to the flavor profile. I mean if you want to make this ""something"" make it hot enough to make you sweat. That way you can give it to your buddy's in a glass without warning.

Anyhow I love NB's lineup, in fact they make some of my favorite beers (Trippel). But this is just depressing.",2.68
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium golden to orange color that is madly bubbling and a strong and creamy white head. SRM of 7. (3.75)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of fall spices upfront including cinnamon and cloves. Then it follows with some sweet apple pie and pumpkin pie crust malty aromas. (3.75)

Flavor: Moderate flavors upfront of fall spices including cinnamon and cloves. The malts are apple pie and pumpkin pie crust. Then in the middle the spicy pepper comes through. It doesn't stop. The spicy pepper carries through the end leaving a spicy bite through the finish. (3.75)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Strong carbonation. The spiciness comes through the middle and wipes through the end scorching any flavors in the beer and leaving them with a spicy pepper note. (3.50)

Overall: Not a huge drinker of pumpkin/flavored beers and cautiously headed toward this one given the words ""atomic"", ""spicy"", and ""pumpkin"". I can say the beer drinks quite well. The spices and malt flavors are well done with nice fall flavors of apple and pumpkin pie. The spiciness is definitely interesting and not subtle by any means. Cleans through the end and rips the palate. I can say it's better than many flavored/pumpkin beers I've had but sort of like a jalapeno, I don't think I would/could have more than one. (Final Rating: 3.78)",3.78
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Drinking this at The Parting Glass Pub in downtown Andrews NC.
Poured from a tap into a pint glass.
Looks orangish with a nice foamy head that dropped quickly to a very thin ring.
Smells lightly cinnamon, bready, spicy, pumpkin.
Taste follows the nose, WOW! Pepper, pepper, pepper on the back of palate.
That being said, there's a lot going on here, very complex. Pepper is all over the place some sips pepper, some sips more cinnamon. However the pepper builds on your palate and if you don't like pepper? You won't like this beer.
There is a bit of vanilla as well.
Mouth feel, falls short here, this is a beer that would've benefitted from a stronger malt base.
Overall this is a Pumpkin beer unlike any I've ever had, unusual, complex, spicy. A little more malt would've made this the greatest pumpkin beer ever.
Cheers!",4.12
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"On tap in a standard pint glass.

Orange copper color with a thin white cap that morphs to heavy lacing.

Cinnamon, nutmeg, crisp pumpkin Autumn aroma.

Liquid pumpkin pie flavor. Lots of cinnamon loaded malt.

Light and sweet and spicy. Then the lasting peppered finish, spicy hot.

As pumpkin beers go, it’s a cut above the norm for me. I enjoyed its easy drinking at 6.4% abv with the habenero kick.",3.88
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"This one smells like cinnamon first and then pumpkin and beer. The spicy cinnamon is strong.

So much cinnamon flavor with a little pumpkin all in a really malty beer.

The body is thin and the carbonation is moderate. The finish is mind blowing. Cinnamon and heat from chilies. It's so good.

Wow this is unique to me. It has some pumpkin but it's more of a spicy cinnamon beer. Overall I give it a 4.7 out of 6.",3.93
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"I was really excited about this one, I love NB and always seek out a few pumpkin spice beers every year when the seasons are changing. Also- I’ve been brewing spicy beers lately and really love them.

This is one of the worst beers I’ve had in a long time. The feel is thin and unsatisfying, and combined with an overwhelming sweetness it feels like drinking a soda. Pumpkin spice flavor completely overwhelms, so the flavor becomes completely one-dimensional and really leaves almost nothing recognizably beer-y in terms of flavor. As for the spicy notes, they’re almost non-existent except as an annoying tingle in the back of your throat. I actually forgot it was spiced until I read the can again. Color is fine, nice amber but the head is so weak as a result of thin sugary consistency.

Overall, I’ll never buy this or probably any other pumpkin spice beer ever again. I could only stomach one of the 6 and gave the rest to a homeless man.",2.35
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"From the can, it pours a clear orange amber color with a nice off-white head that lasts and leaves lacing. In the nose, fall spices and peppers predominate. The mouth gets some pumpkin spice goodness, along with the bite of the chilies. Interesting interpretation.",3.78
Voodoo Ranger Atomic Pumpkin,"Look: amber with orange tint, near white head that dissipates quickly.

Smell: fall smell with pumpkin spices, peppers interestingly intertwine with the spices giving off a spicy scent. Overall a fall hot tamale is the best way to describe it.

Taste: starts off like a regular spiced pumpkin beer a la Schlafly Pumpkin Ale lite, then turns up the heat with the peppers that singes for a few moments until creamy pumpkin pie filling cuts through the peppers for a smooth finish.

Feel: medium body that is fairly smooth. The peppers do offer a throat hit akin to smoking a cigar or more accurately a juul. The pepper throat hit does build up if you drink quickly so keep that in mind when consuming. Has a pepper/squash backbone so if vegetables in your beer weird you out this probably isn’t for you.

Overall: unique and delicious. Moderately spicy, good for the average person. People who eat peppers daily or avoid spicy food like the plague shouldn’t expect to see this drink in the same light. Definitely going to be a staple in my fridge every fall from here on out the spicy fall combination is something I never knew I needed in my life. Best served ~10 degrees below room temp imo.",4.84
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Nice big head, direct pour into pilsner urquell .5l mug. Clean, clean, and clean. Almost too clean. Pretty good but i just don't appreciate the high price for the small shipping size. Haven't had a beer outisde of the celebrator that was ""WORLD CLASS"" from this brewery.

OR another of the various ways individuals can alter the product.",3.74
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"A dark, but bright and somewhat translucent amber brew, drawn from a tap and delivered in a clear pint glass has arrived. The head is white, spotty and minimal. The malt dominate aroma is complex and not overly sweet. Is it vaguely nutty? Well, there seems to be a nut-like quality here to taste, likely a combination of the hops and malts. This drinks richly and incredibly smoothly malty, but not close to being overly sweet. The lack of a head and subsequent lack of lacing doesn’t indicate anything, as this is just about perfectly carbonated. The finish is wet, but clean. This will be one of the best Marzens you'll ever have.",4.44

Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Notes from 8/29/2022.
Poured from a 11oz bottle into a pint glass.
The body is amber with 2 fingers of tan head. Retention is good leaving a fluffy cap.
The intensity of aroma is low. There are notes of malt and yeast. This has one of the lowest aroma levels I've experienced.
The intensity of taste is somewhat above medium. Very malty. Wow. A lot of delicious complex malt flavor. Although subtle, the flavor has a long transition from being malt forward and then a light hop bitterness that comes in and continues to develop. I like the slight alcohol flavor at the end. World class.
The feel is almost thick. It's fairly creamy with light carbonation that prickles the tongue. Astringency is medium and balances the malt forward flavor.
Overall, the appearance, flavor and feel more than make up for the very low aroma. As far as Oktoberfest beers go, this is hands down the best I've had.",3.87
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"500 ml bottle poured into a Czech brewery pilsner glass, at fridge temp. Great foamy head that lingers just a bit.
Bought the say it went on sale, it’s very fresh!
So good, so balanced and rounded - sweet yet bitter, great flavors - this is just a beautiful European Fest beer.",4.27
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"16.9oz can purchased off the shelf as a single for $3.49. Lot code L2039. Not sure what that means but this must be fresh as it must have been bottled recently and then imported to the US.

Look: Beautiful orange/copper color, crystal clear. Small tan colored head that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. Tiny bubbles rising up the glass.

Smell: Malt forward with notes of toffee, caramel, and bread crust. Throw in some spice, floral aromas, along with earthy and soil-like notes on the finish. Interesting mix of aromas. After drinking several ounces, I make a comparison of the aromas to cream soda. Subtle note of baked apples with cinnamon.

Taste: This is really delicious. It's super drinkable and really well-balanced. Some of those lager funk notes come out on the palate, and they are welcome. Up front, this is definitely malty but it's restrained; it's malty without being sweet, which I appreciate. The carbonation is slightly spritzy, and the finish is smooth and pleasant - relatively dry considering how malt-forward the beer is and with a very gentle bitterness. The lingering perception of the beer is earthiness and a bit of spice (allspice?).

Feel: Slightly chewy mouthfeel, medium plus body. Carbonation is just right. It's not heavy or cloyingly sweet, just very balanced and drinkable.

Overall: My first Ayinger beer review. This has got to be one of the better Marzens out there. Considering that this is a mass-produced, widely distributed beer it is super impressive. They must have got their brewing process down to a science. If you could take a sourdough or Bavarian hard pretzel and make a beer inspired by those flavors, that's kind of what I imagine this beer to be.",4.19
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"A really beautiful octoberfest beer. Dark and rich in color and the nose will transport you straight to Germany. The flavor is a rich, dark marzen with a flavor punch all the through to a delicious long lasting finish. A must have for fans of this style.",4.75

Temp at Pour: mid 40s F


Look:
Dark and burnished copper that is hazy and somewhat opaque. I can see my fingers on the other side of the glass (and not very clearly) but that's about it. Makes me think of a Kellerbier. Initial 3-finger head dissipates to a thin covering with good lacing.

Smell:
Malts, malts, malts. Freshly baked whole wheat bread. Biscuits. And also bread dough. There are also notes of a darker honey such as basswood honey or wildflower honey. Yum.

Taste:
Follows the nose but with some toasted caramel notes added in. There is a malty earthiness present as well. Everything is balanced very well. The finish is a long slowly fading toasted grain note along with a slowly increasing dryness.

Feel:
Super smooth with little carbonation. Body is medium, with a nod towards the full side.

Overall:
An outstanding Marzen-style Oktoberfest. It has all of the qualities of a Marzen with the drinkability of a Festbier. This is my favorite Marzen and favorite Oktoberfest beer by far. Too bad it's only available once a year near me.",4.41
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Gem-clear amber (SRM 9-10) with an orange tint. One inch of almond cream lasts a few minutes, leaving patchy lace. Tiny, lazy bubbles of carbonation are magnified in the dimples of a Spaten mug.

The malt is sweet with no roasted or toasted notes. Light honey adds character to the scent of wheat bread dough. The aroma is mild, yet has distinct notes, similar to macadamia and almonds.

The balance is excellent, with sweetness up front and bitterness at the end. Unlike the aroma, toasted malt is strong. Wheat bread and light honey come out late. The finish is long and mild, carrying the toasted malt, and none of the other flavors, as it lingers.

The texture is velvety smooth, with a medium body. Residual sugar builds on the lips, while light alcohol and soft, tingling carbonation enliven the tongue.

This is a pleasant and easy-going Autumnal beer. I enjoyed it on a cool, sunny afternoon in the early Autumn. My only wish is that I had a salted, toasted pretzel with mustard to go with it.",3.99
Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen,"Look: Really deep amber, large foamy head that persists, looks like an ideal beer! Kinda like pee from someone really dehydrated!
Smell: Very yeasty (like i could get a yeast infection from just being around it!), hints of spices? like cinnamon and clove, kinda like pumpkin pie?? a little bit like persimmon...
Taste: Pretty bitter upfront, but mellows out into some burnt caramel notes, a bit bready, has some fruity notes like apple cider. also some fig jam flavors and some molasses
Feel: Kinda leaves your mouth a little dry, very little carbonation, like tiny bubbles that make it almost creamy in my mouth
Overall: This is a really good beer! When I take a sip of this, I feel like im in the middle of a fall festival, surrounded by big breasted ladies serving beer to Men with beer guts in a giant hall and I'm hittin on one of the hot BABES but shes like nah bro i ain't gay and im like its ok dude im not gay either i just think women are great and shes like huh? how does that even make sense are you ok? and then im like no... and start crying and she feels bad so she ends up sleeping with me anyways.

The beer is clear copper with less than a finger of off-white head. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is low. There is a crackery malt smell, an earthy smell and a slight yeast aroma.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. The flavor follows the aroma with more bitterness and dryness than the aroma suggests. The long bitter hop note is moderate, spicy and creates a layer of flavor over the crackery malt, earthy flavor and slight yeast.
The feel is slightly above medium in thickness. Carbonation and astringency are low. It's quite dry. The carbonation prickles the tongue.

Look:
Nice deep but clear copper. Initial 2-finger cream-colored foamy head dissipates very slowly leaving quite good lacing

Smell:
Quite malty without being sweet. Lighty toasted grains and bread. A lot of bread, mostly brown variety. There are notes of grass and fresh cut hay drifting around in the background

Taste:
Very much similar to the nose but with the grass and hay notes more prominent. This really does taste like liquid bread. There is some earthiness as well. Things finish dry and toasty with a slight spiciness.

Feel:
Smooth and a tad crisp Body is on the lighter side of medium.

Overall:
A very nice Märzen-style Oktoberfest. This is one of the standard-bearers of the style and rightfully so. Things do change slightly year-to-year for this brew (not by much though). Some years I prefer this brew, other years I prefer Hacker-Pschorr's. The 2 are very similar and are owned, if not brewed, by the same company. Between the 2, Paulaner always seemed to tend to being more 'grassy' or even spicy.

Sweet malt has an earthiness of orchard fruit in the background. There is also a light peppery hop aroma, however, it really is all about the malt. Fresh wheat bread comes on strong and grows with warmth.

While well balanced, it tilts slightly toward bitterness. The wheat bread is almost as strong in the flavor as it was in the aroma. Cashews and walnuts come in waves. The finish is simple, mild, and lingering.

Paulaner – Oktoberfest Marzen

5.8% ABV

The beer is listed as a “Oktoberfest Marzen” on the bottle, and “Lager – Marzen” on BA.

The beer was removed from a 45ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a HB stein.

First Impression: Looks the part. Pretty. Clear. 4.5

Appearance: This is what I would call a golden amber color. Somewhere between gold and amber. 4.35

Smell: Bier, first and foremost, as I always say. Followed by a small amount of rye spice, bread, malt, There seems to be an almost underlying lemon zest note, almost dancing on the hairs in your nostrils, if you know what I mean. 4.0

Taste: Not as flavorful as some others. A bit more one-note. A bit of bread, a bit of malt. None of the rye or lemon mentioned above. I’m struggling to identify much, as it tastes a bit watered down. 3.75

Mouthfeel: A tad thin. I almost think of most oktoberfests as being almost syrupy in their consistency, but not that thick. That may be odd. I’m struggling to describe exactly what I mean. There’s something about them that is a bit thicker on the mouth than I think they appear. 4.0

Overall: I enjoyed this. I’d have more if I had them, but at the same time I don’t think I’ll specifically seek out more of these compared to others. Very middle of the road for me. 4.00

Medium-bodied, the dryness and fluffy carbonation increase palate presence and grip. The profile very similar to the nose with even greater emphasis on a mineral, quinine nature. Speaking for myself, finding it underfruited and I am not one for bombastic IPA's. The substantial maltiness keeps the bitterness in check.

Little Whaleboat,"Pours a pale gold, a slight haze. Nose is light, citrus. Taste is the same, solid pithy grapefruit. Nota bad, just not worth the drive/cost, I'll stick to lunch.",3.47
Little Whaleboat,"16.9oz bottle purchased from the fridge for $7.49. Bottled on 6/28/22, so this is exactly five weeks old.

Look: Pours a nice light golden color with a very faint haze. There was a thick, off-white head with compact to medium bubbles that slowly reduced to a very thin layer. Nice lacing.

Smell: The aromas are intoxicating. Lots of tropical fruits including passion fruit, mango, papaya, orange, and guava. There is an interesting vanilla sweetness on the back end that I tend to get with Maine Beer Company beers. I also get this slightly acidic/juicy citrus note along with an even more subtle green bell pepper note. Allusions of dank pine resin and bitterness on the back end also.

Taste: This is sooooo drinkable! It is super juicy and flavorful, mirroring the flavors on the nose with tons of citrus and orange peel. The malt base is super light with a very subtle crackeryness and some very subtle caramel malt notes; this beer is a showcase for hops. The finish is moderately bitter with lots of grapefruit pith, and lingers long with intense mouth-drying ability.

Feel: Low side of medium body with appropriate carbonation.

Overall: Solid. A very tasty, West Coast Style IPA from Maine. Cool that this beer uses Talus hops. I think that I have only had one other beer that uses Talus hops and that was River Horse Sunset Citrus, which I really enjoyed.

From the website:
Flavor profile: Aromas of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and pine. Floral notes of rose and chamomile.
Hops: Citra, Mosaic, Columbus, Talus
Malt: American 2-Row, Maine Malt House Pilsner, Blue Ox Wheat, Blue Ox Light Munich",4.29
Little Whaleboat,Two plus fingers of airy crisp light khaki colored froth... Excellent retention... color is an exceedingly pale gold with a slight chill haze... Aroma is subtle but quite pleasant... Floral notes lead on the nose... Flavor profile is equally subtle but the malt base is displayed a bit more... Medium bodied... Slightly chewy and lush... Finish has a slightly bitter finish... Enjoyable and slightly unique beer but nothing is overly memorable... Solid execution but a bit understated...,3.93
Little Whaleboat,I think I need to pay attention to the different hops that are used in IPAs. There is definitely something in this beer that I do not like. I’m a big fan of Maine‘s Lunch beer but this just has very bitter metallic notes to it. I have it on tap so It can’t get any better. Very disappointing,3.13
Little Whaleboat,"From bottle (presume it looks like a Maine Beer, but went with my average):

Smell and taste both have a citrus pith lean. The nose leans a little more on the zest where the taste brings in more pith. There’s a candied zest nature in the nose and opening of the taste, but bitterness in the latter is firm and welcome, mostly pith with a hint of grass - both types. Tangerine, peach, orange and a little grapefruit. A great mix of the fruit notes backed by classic hop bitterness.",4.35
Little Whaleboat,"From the label: ""009 29JUN22 09:15:55""

Appearance: The body is hazy but there are no particulates or visible suspended solids. It has a light gold color that has a bit of a lemon appearance. It has a short fluffy white head with a creamy texture. It has good head retention and it has wisps of lacing on the glass.

Aroma: Immediately the nose is struck by lemon zest with a strong garlic aroma. There is a hint of lime and some pine. The aroma is strong and poignant.

Taste: Up front there is peach and lemon with a touch of lime. A freshly crushed grain flavor is also present. Towards the middle of the palate the same flavors are accentuated even more. It has hints of mint and lime zest towards the back of the palate with touches of cilantro. The beer tastes very fresh. The aftertaste is slightly floral which is interesting because there were no floral notes while drinking the beer and there were no floral aromatics. It has a bit of a floral retronasal character after drinking each sip which is very reminiscent of being in a flower section of a garden store. At times it became slightly grassy on the finish. After a while a bit of white pepper flavor also emerged.

Mouthfeel: It is light bodied trending towards medium, with good carbonation. It has a medium pithy bitterness from the hops. It feels bright on the palate.

Overall: The beer is an excellent example of the style. It brings bright aromas and flavors with excellent precision. The beer would pair very well with any dish that might need a little bit of acidity or citrus. This would be great with snapper, salmon, or even lamb. I would definitely buy it again and I highly recommend it.",4.45
Samuel Adams Jack-O,Overall an average pumpkin Ale. The spices are a little overpowering and need to be toned down. Smells like a pumpkin pie but a little too sweet for a beer.,2.92
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"12oz'er

All nutmeg with a little cinnamon. Just overpowering spice all around... Mild hops and honey malt combine with the spice to make a pumpkin pie type flavor, but it's an 11/10 on the spice and it just ends up overpowering everything else. I can tell this will be hiding in the back of the fridge for months",2.15
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Poured cold from 12-ounce bottle into a straight-sided 0.3-l mug. I was hoping that this would be a worthy replacement for Pumpkin Batch, but it was not to be. The watery mouth feel leads me to believe that this is more of an apple pie-spiced effervescent cider than a pumpkin ale. Sweet, heavy on cinnamon and clove, and a lingering finish of sour apple. I was rather disappointed in this offering from what I consider to be a usually reliable brewery. Give us another Pumpkin Batch, please.",3.29
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Tastes like artificial pumpkin combined with a fall spice candle. Overly sweet and rich in the worst way possible, fills you after one sip. Might have to pour this one.",1.5
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Not really a beer; there supposedly is an ale base to this, but I can't taste it.

Look: Amber, clear, white head that disappears quickly
Smell: Chemical nutmeg
Tase: Soda-pop sweet with chemical nutmeg.

Boston Beer Co. has in recent years made the lion's share of its profits from non beers: alcoholic seltzers, alcoholic teas, alcoholic apple juice. This is an alcoholic soda-pop. There's no beer here: no malt backbone, no hops, nothing. Just a strong chemical flavor that is cloyingly nutmeg-ish. I don't even taste the supposed connection with pumpkins.

This was included in a variety pack of their other beers; BBC needs to just develop a line of alcoholic soft drinks (nice contradiction there) and include this with those. In fact there was such a thing: this ""beer,"" I gather, was originally developed by Traveler Beer co., which specialized in ""shandies"" (one shudders to imagine how these other ""beers"" tasted). This outfit was owned by BBC. It went under, but this concoction for some reason was saved and revived by BBC. btw and fwiw: a really nice shandy, or Radler, is Von Trapp's grapefruit ""trail beer."" This will give you an idea of how it should be done.",1.62
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Imperial Pint
Look: Slightly opaque dark tan color, pouring a off white head 1 finger in height which dissipated into a thick ring with sheeting
Smell: Light pumpkin freshness entwined with cinnamon and nutmeg. Hint of fresh crisp apples with a light malt note
Taste: Neutral acidity/bitterness. Fresh Pumpkin at the front with light cinnamon and nutmeg undertones. Hint of cloves as well. Finish leaves behind light baking spices and a graham cracker malt note
Feel: med-light body with gentle carbonation and a crisp finish
Overall: Its alright, but overall low complexity. Wish there was more baking spices and a stronger malt presence",3.66
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Looks a hazy dark golden color. Nice white head that diminished to thin film that faded to just around the edge of a pint glass.

I don't really like pumpkin ales, but you could do worse",3.62
Samuel Adams Jack-O,Overall I honestly thought this was relatively good but the flavor was....idk. it wasn't bad but im leaning more towards like the pumpkin from a can and not a fresh one. This is a one and done for me but not too bad,3.19
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"With a light amber color, this has a lot of great warm spices like cinnamon and nutmeg along with subtle warm citrus that goes perfectly with the warm spices, warm toffee and biscuit and a hint of lemon! It’s wonderfully balanced with a slight sweetness and good carbonation, while the aroma and aftertaste matches warm-spiced speculaas cookies like a champ! There’s no pumpkin flavors, but it must have been eaten up by the yeasts in the brewing process. This is a very delicious spiced beer overall! I highly recommend this, along with Ballast Point Brewing’s Pumpkin Down and the Pumpkin Ale from Lakefront Brewery. If you need a stout-filled twist to your pumpkin beer, go for the Dark o’ the Moon from Elysian Brewing!",4.71
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"A pretty mediocre Pumpkin Ale!!! Poured from a12 oz bottle into a pint glass. Small fast fading white head with no lacing topped a nice clear orange color. Aroma and taste feature pumpkin spices.....sort of the beer potpourri that I don't care for. I like rich pumpkin ale with real pumpkin and malt flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit on the light style.. Far from a drain pour, but not something I would seek out again!!!",3.27
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"12oz bottle

Pours a sturdy finger of dense white head into my Boston Lager glass. Retention is wonderful, hardly losing any head after a few minutes. Initial lacing looks decent. Body is a dark copper, low visibility, with a load of nucleating bubbles coming up. Looks very nice so far.

Aroma is pretty damn assertive, and it’s a bit much. Loads of nutmeg assault the nose and it’s pretty hard to pick up anything else. Undertones of pumpkin and cinnamon. Pretty sure it’s safe to say this doesn’t smell like beer, maybe I’ve outgrown this style. It’s…alright all things considered.

Flavor is less intense, but arguably less palatable. It’s actually somewhat watery, so imagine nutmeg flavored water - yeah not that great, definitely gross at times. Like…I feel like you either make a totally bastardized pumpkin spice latte beer, or you make a real pumpkin beer that is earthy, etc. etc., but this is somehow neither. I mean, I’ve had worse, but not many in the pumpkin category, and that’s saying quite a bit.

Carbonation is on the higher side at first, fades with a little time. As mentioned, super watery, and that is true for the body as well. Bitterness is not perceptible with all the spice going on. It’s surprisingly not stupid sweet, only a touch of sweetness, which is one small redeeming factor I suppose. Overall not bad, but the watery thin mouth is pretty hard to ignore.

Appearance turned out less than expected with absolutely zero lacing.

Overall not a very good beer, it’s drinkable, but just barely.",3.18
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"12oz bottle poured into a goblet

A- pours a clear amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that reduces to a ring around the edge

S- smells of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cola

T- initial taste gives an impression of Dr Pepper, which I'm assuming is from the spice additions. Picking up cinnamon predominately. Mid-palate gives some sweet malty notes, the finish gives more cinnamon and cola

M- medium body with medium carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into the finish

O- wasn't expecting this to taste like a Dr Pepper, but it's not bad. It goes down easy, but I probably wouldn't have known it was a pumpkin beer if I tried it blind",3.54
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Copper to light amber in color with excellent clarity and vibrant carbonation bubbles. There’s a fingernail of brown around two thirds of the rim. The aroma is of nutmeg and cinnamon. I taste nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie spice. The mouth is moderately spiced and watery.",3.35
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Slightly hazy amber with a short but thick and creamy head with good retention, settling into a thin cap and ring, leaving little lacing until I tip the glass, then a thin sheet that breaks up into strings sliding back down.

The aroma is cinnamon. That's pretty much it - cinnamon. Touch of other spices, but the cinnamon dominates. I'm reminded of a guest at our home years ago from England who described American apple pie as ""cinnamon pie.""

Ah, the taste is much more nuanced. Cinnamon, of course, but also a malty presence and a smoothness that may be from the squash/pumpkin as well as nutmeg and cloves. Actually, this is a very tasty pumpkin beer, if that is your thing. (As I stated, it's not my preference, but this is quite good for what it is intended to be.) The finish is sweet and spicy, with a creamy feel left behind.

The mouth feel is thick-ish, smooth, and creamy, which is worthy of a ""well done"" considering the low ABV.

Overall, I recommend this one to fans of pumpkin ales (although, caveat emptor... since I am NOT a fan of pumpkin ales, maybe I don't know what I'm talking about.)",3.88
Samuel Adams Jack-O,"Appearance: Medium amber-orange, with a large and dense, finely-beaded head. A thick and unbroken sheet of finely-beaded lacing adorns the glass wall. Fat bubbles drift lazily to the surface.

Aroma: Classic pumpkin pie aroma is very prominent, with nutmeg and cinnamon being particularly notable. Brown sugar is a strong presence, as well. With the restrained ABV of 4.2%, there is no alcohol presence in the aroma. The aroma is overall similar to cold pumpkin pie.

Taste: The taste opens with a good measure of brown sugar and prominent pumpkin pie spices, particularly cinnamon and nutmeg. As the taste carries on, the brown sugar offers a pleasant undercurrent. Midway through the taste, there is a bit of clove. Late in the taste, there is a bit of cola flavor. The finish is rather dry.

Mouth feel: Soft and full, quite pleasant with only light carbonation.

Drinkability/notes: A quite nice example of a pumpkin beer, and at an ABV of just 4.2%, it seems very well suited to moderation. If you like a lot of pumpkin spice flavor and sweetness in a beer with a moderate ABV, this is a great choice.

Munsterfest,"There is a date that barely appears on the shoulder of the bottle. It seems like it is lightly etched in the glass. It is hard to read when there is beer in the bottle, but after it is poured out it is easier to see: ""BOTTLED 07-28-22 4663""

Appearance: The body is a medium-to-dark shade of golden brown. It has very good clarity. The head is short with a slightly off-white color. The head slowly recedes leaving no lacing and only a thin film of bubbles with a small ring around the glass. The color of the beer is very nice.

Aroma: There isn't much aroma but there is a very faint scent of wet leaves.

Taste: Up front there is a mixture of coffee, bread crust, and toffee. Towards the middle these flavors intensify and the bread crust flavor expands the greatest on the palate. Towards the back of the palate there is a very light spicy and herbal character which gives the beer just a bit of bite at the end. The aftertaste is very pleasant with a light tea quality and it lends itself very good drinkability.

Mouthfeel: The body is just at the threshold between light and medium, where it has a presence on the palate but moves on and off the tongue very quickly without much traction. The beer is very drinkability and it has a mild earthy bitterness. It is a very pleasant beer to drink.

Overall: The beer doesn't have much aroma, but that is quickly forgotten when the flavor kicks in. The beer delivers a wonderful complement of flavors and the beer is still light enough that it remains very drinkable. It is an easy beer to have one and just move on to another one. Although the highlight of the beer would be the fantastic drinkability, another element that is very enjoyable is the bread crust flavor which has just a very light touch of sweetness that is balanced by an earthy quality. I would recommend it because although the beer doesn't have much aroma it still tastes great. I would buy it again.",3.78

O: Been about 7 years since I’ve had this one, back again with the new Michigan distro. I forgot how much on the sweet and malty side this beer is, was expecting more of a hoppy crispness. But I do like this, pretty good balance and very drinkable as a good Oktoberfest should be.

Recommendation: Maybe not a classic rendering by most standards, but this is a nice-drinking Oktoberfest for the season.",4.35

Munsterfest,"Before I start, let me say this beer makes me happy. First of all, all these American o-fests have done what Americanized versions always do, and that is take the basic profiles of a style and turn all the flavors up wayyyy too high and nothing is as drinkable or balanced anymore. On that note...

Munsterfest is everything I want in an ofest. A poundable lager with malty and warm flavors, a whispy head, and beautiful color. You have to pour this vigorously to get the foamy head and lacing.. it might be ever-so-slightly under-carb’d, but that actually lends to the drinkability AND the flavors of this ofest. It has a little red ale in the nose, slightly metallic but not too off-putting, so at first, before the sip, I wasn’t sure. TheN this glorious ofest elixir hit my tongue, and wowza!!!!!

This beer tastes great. Cold, warm, no matter, but i think its better colder than some other versions of this style. Thats not necessarily a bad thing tho.. it slight lack of carbonation and the silkiness that makes it unique. Its very smooth and creamy in the taste despite the low carb and thinner body.. its a thin oil slick of ofest greatness. You have the big flavor spins like Sams or Great Lakes, and I love them both in their own way, but if i wanna pound a great ofest in massive seasion manner, give me Munsterfest. Im putting behind a classic like Ayinger, but for an American ofest, its originality, poundability, and viscosity, make it a bright shining star!!! This beer is fan-freaking-tastic, and more than any ofest in years, has me going back for more and more.. that night.. each week.. until they are available no more..",4.25

The aroma is excellent, massive barrel character, huge spirit heat, charred oak, roasted grain, bittersweet dark chocolate, toasted coconut, stone fruits, heavy vanilla marshmallow and a sea salt kick. The flavors are good, super rich chocolate, dark, bittersweet, big roast, charred oak, coconut, toffee, brown sugar, stone fruits, vanilla marshmallow and light sea salt. The mouthfeel is great, super thick and coating, massive body, creamy texture with a warm finish.

Pumpkin Spice Latte Nitro,"13.65oz nitro-can poured into a tulip.

Pours a hazy glowing burnt golden; creamy light khaki head that fades leaving bubbly retention and little to no lacing; great nitro-beer magic with a hard pour.

The aromas have a nice amount of pumpkin spices leading the way. Some caramel. Mild hints of coffee and vanilla. Some veggies. Malts are there.

The flavors follow the nose. More pumpkin spices leading the way, especially cinnamon and nutmeg. More caramel and vanilla. The coffee is on the subtle side, but it's ultimately noticeable. More veggies along with some sweet potatoes. Mild spice notes that linger in the finish. Moderate sweetness. Lower bitterness. Strong malt backbone. Alcohol goes unnoticed.

Mouthfeel is what you'd expect from a nitro-beer. It's on the fuller side of medium-bodied and actually pushing full-bodied with no carbonation. It's watery as expected, but it's actually a bit thicker than expected.

Pumpkin Spice Latte Nitro,"16 oz can.

Pours a hazy orange gold color. Typical white nitro head. Not great retention or lacing for the style.

Smells like ginger and squash.

The ginger dominates the flavor, with some nutmeg, pumpkin, and caramel. Has a bit of roasted coffee on the finish. Cinnamon and allspice cling to the tongue, eventually overstaying their welcome.

The feel is typical of the style. A tad watery. The spices linger a bit too long.

Overall, 3's across the board, i.e. Meh. Not the worst pumpkin beer I've had but far from the best, and this is a style I'm already not terribly fond of.

If you really, really love pumpkin ales then it's certainly worth a shot. If not, don't bother. Just get the stout.",3.0
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Nice classic German beer. Simple ingredients. Slight bready aroma. Bready malt taste to start, with crisp, clean finish. Medium carbonation. A very drinkable beer.",3.77
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Poured from a growler purchased at Collective.

Appearance - Pours a clear gold with three fingers of bubbly frothy white head.

Smell - earthy, floral, leafy, and grassy hops, bready and biscuity malts, lemon, and earthy yeast.

Taste - bitter earthy, floral, and grassy hops upfront. The bready and biscuity malts alongside the lemon come through next. The earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky from the hops with the bready notes lingering as well.

Overall - A very quaffable festbier. I can see why this is drunk in high volumes in Germany on Oktoberfest. This one is quite flavourful as well. Glad I could try one of the official brews of Oktoberfest.",4.28

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"This brew two years ago was OUTSTANDING. But I noticed last year it changed. Like many others it was cheapened, hence the drop in quality and taste. It is still pretty good, (sorry cannot be more illustrative) not bad for the style, but unfortunately it went from arguably the best of the Marzen creed to very average. It use to have a wonderful aftertaste that dangerously incited you to drink large amounts of it, but now, after one or two you're like; meh. And then the despair as you remember what it was like in the recent past. This opinion is not just mine, but shared by a few I know, friends that know this style of beer, to bar managers that order it. They too share my dismay. Sad. For the price of this beer there are others that are better and cost less.",3.36
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,This is definitely rated lower than I would have thought. On my own personal experience I found this really good and definitely an accurate representation of the style. Maybe not greatest in the world but idk I was satisfied.,3.93
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"A clear, golden yellow beer in the glass with a thin, straggly head.

Aroma-wise there's bread and some floral notes that foretell of the balance and drinkability to come.

In the mouth there's a beautiful balance of mild bitterness, subtle floral hops, an ever-so-slight corn note and retronasally soft creaminess that demands another sip.

There's a reason this is drunk all day long in one-litre vessels. The alcohol is hidden, the beer is refreshing and the whole experience synergises into something greater than all of the parts.

Perhaps it's the romance of the style or the aura of the festival that lends this beer its name, but whatever it is, I want another one!

Cheers!",4.38
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"My first shot at an Oktoberfest bier! Pours a rich golden straw colour, a one inch head quickly appears and disappears within a minute. Regardless, it looks very nice in the tall glass. Unlike many pils I’ve had in this glass, the bubbles are enormous, streaking upwards in multiple lines. Would’ve looked absolutely gorgeous with a thick rocky head.

Straightforward aromas of wheat, bready malt, and some sparing citrusy but mostly grassy hops.

Right away this beer hits you with very typical taste profiles, and yet, there is a deliciously subtle and relatively complex smattering of tastes in the background. Up front is grain and toasty bread, a little bit of juicy corn. The malty notes balanced by an oh so gentle bitterness from the hops. What are those notes in the background? Fairly hard to differentiate, but they add up to a mildly savoury character. It’s a little bit nutty, a little bit floral, and a little bit earthy. They coalesce to make a savoury, earthy backing to the grassy grains that are more up front. A little bit of esters on that fruity note.

Tastes quite nice with a mild finish on the palate that is basically just bready malt, there is strong carbonation here that foams at the sip, it doesn’t become too creamy or heavy, but just eminently drinkable. The higher abv% is not noticed whatsoever. I doubt anyone would be able to tell if this was a 4% pils, a 5.5% lager, or the 6.3% brew it is. Medium-light bodied that finishes dry and sweet, this is a tasty drink.

Overall — a really good festbier. If this is a good example of the style, I can’t wait to try more. I’ll admit this was a long wanted find for me. I’ve been hunting the entire Hofbrau line in Canada for a long time. Hofbrau Oktoberfest was only at 4 stores at the LCBO, most having one or two left. I went to all 4.

Nothing. The leftover was just artifacts in the LCBO online system (someone probably shoplifted them). So to my surprise, I found it randomly at a North York LCBO that didn’t even have it listed. I bought all four that were left. Glad I did, you could easily drink all four in a single sitting. The design really draws you in, a nice brown bottle with classy and understated labelling. The Oktoberfest has inviting autumnal tones of orange and a nice scene on the front.

This beer has a little something going for it that is hard to put a finger on. It is definitely unique and does not taste like a typical lager or Pilsner despite having the same hallmark flavours. I really enjoyed this, the flavours are just so well balanced and in tune, it would be easy to mistake this for a general, slightly above average beer. But there’s much more going on!

JUNE 13th DRINK:
Had the last of my Oktoberfest biers, likely the last we’ll see until, well next October! I stand by the review and despite the beer being a few months older now, it’s just as fresh and drinkable. Smell increasing from original 3.25 to 3.5, it smells just fine! Feel increased from 3.75 to 4. It’s crisp and delicious.",3.82
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"I’m going to be as objective as I can but it’s going to be difficult. Rewind back to the halcyon days of 2009, I was traveling to Germany to visit some folks of a friend of mine. I was 20 years old and a year before I joined BA.

Eventually we wind up at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. Sitting at the giant tables, eating white sausage and getting housed off of 2 liters of beer was one of the most phenomenal drinking experiences I’ve ever had. I will always have an affinity for the brand, but I will try to keep it legit.

My attempt to keep it legit is evident in the appearance. It sucks. It pours a weak straw color with some good head.

Aroma is of oh so smooth caramel malts and breast undertones

Tastes of biscuits, caramel, some dark fruit in the finish with some metallic tones bringing it down a bit.

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"This is my current favourite beer. My near perfect rating may be out of step with the others here, but I don't care. For me, this is beer done right. The colour is lighter than you might expect for a Märzen, though I guess we're now making a distinction between Festbier and Märzen, in which case it's about average compared to most of the other Munich Six: clear deep gold, with a frothy white head that has surprisingly long retention considering the high ABV. The smell and taste, however, are ""darker"" than the colour would suggest. On the nose, the first impression is a very deep, nutty, bready malt, with a hint of caramel, and something spicy. The taste starts the same way, with a beautiful and richly complex malt profile, very distinctively nutty, with the impression of dark, chewy bread, subtle and subdued caramel malt, followed up by a lovely earthy hops that is deep and rich, rather than bright and zesty or bitter, and a gentle spicy pepper hops finish. I can't stress enough how well it all works together. The ingredients must have been so carefully considered to construct such a perfectly balanced flavour profile, which nevertheless has a very distinctive character. The malts are smooth and deep without being too rich or sweet, and the hops profile affirms and strengthens this ""middle of the tongue"" balance. It's perfection. The mouthfeel is very smooth, slightly creamy, exactly middle weight, not too heavy for a hot day nor too light for a winter night - this beer is Balance in a Bottle, without being boring. The alcohol content is seamlessly disguised, and I mean seamlessly, to the point of being dangerous. You would not guess it's 6.3% as you were drinking it, and if you didn't know that going in, by the time you realised how strong it was it would be too late. Almost a shame, because I would love to be able to drink more than one of these with supper and still be able to have a sober evening, but alas. Overall, this for me is the perfect beer for any and every time, because it is so perfectly ""in the middle"" of so many ratios: sweetness to dryness, malts to hops, complexity to drinkability. Hofbräu has achieved the Golden Ratio with their Oktoberfestbier, and I say Prost to that.",4.99
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"On tap at Das Beer Garden. Clear deep golden. Smells a little bready with hints of floral hops. Tastes of sweet bread with light toasted notes.

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Today is a new beer to me.

Hofbrau – Oktoberfestbier

6.3% ABV

The beer is listed as an Oktoberfest festbier on the label – and listed as “Lager – Festbier / weisnbier” on BA. I have no earthly idea what a weisnbier is.

The beer was removed from a 40ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a classic Hofbrau dimpled stein. Consumed over a 40ish minute period while eating a brat with german mustard and barrel kraut.

First Impression: Quite beautiful; pours a wonderful hay/straw golden yellow with a nice head. 4.35

Appearance: Beer is quite clear, but perhaps not as clear as one might hope or expect. Maybe that expectation is unrealistic, but my feelings for a festbier are similar to (approaching) those for a pilsner with it being quite clear. Beautiful color, although perhaps a shade darker than expected. 4.6

Smell: As is always the case for me with Oktoberfest beers, this one isn’t particularly fragrant. I get a very light bready nose, and then something I can’t quite identify. It’s a little sweet. Again (see taste below), I get some Belgian esters that no one else seems to get. 4.0

Taste: Much to my surprise, this is actually quite nice for a festbier. I’m normally not one for festbiers, as I traditionally find them quite pale – and more pale than I prefer. There’s almost no discernable hop presence. I’d argue this is almost like a cross between a marzen and a festbier, but I’m no expert. I still get some of the Belgian esters that others don’t get (specifically some bubblegum and clove). Only a small amount of yeasty, bread, crust flavor – not as much as I’d prefer. 4.35

Mouthfeel: Nothing special. Mostly classic, but thicker than I’d prefer, especially for a festbier. I’d prefer if this were a bit more crisp, which I normally associate with festbiers. 3.85

Overall: Not a lot to add. This is good, but perhaps not everything I would look for in a festbier. Truth be told, I purchased this by accident, since I usually enjoy marzens more than festbiers due to the hop presence. By that metric, I should like this, but it’s just not hitting the spot (both for me personally and for what I think this beer should be). It is going quite well with the brat and kraut, however. 4.0

BA Review Score: 4.161",4.11
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Clear golden pour with two fingers of white foam, no lacing oddly enough. German yeast dominated nose with malt sweetness in an airy way. Taste is more complex with a bready and mild caramel malt flavor complexion with a kiss of honey, but yeast character suffers. Feel is light, airy, yeasty, but doesn't have any lasting power on the palate.",3.62
Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Bottled 4/5/21

Just as I was complaining that Half Time sent way more Märzens than Festbiers in the mixed pack, I open the fridge and find a Festbier! This one doesn’t really have great ratings, but at least it’ll be a nice change of pace from the overly sweet Märzen I just had from Blue Point. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a clear bright gold with 2 fingers of creamy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

Well, despite the change up in style, this is still overly sweet in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of bready malt, earthy hops, toasted grain, sweet caramel, white pepper, and honey

It’s at least saved in taste, where there’s more of a firm bitterness. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting pale malt, spicy hops, toasted bread, white pepper, and a touch of caramel. The swallow sweetens up a bit, bringing notes of overripe pear, caramel malt, earthy hops, and toasted grain

A medium body pairs with moderate scrubbing carbonation, resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer. Finishes off dry but a bit too sweet

I think this one is pretry good. Quite up there in alcohol for the style but it doesn’t feel like it. I could throw back quite a few of these",3.82

Hofbräu Oktoberfestbier,"Sampling a cold 11.2 oz bottle poured into my .5L dimple mug. The beer pours a clear golden color, a deep champagne color in the glass. Bleached white fluffy head of 2 cm foams up and fades to a sturdy edge layering. Several streams of active carbonation rise to the surface of my glass.
The aroma is some biscuit malts and light fruit with a bit of white grape and also some mild spicy hops. Generally a mild and clean nose.
First sip reveals a light body with fine and prickly carbonation. Texture is a little watery and totally crushing fast for drinking. Dries out just a bit on the finish.
Flavor is some biscuit and a bit of grain. Not as fruity as the nose. Finish is dry and does have some spicy hop bite that lingers a bit with mild astringency, and then is gone.
Overall this is a very easy to drink beer and has a favorable flavor profile. Glad to have tried this one.",3.9

Nose and taste are all about the barrel. Blending wonderfully with the bourbon is a delightful coffee flavor from the addition of Dark Matter coffee. My memory believes this stout is CBS without the chocolate notes.

Mouthfeel is good but not as heavy as one might expect given the ABV.",4.56
Crushing Mass,This is definitely a great stout and I'm glad I like it considering I've been less than impressed with some of their other beers in other styles.

Was worth getting a 4 pack,4.24
Crushing Mass,"Got this from @Jzeilinger and Thank You for it.
The bottle pour is into a clear glass goblet and a thick and mostly black color liquid emerges. A dark tan colored head forms and then very quickly disappears leaving no trace of having been there.

The aroma is mostly coffee that has been fresh roasted along with a touch of bourbon. I thought I also caught some vanilla and oak.

The beer tasted like roasted dark coffee with hints of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon, but mostly coffee.

Overall, I find it to be really good, and a strong coffee-dominated Stout. The high ABV is also a nice touch. Would I recommend this Stout? You betcha!!",4.29
Crushing Mass,"Drank from a 12fl oz (355ml) bottle purchased at Craft Beer Cellar, Belmont, MA
Bottled 10-25-21
Served in a tulip

Fantastic label design. 3 Floyds always impresses in this department. As for the beer, it poured a deep brown/black hue and thinner than anticipated. A small cap of saddle brown bubbles topped the body, but it quickly dissolved. There was zero head retention and no lacing whatsoever. An oily sheen floated on top of the liquid.

The aroma was solid initially and improved with time. Rich and malty. Nice melding of roasted and caramel malt notes. Darker roast coffee also came through strong. Good dose of brown sugar sweetness too. There was a punchy booziness, but not much bourbon specifically. As the beer warmed, the nose became sweeter, punchier and more rounded. Some dark chocolate and vanilla notes also came forth.

The flavor profile was solid but not amazing. Malty and robust up front. Loads of roasted malt character. Hint of char. Roasty coffee notes were apparent but definitely not as strong as in the nose. Big boozy notes kicked in soon and intensified as the beer moved along the palate. Brown sugar was also noticeable. Touch of chocolate. More roast, char and booze on the back end and in the finish.

The mouthfeel was rather disappointing. It was somewhat oily and slick but quite thin for the style. The liquid contained a fine, subtle effervescence that seemed appropriate for a beer of this magnitude.

Crushing Mass was an enjoyable coffee stout, but the bourbon barrel presence was unfortunately quite subtle and the mouthfeel much thinner than anticipated. Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this beer was that the alcohol was so well buried.",3.98
Crushing Mass,"Brief Review:

O: Ever since GI stopped doing BCBCS, I've been starving for a good BA coffee stout. Prairie's Mocha Noir blew me away last year, and here comes a new one from Three Floyds. This one's pretty decent. It's a little harsh up front, pretty boozy at 15.1%. Coffee is pretty acidic and very forward. It's nice and balanced on the finish though, ends more more drinkable than you think. Mouthfeel medium+, could be better. Overall could use a little more balance, maybe even a touch of sweetness from something.

Recommendation: Great coffee BA stout from Three Floyd's here, great to see them churning out some awesome one-offs again that are more affordable and available.",4.55

The flavor also features bourbon combined with a modest sweetness and an astringent roasty quality on the finish. The mouthfeel is modestly sticky.

Not unexpected for a BBA brew that sat for a year in Willet bourbon barrels. Wow, the nose is a coffee stout on steroids with fresh ground coffee, burnt coffee grinds, a bag full of coffee and espresso beans, charred wood, smoked grains, molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla, oaky notes and bourbon. It’s got that Starbucks mocha Frappuccino smell but like it’s was poured over some of the best coffee beans you’ve ever inhaled. I could get into this first thing every morning.

The taste is really good, but a drop off from the aroma. The alcohol heat and thinness of the stout body take away from it a little bit, but the flavor is also really tasty. It’s chock full of fresh ground coffee, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, coffee beans, espresso, charred wood, smoked grains, molasses, dark chocolate, soy sauce, cocoa powder, bakers chocolate, hot fudge, cacao nibs, bourbon and/or dark rum, more bitter dark chocolate and faint piney hops as it finishes.

The aroma is really interesting. Fairly unique, I can't quite put my finger on it.

I don't know like it's not quite all the way into licorice, it's a little more sharp and fresh than that... more bay laurel than anise. But it kind of enwreaths the whole thing and is... interesting and compelling.

The flavour takes similar cues, but explores them slightly differently. There's sweet toffee, there's toasty raisin bread, there's some of that classic leather and like.. tobacco marriage of that same profile into the more earthy/plant-based realm. The licorice/menthol/whatever kind of note doesn't really emerge on the tongue, I think the role is taken more by the tobacco side of things.
The finish has strong evidence of hopping, in a piney vein. Creamy and sweet blend with this earthy bitterness to linger, aided by sharp carbonation.

It's certainly interesting and I do rather enjoy it. I think the hops move in a bit much at the end, similar to an american style barleywine, but that's a minor nit to pick.",3.97
Tynt Meadow,"With the traditions of Trappist ale broadening into the British landscape, it only makes sense that the brotherhood of that region takes on the taste of that region as well. Brewed in the strong English Ale character, Tynt Meadow gives the Trappist beer portfolio a unique and classic taste.

Mout Saint Bernard's Abbey rolls out Tynt Meadow, a deep mahogany ale that's cast in a dim and foggy haze before sitting underneath a rich sepia-stained lather. Malty aromas of toffee, cola and slight chocolate precedes an earthen perfume of dark, dried and pitted fruit, a hint of tobacco and leather with a twinge of vinous spice on the nose. Sweeter and richer tasting, the early palate is introduced to those condensed grain flavors of sorghum, chocolate and toffee.

As richly textured as it is flavored, the beer's sweetness saturates the middle palate to lay a foundation of malt where the flavors of date, fig, apricot, apple and plumb rest upon. Condensed, dried and macerated in its taste, the fruits lead into a soilish taste of tobacco, rye and a general mossy earthiness. Trending balanced in its bitterness, a broad and woodsy finish is accompanied with hints of sherry, fennel and sarsaparilla.

Full bodied, yet still relaxed in its sense of drinkability, the matured ale meets all the hallmarks of classic British Stock Ale and Olde Ale but with a slight nod to aspects of more Belgian-like Dubbel Ale. Finishing on the maltier side of malty-dry, the beer closes with a broad aftertaste of fruit and spice.",4.0
Tynt Meadow,"I'm glad this finally landed stateside. Poured from 11.2-ounce bottle into a Chimay chalice. Light caramel sauce colored pour, with a thin light tan head that disappeared in short order. I didn't decant this, so there was quite a bit of sediment in the glass. Soldiering on, though. I'm not getting the chocolate notes that the brewer mentions, perhaps because it was poured cold. I am getting notes of roasted malt, a little dark bread, dried fruit, peppery spice, yeast funk, and a hint of tart apple. A slightly sour note carries over to the finish and lingers on the back of the tongue. There are unmistakable umami notes, which I love and which I often detect in some wild ales and bottle-conditioned beers. Overall, a very good beer that's worth seeking out.",3.91
Tynt Meadow,"L: Hazy light brown, hardly any head.
S: Nutty, sweet, and alcoholic. Caramel, whisky, faint hops, roasty malt.
T: Quite roasty. Upfront molasses and a nice hoppy backbone, then big leather notes, fig, nuts, and a finish that blends toasted malt and whisky flavors. There’s a pronounced hoppiness that lingers after each sip.
F: Wet, and alcohol is fairly masked.
O: I was very excited to try this and I wasn’t disappointed. It’s almost like a lighter version of an English barleywine, without a loss of complexity.
To me, this is what beer is.",4.53

Tynt Meadow,"Poured into a Fremont small snifter. Pours a medium to dark mahogany brown with light haze and a fine, one finger khaki head with great retention and solid lacing. Aroma of biscuit malt, raisins, figs, dry caramel and a hint of cocoa. Flavor is dry biscuit and caramel malt, raisins, dates, light grassy hops, hints of nuts and cocoa; a little rye-like tartness in the finish. Medium bodied with light to moderate creaminess. It's been a while since I've had this style, but remember it with fondness. This has and excellent malty body reminiscent of an old ale, but with more dried fruit character. Interesting light chocolate and nut notes. Hopped lightly, with a mild hop bitterness with little herbal qualities. A slight tartness in the finish as I recall from most of this uncommon style of English ale. Very enjoyable. Great to have an example of well made, British Trappist brewing.",4.19
Tynt Meadow,"Thanks to Merchant du Vin for bringing this in to the U.S. Best before January 25th, 2024 - enjoyed on July 16th, 2022. Poured from a 330mL bottle into my small nonic. Served around 50F per the brewery's recommendation.

Dark chestnut/burgundy body with an active rocky wheat cap. Vague lacing; poor retention.

Raisins, plums, leather, ester-laden yeast notes. Rich caramelized malt.

Deep, rich malt notes - melanoidin forward with brown bread, coffee cake, and toast. Jammy, faintly nutty, with not quite moderate bitterness throughout. Medium finish with a hint of char/smoke around the edges. Potent and complex.

Medium-light bodied, a bit fizzy, with restrained alcohol.

A unique Belgian-influenced traditional English strong ale. Hints of Dubbel, Winter Warmer, etc.",4.07
Tynt Meadow,"A: Pours slightly murky dark mahogany in color with light to moderate amounts of fine active visible carbonation rising along the edges of the glass and moderate ruby red + garnet red + chestnut brown + cola brown + amber colored highlights. The beer has a two finger tall dense creamy foamy tan head that slowly reduces to a large patch of medium thick film covering approximately 95% of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Moderate aromas of dark + toasted + smoked malts with a light to moderate amount of dark fruit (raisin + plum + date) as well as brown sugar sweetness. Light to moderate aromas of tobacco + chocolate + coffee as well as some hints of oakiness/woodiness.. Light aromas of spicy yeast. Hints of earthy + herbal hops.

T: Upfront there are slightly stronger than moderate flavors of dark + toasted + smoked malts with a light to moderate amount of dark fruit (raisin + plum + date) as well as brown sugar sweetness. That is followed by just shy of moderate flavors of dark unsweetened chocolate + coffee + tobacco as well as some hints of oakiness/woodiness. Then there are moderate flavors of spicy yeast. Finally there are slightly heavier than light flavors of earthy + herbal hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which slowly fades away leaving a light hint of the smoked malts behind.

M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth and dry.

O: Drinks pretty easily considering the complex malt flavor profile and the higher ABV though the alcohol is well hidden and there is a smooth dry mouthfeel. Really loving the combination of flavors and aromas from the English and Belgian traditions and the smoked malts is a very nice touch.",4.21

Tynt Meadow,"A: Pours up a deep, cloudy mahogany with quickly receding, soapy, caramel one-finger head, nice lacing.
S: Immediate notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, some dark fruit and a a savory quality.
T: Rich and warming right away, the butterscotch, malt, and toffee notes take the lead here, there is a mild bitterness in the finish that keeps the beer from being too decadent, offering balance, there is also a subtle tartness in the finish, which I don’t find to be really suggestive of anything specifically, I also get something that very subtly suggests peat or tobacco, hard to say which.
M: On the fuller side of a medium body, a nice and balanced carbonation.
O: I really like this a lot. I think this is a splendid first offering from the monks of the Mount Saint Bernard Abbey and I’m excited to see what (if anything) they release next. It’s rich but not quite decadent (thankfully) and has a very accessible complexity to it, if I had any gripe, it would be that I would have liked to have gotten some of the dark fruit from the nose in the taste and perhaps a bit more of those savory notes as well.",4.21

Tynt Meadow,"did not realize there was an english trappist beer until i stumbled upon this one in my travels, cool that it exists, but i didnt love the liquid, i guess i expected something more belgian, since that is mostly what we get from these operations, no matter where they are, but this drinks all malty and uninteresting on the fermentation side, almost like a heavy scotch ale or something, not a bad beer, just different. its deep reddish brown cola color in the glass, molasses toned, with a frothy khaki head that slowly settles, looks a bit dense from the bottle but lively enough too. the nose is weirdly sweet and spicy, i get some earthy character, some umami too, and almost soy thing there, but also a concentrated long boiled grain base, even some chateau type specialty malt in it, sugary and heavy, but distinctive and pretty good. i get all of that in the flavor too, maybe a little peppery element thrown in and some stewed fruit, rum raisin, and old decaying wood. its the ferment thats not quite there for me, even in the absence of belgian esters or something, i wanted more than what seems to be pretty pedestrian english ale yeast, bready and present, but samey and incomplete in its work, more residual sugar here than i can handle too much of. it drinks oddly stronger than it is too, like this isnt a crazy abv, but the beer feels boozy and massive for some reason, maybe all the body, and as much as i appreciate this for being a little different in this trappist space, i also dont think its technically wonderful, which is something i have come to expect from this designation. more carbonation would help it, but drying out is the biggest thing. an attempt at balance is made though, some bitterness is there in the finish once it warms a little, a sort of heather and tea herbal thing, maybe from hops, maybe from actual herbs, gentian root or something, its subtle but it helps and adds a little intrigue. i enjoyed tasting it, but was glad to be sharing the bottle. somewhat of a novelty for me. do these guys make any other flavors or just this one?",3.64
Tynt Meadow,"Pours a very deep, dark mahogany colour that is fairly cloudy. Two and a half fingers of dense foam slowly compile into a finger thick head that lasts a decent while.

A strong, dark English ale that is also Trappist, I’m looking forward to this unique blend! Which you can smell on the nose which gives me a decent whiff of chocolate, dark fruit like cherries, figs. Caramel malts add more sweetness, with a wooden and slightly floral character in the background.

Taste is, wow, I’ve never had a beer like this before! I’m going to do my best to break this down into different flavour profiles of the beer. Starting with fruit — prunes, dark cherries, and figs. Some dried and sugared qualities here. Delicious. Spices — licorice absolutely is present, aniseed, caramelized sugar. Cinnamon, maybe? Could just be the sugar. Malty flavours present, caramelized and roasted malts. Dark chocolate here compared to the lighter chocolate of the nose. Likely due to the mix of flavours, the wooden notes I get come with a whiff of smokiness. Not quite like a Rauchbier, but a smoky flavour is absolutely present. Even moderately savoury in character. Earthy here, molasses, and a slightly yeasty, slightly breadiness is left on the palate when all is said and done.

Medium bodied with average carbonation that lightly prickles the tongue, fairly smooth going down. Bittersweet finish leaving the ghost of the spices and chocolates, a roasted, wooden bitter character balancing the sweet malts and bready yeastiness left over.

Beer is very powerful in aroma and taste. Complex, but more than that, it’s unique. You’ve never had a Trappist, or even just regular beer in general, like this before. Blending spiced beers, English ales, and strong Belgian ales and dubbels, it’s a product that is uniquely its own and inimitable. Check the website for the cool way they source and make their beer. Love this, and glad I bought the last one as an extra for the cellar a week ago!",4.31
Tynt Meadow,"330 mL bottle from the LCBO; best before Mar 3 2023 and served slightly chilled.

Pours a deep copper-chestnut brown hue with reddish highlights, producing one finger of soapy, foamy, khaki-coloured head that dissipates within two minutes or so. A bubbly collar of suds remains in place, but with little in the way of lace initially - though that collar really clings to the glass, depositing lace as the level drops with each sip. Woodsy and herbal on the nose, with discernible booze and a malt-forward profile - fig, prune and grape, with caramelized malts, treacle and toasted bread, as well as hints of spice and licorice.

This is a bold-tasting beer: utterly unique in my experience, combining some of my favourite aspects of strong English and Belgian ales. I'm getting dark fruit flavours such as black fig, date and prune at the forefront, with sweeter flavours of treacle, toffee and toasted, bready malts developing soon after. Mild suggestions of dark chocolate towards the finish, with woodsy, herbal hops and peppery spice yeastiness tying up the back end; hints of licorice, burnt sugar and earthy bitterness persist into the aftertaste, which is a little warming. Medium-full in body, with relatively soft carbonation that meekly agitates the surface of the palate; feels smooth and satisfying to sip. I could drink another glass of this, but to be honest 330 mL seems about right.

Final Grade: 4.44, an outstanding A grade. Tynt Meadow is one of the finest strong English ales I've encountered to date, and I'd highly encourage beer geeks everywhere to seek this beer out and try it as soon as possible. There are definitely some Belgian dark ale influences going on here, so it's more of a hybrid than a pure English strong - but I feel that these two styles are fairly complementary, working very well with each other, indeed. Fantastic stuff, should've grabbed more, etc. - more importantly, I couldn't have asked for a better way to celebrate my 2750th review. Cheers BA!",4.44
Tynt Meadow,Bottle: Poured a dark burgundy color ale with a large brown foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of dry figs and raisins with some candi sugar notes and caramelized malt notes. Taste is also a mix of dry raisins and figs notes with some caramelized malt notes and light toffee notes. Body is full for style with good carbonation and lights arming alcohol notes. Well brewed with a nice complexity level.,4.25
Tynt Meadow,"Pours a crystal clear dark ruddy brown color. Two to three fingers velvety off-white head forms on the beer. It starts to dissipate, but ultimately settles in with a nice layer of foam on top of the beer.

Aroma is slightly oxidized - there are lovely notes of raisins, dark fruit, dark bread, brown sugar and fig.

Taste follows the nose with notes of dark fruits, dark bread, brown sugar, figs, molasses with some estery yeast notes. It has definitely got some oxidized notes, but they actually work well within the overall profile.

Feel is thinner bodied, but somehow hefty with a noticeable alcohol heat to it even all these years later. Prickly but mild carbonation.

Overall it is a really unique and quite enjoyable Trappist ale.",4.12
Tynt Meadow,"Pours and smells like a trappist. But is it one?

Tynt Meadow,"330 m bottle served cold into a tulip. LCBO purchase for around $4-5 CDN. Best before 02/02/2023.

Appearance - Dark honey brown that appears a dark brown in glass. A finger of light tan head with yellowy brown highlights rests on top. Average staying powering and no lacing to speak of.

Smell - Boozy, treacle and molasses with a healthy dose of ripe fermented dark fruits (plums, raisins and figs). Some apples maybe in there too. Smells like a serious heavy hitter of a beer. Trace amounts of woodiness. More malty and adding caramel as it warms.

Taste - Wood and earthiness, some mustiness, grape must and apple skins. There's an element of treacle and molasses in the background but comes in much later. Some suggestions of smoke. Leather is very prominent. Complex and quite strikingly different that the nose. Complicated.

Mouthfeel - Full bodied in the way it behaves in your mouth, but not a lot of carbonation also gives a lighter feeling. Bone dry. Booze is present but feels the way it should for a 7.4% brew (maybe feels a bit higher).

Overall - Complex and hard to nail down, tasty but your nose and mouth may not always be in agreement on what the flavors and aromas are. Quite delicious and ever evolving, in that sense reminds me of some of the finer Belgian brews (dubbels, tripels, quads and high ABV saisons) in that they are ever evolving and the flavors will change significantly even from the beginning to the end of the beer as it warms. Excellent brew.",4.2

Lawson's really missed an opportunity to name this Liquid Hopcelot for the small demographic that would find the name amusing.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a just slightly hazy golden body beneath a full head of white foam. The aroma clearly shows that there are some ""dank"" hops in play, but it's also earthy, herbal, floral, and piney. Interesting. It smells kind of like a damp forest. On to the taste... I didn't get the malt in the aroma but it's certainly here. It's sweetish and grainy, and I'm guessing that it's probably Pilsner malt. There's a grassiness to it that suggests Pilsner malt but it's pretty strong so it's got to be coming from hops too. That could be throwing me off on the malt although that richer graininess is still there. The hops remain earthy, herbal, floral and piney but there's also some fruitiness to it. I'm thinking gooseberry, white grape, passionfruit, nectarine, sweet berries, apple, pear, a bit of citrus, some apricot, and a touch of plum. My guesses for hop varieties would be Nelson Sauvin, Mosaic, and Simcoe although this beer uses 8 different hops so there have to be more. Ahh, you know what else might be in here? Summit hops. I get a little bit of that herbal, garlic, and onion thing they have going on in the nose. In any case I think you get the idea. A median bitterness balances it, working well against the sweetish and grainy malt, and it finishes mainly dry and bitter with herbs, woodiness, and a little bit of fruit lingering. In the mouth it's medium bodied and gently crisp and then smooth. I'm quite impressed with this beer. It's unusual and unique.

Tucher Festbier,"Picked up a four-pint pack. Canning date of 08/01/2022 -- very fresh!

Pours a crystal clear copper in color with hints of gold and a frothy finger-thick head atop that fades fairly quickly. A bit of lacing on the glass, some slides some clings. Carbonation looks average. Exactly as expected in appearance -- slightly darker than a helles hinting at a bit more flavor complexity and a bit less drinkability.

Aroma is bready malts, perhaps some rye, roasted corn, yeast, tea and lots of grassy, lemony hops. Seems to be pretty balanced on the nose, perhaps slightly hop forward. A bit earthy with a hint of alcohol and spice.

Taste follows the aroma well, if a bit more malty than expected. Roasted, rye malts up front with a spicy, hoppiness coming in towards the middle and into the swallow. Finishes with a spicy, lemon hoppiness and roasted maltiness on the tongue. A bit earthy overall and a tad sweet, but balanced out nicely by the roastiness of the malts and a hint of bitterness from the hops.

Medium bodied, this one drinks smooth with a hint of chewiness and light, zesty carbonation. Quite drinkable, but has a viscousness that tells me I probably shouldn't drink more than a few pints of this.

Another great brew from Tucher. This reminds me a lot of their helles. It's basically a stronger, more flavorful version of the same thing, which is exactly what I'd expect from their festbier. It's probably a bit sweet for my tastes overall, but I very much appreciate the quality of this. It's an excellent treat for autumn, it definitely feels like a brew of occasion. I continued to be impressed by Tucher. Prost!",4.04

Appearance – The beer pours a clear golden-amber color with a small head of white foam. The head has fades quite quickly, leaving very little lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is quite heavy of a grainy and bready smell mixed with aromas of caramel and some harvest fruits. Along with these smells comes a little bit of hay and yeast as well as a bit of herb and earthiness.
Taste – The taste starts out with a crisp grainy and cracker malt flavor that has notes of caramel and toffee sweetness. There is a little bit of yeast and pear, with both of these getting lighter as the taste advances. At the same time, as the taste advances, light herbal and earthy flavors join in, all while the graininess gets a bit more potent. Toward the end of the flavor transitions comes some straw and a bit more toffee/caramel, leaving one with a rather pleasant and crisp taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average. For the style and the flavors, the feel is spot on and makes for a very nice drinker.
Overall – A nice easy drinking and flavorful marzen. For the $1.99 I paid for an imperial pint, you certainly can’t go wrong.",4.04
Tucher Festbier,"Can into pint glass. Pours a crystal-clear honey-gold color with a nice off-white head. Initial impression is bready malts, honey, and a touch of hops to offset the maltiness a little. Mouthfeel is medium - bordering on chewy. Finish is clean and refreshing, with lingering breadiness. Overall, a very drinkable Festbier - maybe a little heavy for sessioning, but I could easily drink a couple of these.",4.02
Tucher Festbier,"16 fl oz can from a ~$10 USD 4-pack.

5.8% ABV.

A bit too doughy in its yeast profile for me, distracting from the Munich malt honeyed sweetness. Too bready to be a beer I'd quaff by the litre (and quaffing by the litre is sort of the point of a festbier).

Still a nice brew, but not amongst the best German expressions of the style. This is currently rated #1 in the Festbier category, which I think is over-effusive, but it's drinkable and enjoyable, no doubt.

Tucher Festbier,"500 ml Can
Consumed on: 14 July, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 48.4 F


Look:
Golden yellow with a 2-finger frothy and pillowy white head. The head fades to about a half finger of bubbly foam. Lacing is good.

Smell:
Quite malty. Very bready and even doughy. There is a very light touch of honey and also lemon. Light touch of grass - both cut and uncut.

Taste:
Dialed down a notch or two from the nose but still quite good. Ant still malty. The malts come across as fresh baked bread and soft pretzels. The lemon note can be picked up in the background. There is a mild bitterness from the hops but it is just enough to cut into the malts and balance things out. The sip finishes very slightly dry. Very refreshing.

Feel:
Crisp and mostly clean. A tad chewy. Body is medium-light.

Overall:
A quite enjoyable and easy drinking Festbier. Nicely done. I could drink this all day long. This definitely earns its #3 rating (at the time of this review) and just might be my favorite Festbier to date.",4.3

A great Festbier",4.25
Tucher Festbier,"pours a crystal clear gold body with a white froth head that has moderate retention and leaves specs of thin sudsy lacing behind as it settles to a thin slightly murky cap with small halo

aroma is crystal clear malty caramel, layered with a pizza dough like fluff and mild pretzel

taste is plenty malty but not quite as complex as the aroma, although a slight hop bitterness hits towards the end to balance it

mouthfeel is high carbonation and medium-light body that runs somewhat watery but manages chewy and finishes crisp and dry with a lightly malty and earthy hopped aftertaste

overall:
the malt layers are very interesting, standing out pretty nicely, and the hopped finish is a great transition",4.2
Tucher Festbier,"Poured from the can into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Beaming brass yellow, with exceptional glass and mirror like clarity in the body, with light reams of carbonation. Head is bright white and fluffy looking, with a big four fingers and thick creamy retention and staying power. Just an all around bold and beautiful looking lager.

Real exceptional aroma. Big dough malts, and baked bread flavors, hints of light brown crust and exotic fresh milled grain. Kicks in a little pasty and sticky sensing, not the most clean but real solid and impressive nose.

Palate is real nice. Soft bodied moutfeel, light but like Spring water like consistency. A nice mid palate of toffee crispness that pushes all the right buttons. Finishes a bit dry grain, almost flour like, but much more flavors of caramel and soft toffee continue as the beer warms and drinking keeps flowing.

Real good festbier, will have to remember this one next time I see it.",4.27
Tucher Festbier,"a festbier from germany, thought i had previously tried most of them, so i was stoked to find this, been loving the style again this year and was eager to try an old world example of it, but this was a little disappointing, and while freshness may be part of the issue, this underwhelmed even aside from that, past mineral forward to almost metallic, thin, and pretty simple flavored by the lager yeast and some bittering hops, less malty than most, even as a festbier compared with a marzen lager, i can see a lot of potential for this, but it didnt hit for me the way i hoped it would, grabbed a four pack for all day drinking and ended up only having one can and moving on to some wet hop stuff, will circle back later this week, but it didnt take me where i wanted to go. i love the cans, label and size, and i love the price. the pour is pretty, clear and airy white headed, looks like a nice german helles, maybe a shade richer. the nose is light oxidation, aluminum, nutty european malt, and bread yeast to me, even lightly doughy, pretty minimal overall, noble hops there too, but its all relatively unexciting. the flavor follows, some grassiness from the hops, a tea note late, very dry throughout and not as flavorful on the grain side as it smells. the yeast its primary, along with the mineral profile, and overall it is missing something for me, maybe the crispness of a good helles, maybe the richness of a proper marzen, which i know this isnt, but its sort of in this middle ground or no mans land where its not quite defined. drinkable for sure, fizzy and lively in texture and quite light, but this just tastes a bit cheap to me, tired from its long journey here, and not a standout in the style unfortunately...

edit: upon further review, aka two more cans of this, i may have been a little too harsh on it, sure its a little thinner and lacks malt richness, but its not as metallic as i called it after the first one, more mineral forward to me now, and with pizza it was spot on. the freshness is still an apparent issue but the quality is higher than maybe i gave it credit for the first time around. bumping up a few scores now, context seems to be everything with this one...",3.62

Tucher Festbier,"500ml can into a pint glass. Dating hard to understand, but feel confident it is this years release.

Looking very good in the glass. Clear pale golden yellow body. Initial full white head shrinks to a collar and covering, scattered lacing.

Strong malty aroma, not an overly sweet smell.

On tasting, good malty taste, not too sweet. Well balanced, not so much with bitterness, though there is a hint of that, but by a strength and depth of flavor.

Mouth above medium, finish a little sweetness comes through, as does the abv.

Very good helles style Festbier.",4.22
Tucher Festbier,"500ml can poured into a dimpled mug.

A two finger white head caps the clear, rich gold pour. The very persistent head is comprised of both tight and loose soapy foam and leaves good lacing. The aroma is moderate strength, spicy hop over light toasted malt and some mineral notes. Taste is semi-dry and balanced slightly to hop front to back, bitterness is low but a mild bitterness does ring out in the brief aftertaste. Malt flavor is clean toasted malt while the hop flavor opens spicy and transitions to more floral with hints of citrus as the mug warms. Mouthfeel starts medium-light and crisp before smoothing to a heavier creamy finish. This is a great Oktoberfest though I find it a little sharp and the flavor profile to be more like a Marzen than a Festbier.",4.07
Tucher Festbier,"Golden amber body; excellent carbonation; thick and spongy white head, dense and rocky. Fine toasted malt nose.; a bit of earthy spiciness. Sublimely and subtly malty; toasted grain again. faint honey; low-key malt sweetness; low to moderate hop bitterness. Medium body; crisp and warm on the palate; nice touch of dryness at the finish.

Tucher Festbier,"A clear golden yellow color with a full head and nice white lacing. The nose is honey and grainy bread. It tastes of crackers, floral hoppiness, and pepper on the way out. This is so light and crisp. YUM! I could drink a few of these. Makes me want to eat.",3.83
Tucher Festbier,"This one pours a light orange-ish color, clear, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This one smells like grassy hops, honey, breadiness, and a bit of spice.

This has a light nice nuttiness and bready malt character, with a touch of grassy hop spice to it. I'd want a touch more crisp bite on the back end for the style, but it's still well done in this area of the Oktoberfest world.

This is light bodied, clean, crisp, and very drinkable, with a nice smooth finish.

This is a very nice pale take on the style.",4.03
Tucher Festbier,"From the bottom of the can: ""L 114710 10:10/02""

Appearance: The beer has a nice amber colored body with hints of burnished gold. Dark shadows with a very slight haze are visible through the body. The head is white and forms a solid disc of foam which become somewhat rocky as it fades. It had average retention and leaves a short white cap on top of the beer at all times. There are nice blotches of camouflage patterned lacing.

Aroma: There isn't a ton of aroma here; a mild cereal grain character giving off the impression of sweetness.

Taste: Up front there is a light bit of bread dough flavor. As it rolls along the sides of the palate towards the middle it picks up a light bit of spice. Mild alcohol note on the center of the tongue that is more noticeable at first but fades away while drinking the beer and between palate cleansing. Stale cracker character comes through a bit. A very mild herbal character towards the end of each sip but mostly absent of flavor at the finish and in the aftertaste.

Mouthfeel: It feels balanced on the edge of light and upper-light bodied depending on the sip. Very mellow bitterness. It is a very easy beer to drink.

Overall: This feels like a pretty average, lighter Festbier. It wouldn't be the first beer I would pick up for its aroma or flavor but it would be a decent beer to clank under a tent while dancing on benches or singing songs. It's not something I would buy again to drink at my house but I could drink it if that was what was being served at a tent.",3.11

Notes via stream of consciousness: So what do we have here? It's an Imperial chocolate peanut butter stout at 7.6% alcohol by volume. It doesn't say anything about ingredients on the label so it might just be flavoring. The body is an opaque brown-black and reveals only a glimmer of mahogany brown at the base of the glass when held to the light. The head is a finger's width of tan foam. In the nose I'm getting a lot of peanut and a little bit of milk chocolate. On to the taste... the nuttiness remains but it's no longer dominant. The chocolate that wraps around it is like a combination of milk chocolate and darker chocolate. They're clearly from a flavoring agent but that's fine by me as there are no weird or unusual notes to it. There's a light fruitiness to it as well but that's about it. It's not really roasty, and there's not a lot of bitterness to it. It's sweet but it's not overly sweet, and although you could easily serve this on it's own as a dessert beer or use it as an ingredient in something, you can just as easily enjoy it on its own. How quickly you'll work through it depends on how much you like the sweetness. For me the second half of the glass will definitely be a sipper. Thankfully they didn't add any lactose to it! In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. On that note, the head died down quicker than I'd have liked but it did leave some nice lacing about the glass so there's that. I think that this is a very nice beer that's fairly accessible. It's not too big nor is it too small, as in lacking flavor, and thus I think it should work for just about everyone. It is a bit one-sided though, but I guess it kind of has to be, right? I mean, they are going for a peanut butter cup thing, right? That's what the label implied to me. I generally buy a few special beers to enjoy on Halloween while the trick or treaters come and go, usually pumpkin beers, and this will make a nice change of pace.

All Hallows Treat,"Bought a pack of this so I'll definitely be able to revisit it. I hope my opinion changes because so far this is lowkey bad. There's not really a chocolate presence and smelled kind of astringent. The peanut butter is that typical peanut flour taste. Basically just seems like an off version of Left Hands PB Milk Stout which I also think could be better. It's also kind of fruity sweet? Idk. I hope I like it more as I get through it.


2nd can was a smidge better, not fantastic but none of that astringent smell or anything else super weird. Definitely liking it better.",3.61
All Hallows Treat,"Mercifully, these days, a pint can's contents can be emptied into a clear glass Imperial pint mug. Points should automatically be upgraded over the sea of starchy white foam ""heads"" brought by almost all modern ""IPAs"".There's a nice biege head on top of a liquid that's just a little lighter than the typical black coffee brown of a standard stout. The aroma is mostly dark chocolate and roasted peanuts. First off, this drinks less viscose than many stouts and much thinner than the dessert variety. That doesn't have to be a negative. One of the nice things about this brew is the subtleness of the peanut and chocolate flavor additions. They don’t totally override the Belgian Ale aspect, which keeps this in balance with the sweetness that usually accompanies this mixture. In a close decision, this is less sweet enough and has other characteristics that it shouldn't just be a categorized a dessert beer. There are other flavored stouts that deliver this combination of flavors, but they're usually heavy handed in doing so. This is a very pleasant option.",4.17

Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: low to mid 50s F


Look:
Cloudy and opaque but bright copper. I can distinguish the shadows of my fingers through the glass but not much else. Initial 3-finger creamy off-white head slowly dissipates to a thin but consistent cover. Very good lacing.

Smell:
Toasted (but lightly so) whole wheat bread and biscuits. Light notes of toffee or caramel along with a medium-dark honey. Also faint notes of grass.

Taste:
Wheat bread with toffee and a surprising but actually light spiciness. Very nice. A mild bitterness carries through the sip which finishes dry. The 6.2% ABV is not noticeable at all.

Feel:
Smooth and crisp. Body is medium with a step to the lighter side.

Overall:
This beer isn't your average Festbier/Wiesnbier. As others have stated, it is actually a light Märzen. Or perhaps a cross between a Märzen and a Festbier with more of the Märzen in the mix. And it works. This is a really nice Oktoberfest beer. It drinks well and would pair with German fest food nicely. Bitburger must have learned something from their Oktoberfest collaboration with Sierra Nevada in 2019. Well done, Bitburger! Well done!

Note: When I poured this beer, I noticed some sediment in the bottom of the bottle so I did the 'Hefeweizen Swirl' to get it back into solution in the beer.",4.02

Festbier,"For how cheap it is you'd think it was an upscale adjunct lager, lo' and behold it is a good Festbier for Oktoberfest. Not a strict marzen, not a run of the mill bavarian but spot on for the clean crisp taste of a fest bier. Smooth, good brewing water, good malts and good mouth feel. I give it a 4.25. The look I scored 4 because it was not as dark as your standard red lager, but it was not yellow like a 2-row barley crap we have in america. White head, and good aroma made the smell a 4. Taste was well worth the price, i would give this another go and lookforward to Festbeer season. I am stocking up this time.",4.3
Festbier,"Pours dark ruddy amber (SRM 12-13). This is much darker than expected and, surprisingly, is it not clear. One inch of creamy pancake batter has an antique white to almond color and is short lived, leaving small patches of lace on a Spaten dimpled mug.

Initially, the aroma is bright. It quickly turns to wheat bread, with toasted grains and light spiciness. With minimal warming, peanut husks come into focus.

While modest, the bitterness and spice are far stronger than expected. Malts still dominate, with mild sweetness. Light toasted grain is similar to cream of wheat. A long, lightly bitter finish is rather grainy. Peanuts show up, again with warmth. With more warmth comes the clear flavor of soft pretzels.

This one has a medium body and a rough texture. Alcohol is as expected, as is the soft carbonation. There is a light astringency throughout.

Bitburger's Festbier is a fine beverage. Still, it is a letdown, if only because I had expected more. It will pair well with soft pretzels and bratwurst, more likely sweet mustard than spicy.",3.84

Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Had on tap at Lucero's Tavern IV

On arrival, a 2 finger slightly fizzy head was present and slowly became rocky, but had a surprisingly good head retention, and formed lacing. Body is a brownish amber with lively fine carbonation.

I don't know if this is a shitty keg or what, but the aroma reminds me of pale super cheap bullshit malt liquor from Anhueser Busch. Super funky and really not clean at all. Aroma is reminiscent of gym socks with a vague hint of dark malt... maybe.

Taste is unfortunately similar to the aroma. This is like having sex in a canoe unfortunately, with a light malty heaviness that is easily confused for the funk that is present. This might even taste a bit skunky stupidly. I expected better.

Feel is slightly drying with a medium quick finish making all the bad parts of this beer not as bad, but a quick finish and high drinkability can't make up for the overall low quality in this beer. Decent feel but it's hard to feel good when you're smelling this.

Overall I'm not sure if this is just an old keg or if my bias against Dos Equis is justified, but this might be the worst Vienna Lager I've had in my life. I'd much rather have Victoria, or even Modelo Negra. Why does this exist? To be a light beer for people who don't want to bee seen drinking light beers?",2.83

Begins sweet but clean (mild carbonation), then mild caramel malt, and some nice mild (stone?) fruit, before a creamy, slightly-drying but mostly not-there finish.

Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Clear Jurassic amber with a moderate khaki foam head settling to a thick level blanket with a collar that leaves some thin drooping legs.

A firm carbonation delivers faintly toasty bread and hints of almond that go down swimmingly after a full day of hiking. A touch of tobacco comes out on the exhale after the just dry finish.

Ambar is really subtle and totally chuggable with no detectable off-notes, making for an overall better beer than their lager.",3.82
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"I never had the OG Ambar so I have no idea how this Especial is different. Well, this is not a Vienna Lager, at least that is clear. Obviously it tries to be a Dark Lager - it does remind you of that by the way it smells, looks and tastes. It does taste okay in the first monent but then BAM! it all starts fading away. A few minutes into the beer and it starts tasting and feeling like bitter water. And most of the time the arona was more like bread, no beer or hops, just bread.
Funny beer, I like Dos Equis for what it is, a cerveza. Maybe I should try the “real” ambar next - because this one wasn’t really cutting it.",3.46
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Best By date : June 2022. Labeled ""Ambar Especial"" . Assume this is the same beer, as it's got the same abv, & blurb on the bottom of the label .

Clear , slightly orangey chestnut-brown, with slight, quickly-dissipating light tan head.

Smell is slight toffee and caramel, with a bit of fresh biscuity malt aroma when swirled. Not bad, just not much there.

Taste is light toasted nuts, and slight bread crust. A bit of tang, and weak amaretto flavor shows up as it warms to 50F(+/-) . Again, not bad, just not much there.

Feel is light, smooth, and slightly watery just before the light, very,very fine carbonation kicks in. Drying finish, that lingers afterward.

Overall, not bad, and no off-flavors, just kind of weak. Inoffensive enough to enjoy, if no other decent options available, especially in hot weather. Certainly better than its corn-laden brethren in the Light Industrial Lager vein. I'd rather have Yuengling or Negra Modelo though. ymmv",2.9
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"Poured into a Seattle Beer Week pint glass. Pour a medium to dark coppery amber with fine, two finger white head with great retention and thick lacing. Aroma of grainy and bready malt, light grassy hops, a little bit minerally. Flavor starts with pale and lightly caramel malt with some evidence of corn, light grassy hops; finishes with light grassy hops and thin malt. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I actually picked this up when finding it singled, thinking it was the regular lager, which I hadn't reviewed. (It is now named ""Ambar Especial""). It looks and tastes better than I remember the regular Dos Equis, which was a mediocre adjunct lager. It looks great in the glass, aroma is OK and the taste starts pretty decent, but thins out quickly into a finish that is satisfactory but tastes almost watered down. Expectations were low, and this is pedestrian brewing, but I have to say I'd prefer this in a pinch over the thin grassy regular lager. Nothing special, but I would grab one at a restaurant if nothing else was appealing.",3.57
Dos Equis Ambar Especial,"12 ounce bottle in an Imperial style pint glass. It’s best by date is January 20, 2022 so i expect that it’s fresh.

Smell of sweet risen dough and roasted grain. There are caramel and grassy aromas, too.

Flavors of caramel malts and light grassy grain. No unpleasant aftertaste.

Export Lager,"On tap at The Sheffield in Brighton, NY.

This one pours a golden vibrant yellow color, with a small head, and lots of lacing.

This smells like biscuity and not too sweet malt, peppery hops, dough, and some grassiness.

This is two lager kings working together – of course it’s gonna be excellent. It’s got a real tight malt character to it – slightly doughy, toasty, and biscuity, with a light but well balanced grassy and slightly peppery hop character.

This is light bodied, super crisp and well attenuated, with a fantastic drinkability.

It’s hard to find much flaw here – East Coast lager excellence paired with Rocky Mountain lager excellence. What could go wrong?",4.43
Export Lager,"Pours a clear, rich golden color with a gorgeous fluffy white head that lasts, falling to a quarter inch cap with tenacious cling to the glass.

Sweet and toasty hits the nose first. It's a honey-like sweetness. The hops are floral and herbaceous with a slight grassiness and a very faint spiciness.

The taste opens slightly sweet with a bready malt flavor. Then there's a bunch of kids in this pool. The malt carries through, but there is a fairly strong hop note that leans more floral than the nose suggests. There's still some herbal grassiness, but not very pronounced. The sweetness starts to lean towards honey or maybe light brown sugar, and in the aftertaste it is almost a caramel flavor. There's just a hint of orange that I still don't notice in the smell, and the finish leaves a little peppery tingle behind that gets a little more pronounced on repeat sips. Everything rides on that malt backbone, though. It does have that flavor I am beginning to associate with decoction brewing but can't quite nail down - I suspect there's some browning reactions in that cooking process that bolster the toasted maltiness.

Light bodied, moderately carbonated, and the self-replenishing head lends it a slight foamy feel. Mildly bitter, fairly crisp, highly drinkable at 5.7%. Very nicely balanced on all the attributes.

Wow...not disappointed in this one at all. Worthy.",4.21

Pours a cloudy deep gold with 3 fingers of soapy white head that slowly fades to a thin cap and leaves decent lacing

It’s wonderfully toasty and sweet in the nose, but there’s still a nice bite to it. I’m picking up on aromas of toasted grain, sweet honey, bready malt, herbal hops, orange zest, and light pepper

It leans a bit more into the sweeter aspect in taste which I don’t prefer but it’s still quite good. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting bready malt, honey, herbal hops, dark toast, white pepper, toffee, and light orange rind. The swallow brings notes of toasted grain, sweet honey, bready malt, floral hops, white pepper, and light brown sugar

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and refreshing beer. Finishes mostly dry with a slight hop bite

Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Deeply, perversely curious as to how a brewery as old and established as fucking Warsteiner rolls out a new product to appease us American pigs.

I associate the phrase ""Brewer's Gold"" with Brewer's Gold hops, which were once probably genuinely used in Ballantine Ale and then became a weird trademark that had absolutely nothing to do with the Ballantine that was on the market by the time I was alive. Accordingly, my idiot brain expected this to be Ballantine-colored. Friends, it was not. It is instead the color of a very nice bock, and even then that blows my mind expectation-wise because this is listed as Zwickel, which I always thought was like pilsenser-colored but cloudy. You learn something every day.

Aroma is great, but light. Smells like an excellent American marzen. Like Staghorn, or pre-takeover Millstream Oktoberfest. only a bit dim. Nutty, rounded.

Tastes quite good. Malt-heavy, and unapologetically so. Toasted bread up front, getting sweeter in the middle, caramel and a bit of honey, drying up near the end but never quit letting the hops shines through because they don't need to. Tastes fortifying. This is the sort of beer that people in the 1800's would have thought was health food.",4.29
Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep orange color with a strong and lacy white head. SRM of 13. (4.00)

Aroma: Strong aromas of rich bread malts, toasted malt, brown German bread. Caramel, honey. Earthy yeast underneath.

Flavor: Strong earthy flavors of German bread. Rich brown bread loaf. A strong honey and caramel malt flavor in the middle. A malty finish with a lingering earthiness and toasted malt flavor underneath. Finishes malty and leans sweet from the rich honey.

Feel: Heavier-bodied. Moderate carbonation to balance

Compared to Weihenstephaner 1516 8/13/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More rich bread, honey. Less delicate lemon and dry grains. Larger bodied, darker, sweeter.

Compared to Summit Twin Pils 8/13/22: Pours a darker color. Stronger aromas. More malty rich bread, honey. Less lemongrass and dry grains and yeast. Larger bodied, darker, sweeter.

Overall: This beer packs a punch and a little darker than most kellerbiers. Rich bread and honey. Rich and toasty like a Marzen lager. Nice rich bready flavors though like a Zwickel. Delectable and fantastic for a German beer, but darker than I expected. (Rating: 4.06)",4.06

Notes via stream of consciousness: After having a few of the softer, less bitter beers from southern Germany I need a little more bitterness and I think this beer from Warsteiner which is in northern Germany will do the trick. It's poured a hazy (it's unfiltered) deep copper colored body beneath a short head of creamy off-white foam. The aroma is surprisingly malty with toasted bread and some caramel. The taste follows suit adding in a touch of honey and a delicate background of dark skinned fruits and subtle spice. A moderate bitterness balances it, and I guess I was way wrong on this one because it's more malty than bitter. Still, it finishes mostly dry as the majority of the malt fades quickly but it does linger with golden and medium-red caramel and a touch of honey and dark fruit. In the mouth it's medium leaning towards medium-full in body and creamy smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. I was really wrong about this one because it's so different than their other beers and I wonder how it's selling in Germany. I saw plenty of advertising for it in October of 2021 but I never found it anywhere. My guess is that it will end up selling better outside of Germany. Anyway, it's a great beer in my opinion and I'm going to keep it on my radar.

Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Nice copper color. Nose is cereal grains, malty, caramel. Taste almost follows exactly. I also get some nuttiness, toffy, and toasted malt. It's OK for what it is. I wish they came in 12 ounce cans instead of the 11.2 ounces.",3.43
Warsteiner Brewers Gold,"Very pretty hazy copper amber with two fingers of sudsy tan head that fade fast and leave almost zero lacing. The aroma is quite muted - faint caramel and citrus for sure; anything else is too faint to tell whether I'm imagining it or not. The flavour is surprisingly muted for a Kellerbier. Can't taste any yeast esters. I get caramel malt, citrus hops, a nice smooth finish with a bit of flavour, and that's about it. The pretty appearance and the smooth and balanced mouthfeel are all this one has going for it. Compared to the Hacker-Pschorr Kellerbier, this is a bland and boring disappointment. However, taken purely as a lager, it's drinkable and there's nothing nasty about it. Just don't bother going out of your way to try this.",3.29

If you have ever been drunk in a beer garden, however, you know I could easily have forgotten or overlooked it.
Amber gold with good retention to the last sip.
I’m not being a jerk but the word is lager. Aromas of hearty breads, mineral water, kinda caramel sweetness. A tiny hint of hops.
Definitely “natural” earthy malt flavors with a respectable but subdued (as it should be) hop bite. A few reviews mention minerals and, man, that’s right on. That water… you will never taste it outside of bottled beverages unless you visit Europe.
I’m calling it medium. Easy to take long draws off of this. It’s all marzen, a real feel for the style and I would have guessed the ABV at 5% tops.
This is an excellent beer if you like the style and a pleasant, fun beer if you are kinda ambivalent about it. Nothing world class here but definitely close to outstanding and really makes me pine for October coolness.",4.24

The feel is closer to medium than high in thickness. It's slightly creamy. Carbonation is medium and tickles the tongue. Astringency is slightly less than medium. It's a fairly dry beer with a great mouth feel..
Overall, it's outstanding with a world class feel.",4.22
Oktoberfest Märzen,"A: Pours a perfectly clear ruby/amber color. A two finger white head forms with good retention initially. That recedes to a ring after a minute with some lace left behind.
S: A biting mineral quality up front in the nose. That I'm pleased with, and leads to a bit of grape like esters. Toasted malts and grains. Light earthy, Noble hops in the finish.
T: Again, that minerality is up front, and I like that. Toasted malts, grains, sweet English biscuits. A Noble hop earthiness. Fairly simple, but very enjoyable.
M/O: A medium body with effervescent carbonation. Crisp, supper clean and finishes semi dry. Incredibly moreish, and I can down this in big gulps.

I'm surprised I haven't reviewed this before, but I have it most every year. A spot on example of the style IMO, and should be expected. Less is definitely more here, and I just want to keep coming back. Well done as always.",4.08

Oktoberfest,"Poured an orange-tinted golden body with decent head that quickly dies without leftover lace. Smell is basically some dirty, floral hops and a touch of ""lagerness"". Smooth, easy to drink, not much in the flavor department, just a bit of earthy hoppiness with a dry finish that is balanced with a decent maltiness (a light to medium body). It's not bad, and it's cheap, so nothing special but you could do worse in the oktoberfest beer department.",3.72
Oktoberfest,"Poured from a non-freshness dated 12 oz. bottle: this is quite an attractive pour with a bright, deep golden to amber/copper hue with a sustained, off-white, and foamy head.

One thing was quite noticeable in the aroma: this one has an almost syrupy-sweet aroma, unlike the other Oktoberfest beers I have tried this season.

The beer is quite sweet with some surprising bitterness that balances the malt and keeps this one from drifting into cloying territory. It is a very flavorful beer, but it is really not an Oktoberfest in the classic sense - it comes across as a hyped-up version of Yuengling's ""Traditional Lager"" which is bad as I quite enjoy that one. The mouthfeel is slightly chewy with a short-lived, clean aftertaste. Again, no my idea of a festbier but still enjoyable.",3.77
Oktoberfest,"From the bottle, it pours a clear amber color with a modest off-white head that soon diminishes to anice ring and leaves a little lacing. Roasted malt in the nose, Roasted malts in the mouth with a touch of caramel.",3.46
Oktoberfest,"Pours a dark, but crystal clear, amber color. Thick, three finger, tan head forms on the beer, lingers, then dissolves.

Aroma has notes of nutty malts, caramel, some light bready notes, a touch of spicy hops, and a slight fruity, estery note,

Taste has notes of bready malts, a touch of caramel, a light nuttiness with a mild sweetness that has some brown sugar and caramel notes.

Feel is light, a tad watery, but easy drinking. Moderate carbonation. Drier finish.

Overall this is a solidly mediocre oktoberfest that is more enjoyable to drink than my review/rating would imply.",3.28
Oktoberfest,"See through and copper colored with a thinning offwhite head, looks decent for the style. Sweet malt on the nose with some ‘Saz’ type hops in the back, going pretty well so far. Not bad, a bit light on the flavor but a long bready finish with some slight bite is what I like most about this beer. As far as this brewery goes, this offering is fairly decent. Medium body with above average carbonation. Good.",3.65
Oktoberfest,"12 ounce bottle poured into a dimpled mug.

Clear, orangish amber and wearing a three quarter inch khaki cap, it looks like a good marzen. The aroma is light but nice. mostly bread and to a lesser degree, caramel malt with a whiff of spicy hop aroma. Taste is much the same but flavor is restrained and seems overly attenuated. Body is on the light side of medium with medium high carbonation. I find this one rather dry and crisp for style, though a decent enough drinking beer.",3.43

Oktoberfest,"2022 Review: They may have changed the recipe this year to a more malty version, but it's definitely not as good as their original Oktoberfest. This one used to be great! (2022 Rating: 3.71)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Appearance: Pours a clear, but bright orange color that resembles fire. A strong white head. SRM of 13. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of earthy honey, flower, bread, grass and lemonflower. A predominately honeyflower component. (4.00)

Flavor: Holy Honey! Follows with a strong earthy honey and a sweet white bread component. Some light grass & flower on the end, but finishes with a glazed honey sweetness. More pale rather than caramel malts. Not dry. Pale and sweet witha slightly flowery finish. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Low to moderate carbonation. Finishes sweet and leaves a smooth honey consistency on the palate. (3.75)

Compared to Breckenridge Brewery's Oktoberfest 2020, 10/11/20: Pours a lighter, more orange color. Milder aromas. Aroma/flavor has more earthy honey. Less caramel and toastiness. More honey smoothness and less bitter.

Compared to Paulaner Oktoberfest 2020 10/28/20: Pours a lighter, less bronze color. More honey/flowery aromas. Less authentic German bread malt. More lemoflower.

Compared to Great Lakes Dortmund Gold 11/8/20: Pours a similar color. Stronger lemon, German white bread on the aroma. Less earthy and resinous honey and forest floor.

Compared to Bells' Oktoberfest 9/6/21: Pours slightly lighter. More honey and lemonflower. Less toasty and bread malts. Hoppier and lighter, but stronger flavor.

Compared to Pearl Street Lederhosen Lager 9/17/21: Pours an identical color. Similar aromas. Slightly more honey and lemonflower. Less orange and toasty/bready malts. Silghtly more pale, but more similar than I expected.

Compared to Utepils Receptional Oktoberfest 11/14/21: Larger head, similar color. More citrus and flower upfront. Less toasted bread malt. More toasted pine and caramel on the finish. Winner: Surly
9/12/22: Larger head. More bread and floral notes. Less citrus spice. Slightly dryer and cleaner. Similar.

Overall: Quite a good Oktoberfest lager. Classic Surly Lemonflower hop and yeast flavors with sweet honey here. A more pale and traditional festbier, on par with the festbier style rather than Americanized Marzen. Almost drinks similar to a Dortmund Gold or Surly Hell on a bit of steroids. A fantastic beer here and I'm glad Surly went with a traditional festbier style this time. (Final Rating: 4.13)

Oktoberfest,"This is a solid Oktoberfest, nothing remarkable but well made and nicely balanced. At 6% it's just a touch high for the style, but I suppose that's more a nod to American style than what you'd get in Germany. I'd try other beers from this brewery if I see them in my area.",4.0

Oktoberfest,"Too hoppy for the style.
Too fruity, tastes more like a pale ale than a lager.
In my opinion, there are way better options in this style out there.
It was good to try, but wouldn't seek it out again.

What is it with American breweries hopping the shit out of European beer styles?

Looking very nice in the glass. Slightly hazy pale golden yellow body. Small white head shrinks to a fat ring and covering, leaves rings of lacing.

Aroma is on the floral side, nicely malty.

On tasting though, it's more on the fruity side of things. Light hoppiness still present. Quite sweet as well. A little drying right at the end.

Mouth above medium, a little sharp. Finish a drying light bitterness.

Overall, pretty nice festbier. Would be interesting to try a fresher one to see if the usual Surly hop profile overwhelms. As it stands though, a tasty sessionable fall beer.",3.94
Oktoberfest,"Bought in one of two Binny's Pick Six, conveniently putting O-fests on three shelves for my easy preparation for the BA three week O-Fest thread. (Of which I made three entries and, generally, thought it worthwhile to study my O-Fest habit.)

Surly is a third generation crafter (basically, those that got their start in this century's first decade) that specializes in using hops, too many for my malt-head mouth. So I am not surprised that Surly's marzen is, well, hoppy for this malty style. Probably only in its third release, I'd hope (but don't expect) its fourth release will use hops to achieve balance instead of prominence.",3.35
Oktoberfest,"From a 12oz can:

Appearance: Clear gold, good head.

Smell: Mild sweetness, toast.

Taste: Very tasty combination of sweetened bread and light grassy hops. A good drinker, easy to have a few.

Overall: Been on a Octoberfest kick, so picked up a 12 pack of Surly's version. I don't think it's a marzen, more of a weisn. Nice sweetness balanced by a grassy hop that is not too much for the style.",4.12

Oktoberfest,"Clear, pale amber hue, slim white head.

In the nose: Cool and malty. Noble hops, with a floral touch. Slightly spicy.

In the mouth: Clear and crisp, with a zesty edge. Earthy malt flavors, boards the palate and hangs out at the back. Twist of fruit, kiss of hops, rich and malty turning clean and refreshing. Ends on a lightly dry note, a bready finish. Just enough malty flavors meets just enough easy-drinking to keep the celebration going.

Do I like it better than the beer it replaced, SurlyFest, which was not in the least a traditional märzen? No. SurlyFest was too unique and special not to love. Do I like it more than other Oktoberfests? It falls squarely in the middle. Short answer: good märzen and you can drink it. Nothing wrong with that. Nothing great about it, either.",3.73

Mild caramel malt and grassy hop with a touch of bready yeast.

Neutral taste with low bitterness, toasted malt shines. Apple, attempting to be sweet is the only taste other than malt and faint hops. Cracker and toasted malt stand out over bread and dough. The finish is quick, crisp and clean and on the dry side. Bitterness builds to average during the lingering aftertaste.

Medium light bodied and perfectly carbonated. Alcohol is very well hidden. Smooth and session-able, balanced and true to style. Not as dark and sweet as Beers labeled Marzens, not as hoppy as many Festbier. Right in the middle.",3.79

M - Medium body with a little bit of thinness around the edges and some alcohol warming in the back of the throat on the first few sips.

O - Needs a little more chocolate roast and less Bourbon presence.",4.0
Imperialis,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer ours a deep brown, nearly black color with a one finger head of brown foam. The thickness of the brew can be seen when swirling the beer in the glass. Thick sticky fingers of beer cling to the sides of the glass upon swirling, with the slowly receding to the bottom of the snifter. The head that was present upon pouring fades rather fast, leaving a light level of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is massive of a rich roasted and toasted malt smell that is accompanied by tons of chocolate and sweet caramel and molasses. Along with these aromas comes a nice bourbon and woody smell that has notes of leather and smoke mixed within. Other sweeter smells of prune and plum as well as a good showing of vanilla.
Taste – The taste starts out with a semi sweet cocoa and heavily roasted and toasted malt flavor. The sweet upfront is mainly of the brown sugar and molasses nature but has a little bit of a dark fruit flavor of raisin and prune. There is a nice presence of a smooth vanilla flavor as well, that compliments the sweet rather nicely. Right from the start, the bourbon and oak can be appreciated as well, both of which get stronger as the taste advances forward on the tongue. Along with the bourbon getting stronger, so too comes a bit of bitter coffee and some char flavors. At the end the bourbon, oak, and char surge and are accompanied by a bit of leather, leaving one with a nice rich, not too sweet, but nice and warming taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is thick and creamy with a carbonation level that is low. For the mix of dark, roast, booze, and sweet the feel is great and makes for one nice pleasant sipper.
Overall – A rather nice bourbon barrel aged stout. Rather balanced, as it is not too heavy in any one of its flavor attributes. Overall, very nice.",4.16
Imperialis,"Its quite odd to see a barrel-aged series beer from Avery to be so light, ordinary and normal. Simply an Imperial Stout aged for only six months in those barrels, this mere 12.7% stout shows quite the restraint.

Very dark brown and flirting with blackness, Imperialis kicks off with a light tan skirt of froth. With a roasty, toasty, spicy and cola-like scent, the beer's aromatics hinge on chocolate, booze soaked oak, dark fruit, vanilla and caramel. Similarly in taste, its early impressions are robust and sweet with caramel, vanilla, toasted coconut, chocolate and dry molasses.

The spices quickly take over the sweetness as the dark ale embarks upon the middle palate. Malt dominance dries to a coffee, cocoa and cola nut character for a taste that backs off of the heavy and robust char of espresso or campfire. Moderately bitter in a late and woodsy impression, the oak tannins and booze flavors leave a late taste of vanilla, cola, roasted red grape and lacquer on the tongue.

Full bodied but not as heavy as those that we have become accustomed, there's a relaxed sense of drinkability that comes with the slightly lackluster stout. Finishing nutty, spicy and with a long Kona-like coffee flavor, the ale is basically a beer's version of affogato in a glass.",4.0

Imperialis,"Not my favorite Avery stout, but a good bargain and about what I expected for the price. The nearly black color and brown foam is quite enticing. The taste is mostly oaken bourbon and vanilla and cherry, with roasted malts and char, ethanol, slight sweetness, and a hint of chocolate. Its a bit boozy and has some rough edges. Addition of something like cherries or chocolate would probably take this over the top, but as is it is quite nice and grows on you as you drink it.",4.04
Imperialis,"Deep, dark brown body, opaque; thick and densely spongy head, light khaki color; thick, sticky sheets of foam curtain the glass. Rich, dark chocolate and cocoa aroma; very light char note. Rich dark malt flavor; baker's and milk chocolate plus cocoa; bold whiskey presence; low bitterness; moderate alcohol phenol presence; very light oak note. Heavy mouthfeel yet soft and velvety on the palate; huge boozy heat offsets the residual sugars.

This is a very likeable barrel aged imperial stout. The base beer is righteous while the bourbon barrel character cuts through like a healthy neat shot of your favorite straight whiskey. Maybe a little hot on the palate, but I'm thinking some judicious bottle aging will mellow this one out for the better.

Good Gourd,"Canned on 8-1-22. 12oz can poured into a tulip.

Pours a glowing auburn with some haze; fluffy light khaki head that falls leaving solid retention and lacing.

The aromas have some interesting Belgian characteristics leading the way. Some banana and bubblegum coming through which I wasn't expecting. Some caramel. Some veggies. Not much pumpkin spice going on. Malts are there.

The flavors are pretty unique and bolder than the nose. Some cinnamon sugar coming through. More banana and bubblegum. More caramel along with some hints of cocoa. Some sweet potatoes. There's a pretty solid earthiness and bitterness to this one. Decent sweetness. Solid malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is ultimately well hidden.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. It's thick, fluffy, creamy, and slightly sharp.

The mouthfeel is smooth and well into the medium range.

The feel is full bodied with soft carbonation. Creamy and very smooth. The alcohol is extremely well-hidden.

Good Gourd,"I just had the Saint Arnold Pumpkinator a few days ago and this concoction by Cigar City sits right behind that gem at #2. I think that ranking is fair. This brew is interesting with the cloves, cinnamon, vanilla and all spice creating a beautiful medley for the pumpkin to nestle into. This is an 8.5 ABV beer which hides it very well.

Good Gourd,"DATE: November 8, 2020... OCCASION: wrapping up a great four-day weekend with a beer I have hoped to taste for a while now--great to see Cigar City here up in Jersey... GLASSWARE: Maudite snifter... a foreboding, brownish purple body that shows lively bubbles swelling into an uneven haze of off-white head--this pumpkin looks like it has more of a Halloween attitude than one of Thanksgiving... rich punch of cinnamon, nutmeg, sharp brown sugar, candied clove and all spice evoke a dessert-like aroma.... not much in the way of maltiness suggested by its aroma... first sip is rich, creamy, buzzing at the teeth and the throat, with a boozy finish that lingers warmly... in fact, it stays so long between sips, it seems like one long drink, commanding with a whiskey's confidence but drawing without heat or penalty.... what a beautiful experience this is--the cinnamon and nutmeg explode atop a brown ale's malty base, with clove and light citrus also in the mix... in fact, the late citrus makes this almost read as a whiskey with bitters... big, bold but accessible, I will look for this again next year, and appreciate having CC in Northeastern distribution--this works quite well as a holiday dessertif or a nightcap....",4.29
Good Gourd,"My can reads 8.8% ABV, for whatever that's worth. Pours dark red with a rather large tannish head which laces up nicely as it recedes. Looks pretty nice. Smells of lightly singed brown sugar, booze, gourd (duh!) and the requisite spices, none of which particularly stand out. They're all there, though: cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, allspice and cumin (I kid). Tastes quite delightful, if mildly boozy. I mean, this is a hacky thing to say, but it's pumpkin pie in liquid form. I taste some vanilla, too. Don't know if that's listed as an ingredient, but it's definitely there on the tongue. The spices kind of linger a bit; perhaps too long. Your mileage will certainly vary. Pretty well full-bodied with a dry finish. I'm less crazy about this style with every passing year, but I like this one quite a bit.",3.88
Good Gourd,"Absolutely terrific pumpkin ale...Schlafly is the standard bearer but this is really good...

Lots of pumpkin pie spice without being annoying about it...it tastes like a good slice of pumpkin pie...and as far as I'm concerned that's is a good thing.

Creamy and smooth...terrific finish...not boozy at all...

I will grab some of this for Thanksgiving....",4.5
Good Gourd,"Canned on 7/13/20

Pours a deep maroon-mahogany body with just a touch of clarity and topped with a finger of rocky, semi-creamy foam; great head retention recedes slowly to some spotty islands of cap, a firm, creamy ring of collar, and a comprehensive, webbed array of lacing clinging across the glass.

Aroma features a quieted, raw boozy aspect introducing more subdued seasonal notes; soft pie spice, fleeting sense of roasted cloves, squash, allspice, and vanilla for a thinly veiled sweeter quality; light tones of pumpkin comes in waves, balanced by brown sugar into the close.

Taste opens a touch bready, with hints of caramel reinforcing a light malt profile as notes of squash/pumpkin chunks and brown sugar become increasingly prominent over the mid-palate, while nutmeg and cinnamon fade with a boozy finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium body with an expansive, rounded carbonation trending slick across the mid-palate and with a crispness that tingles into the back end; a smooth yet weighty finish highlights a minor pang of booziness and distant vegetal acridity that had been advancing across the palate, though in pleasant synchronicity with the beer's softer elements.

There's extensive balance beneath the subdued profile and overarching booziness, but not quite prominent enough to see this one through; a roller coaster of a pumpkin ale, with heavy promise but a contrastingly weaker execution leaving a drinkable though unimpressive final impression.",3.45
Good Gourd,"a: rich, dark cherry and brown color with hints of dark amber and mahogany. pours a nice frothy solid 2 finger tan head that settles around 1/2 finger

t: tons of brown sugar, pie crust, cinnamon, clove, and cardamom in here. extremely rich. brown sugar, pumpkin & squash meat. pumpkin pie filling. lots of nutmeg

m: fuller side of medium. carbonation is medium

o: a very nice Pumpkin Ale. it's pie-like, but not overly sweet or spicy. very rich, yet not tough to drink. really good stuff, could use a bit more out of the aroma though",4.11
Good Gourd,"Four ounces served from an can into an Erdinger Oktoberfest stein during my second decennial pumpkin beer tasting.

Banana and assorted pumpkin spice nose. Long coffee finish with that signature Cigar City heavy mouthfeel of their Imperial beers. Balanced sweetness to scale with the imperial concept.",4.25
Good Gourd,"Ths is a super pumpkin ale I sampled first last night with my brother outside on my parent's porch until the wee hours. Obviously the beer was delicious,as my brother had promised it would be. I am rewinding tonight with the one surviving beer.

For me, the spices hit more or less perfectly, the cinammon and nutmeg staying on your tongue well into theftertaste. The rest is incredibly complimentiary, understated, and balanced. The bright, satisfying maltiness is only elevated by the pumpkin flavors. This doesn't mash you on the head with heavy sweetness and become riddled with booze flavors like some of the better, more ""traditional"" pumpkins. Hard to believe its packing so much alcohol. Just outstanding.",4.49
Good Gourd,"Upon pouring, my first thought is, this beer is perfectly coordinated with the can as if they were wearing matching outfits. The tan head with etchings of tawny mimics the top of the can. The liquid itself, however, is more cinnamon/copper than anything close to a vibrant orange. I'd call it syrupy looking maintaining a certain seasonality.

What makes one pumpkin pie better than the others? Crust, spice mix, sweeteners, binding agents, quality of pumpkin. First thought on aroma, this doesn't remind me of a pie. More like a pumpkin cake (your typical muffin nowadays) with a brown sugar/butter/cinnamon streusel top. More like a pumpkin crumb cake I'd have with a cup of coffee in the morning.

Will the taste depart from the brown sugar/cinnamon? Somewhat. Brown sugar is the main sweet element. Pumpkin is there, and helped by a hopping with subtle notes of citrus, black pepper and nutmeg. Tastes a little like raw pumpkin smells...a bit bitter. Coffee grounds, clementine, lavender. If that doesn't sell you...it ends up tasting down a like a slightly watered down Captain Morgan Black with a dollop of pumpkin cream; so, really outstanding in terms of a pumpkin beer.

Medium body with a little chewiness in the middle. Rather dense impression followed swiftly by tart elderberry.",4.15
Good Gourd,"Excited to try this highly rated beer. Deep copper see through color to this brew with a good sized tan head. Head fading quickly but a nice look none the less. Initial nose is sweet with some pumpkin and related spices. A further scent of the can really brings out a rich deep nose. Ok, really like the balance and smoothness of this brew. The evenness allows the spices to take center stage before the bite pulls it away with a drying finish. This slightly vanilla sweet yet bitter brew has a medium body and enough carbonation to keep me happy. I’ve got to admit, this stuff is pretty good here.",4.34
Good Gourd,"I was a bit disappointed by this beer which has excellent reviews.

There is definitely the pumpkin flavor, the spice, nutmeg and cinnamon in the taste profile.

None of the flavors are pronounced. There isn’t a richness of flavor I’ve experienced in other pumpkin beers- especially Pumking.

Excellent beer, but not a standout in the style for me.",4.02
Good Gourd,"I am a huge pumpkin fan, and am having trouble finding some familiar favorites in this Covid-plagued year. So, knowing Cigar Citys' reputation, I bought a case of Good Gourd, without even tasting it. This beer met my expectations.. a great purchase! It pours a gourgeous, dark copper, with a bit more head than your average pumpkin. The carbonation level was ample.. the taste, wonderful. The tyical autumn spices are all there, and they are proportioned superbly. They create a slightly bitter presence, which is nicely offset by a noticeable vanilla sweetness, which forms a distinctly sweet caramel note. There is nothing rashly scientific or groundbreaking here.. simply a blend of fine ingredients woven together by a brewer that works their craft superbly. This is a great addition to my yearly pumpkin haul, and I strongly urge you to giver it a try!",4.37
Delicious IPA,"Appearance - Pours a golden amber with three fingers of bubbly white head.

Smell - citrus, earthy, piney, and floral hops, grapefruit and citrus peel, lemon, bready malts, caramel, and earthy yeast.

Taste - citrus, earthy, piney, and floral hops upfront although it's predominately citrus and piney hops, bitter pine resin and grapefruit and citrus peel come through next. The lemon is there but is overpowered by the hops. The bready malts, caramel, and earthy yeast round out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky with the pine resin and grapefruit peel lingering.

Overall - A solid example of a true West Coast IPA. The pine resin and hops are spot on in this one and the ABV is well hidden. A pleasant recommendation from Stacey; one of the owners of Collective here in Cowtown!",4.35
Delicious IPA,"Appearance: Pours a golden color with pale hues when held up to the light. Medium to high carbonation, with a thick white foam head.

Taste: A bitter punch of citrus peel up front. Some piney Notes, and grapefruit in the back. The finish is not exactly clean but it doesn't linger too long either. Simple and well balanced.

Overall: this is a nice, clean, simple brew of commendable quality. I found it to be quite refreshing and enjoyable. It is significantly drinkable, despite the bitterness.. which I actually find to be pleasing on the palate. This is my first run with this beer, and it's definitely not gonna be the last.",4.27

Delicious IPA,"Oh no, a gluten-free beer? Ugh totally didn't notice that on this 19.2oz can. Pouring in a pint glass. Crystal clear and medium golden brass in color, with a nice white foam. Flavor is incredibly crisp with a pleasantly sharp citrus pith bite, evoking lemon and grapefruit. Beyond that flavor profile there's no additional bitterness, and it finishes remarkably clean considering. Malt body is vanishingly thin which is not a surprise for any number of reasons.

Dated 04/04/22 enjoy by 08/02/22.",3.78
Delicious IPA,"Pours a golden amber in color with minimal head and lacing as you drink. Carbonation looks average. Reminiscent of a Stone IPA, but with less head.

Aroma is not overly pungent, perhaps I should let it warm a bit (the malts come through a bit more as it warms, but otherwise much of the same). Picking up notes of citrus and tropical fruits with some earthiness, spice and a hint of bubble gum in the background. Alcohol is slightly detectable at 7.7% ABV.

Flavor is very predominantly hops across the full spectrum. Starts off with a little bit of balance with the toasty, biscuity malts and quickly climaxes with a pine resin and grapefruit rind hop avalanche that coats the tongue. I'd imagine the malts are a bit subdued due to the gluten reduction process. This is certainly a palate wrecker, but it's pretty tasty.

Mouthfeel is on the heavier side of medium bodied with smooth, zesty carbonation and a ton of chewiness. She thicc. The hop oil definitely coats the tongue after the swallow. I would not want to drink more than a few of these for fear of a hangover, but I quite enjoy the mouthfeel otherwise.

Overall this is a powerfully hoppy, reduced gluten brew. If you're not into hops, this is definitely not for you, but if you are, it is has a very fresh and pungent hop flavor that is sure to please. I think I prefer the Stone IPA over this one, but I definitely wouldn't turn it down if offered. Even with the high hoppiness it feels pretty gentle on the stomach. Another good one from Stone, cheers!",3.99
Delicious IPA,"A medium dark golden amber is immediately noticeable upon the pour. Medium sized head formed with some lacing remaining. This is definitely a lemony, citrusy IPA. It's more like a floral lemon than a grapefruit citrus, but it is noticeable bitter to the point of being resinous, as there is an IPA bite that is bitterly refreshing with a full bodied carbonated feel which borders on syrupiness. There is a noticeable lack of maltiness between the hopiness, which could be a result of the gluten reduction, but who knows. It's very boozy, you could feel the booze hit you on the first sip. Overall it was as described, but the lack of malt may have deprived some padding from bitterness. A purveyor of hops would enjoy.

Blue Hen Pilsner,"It's a beer. I tried the same brewery's 90 Minute IPA (an easy almost-all-fives beer) for the first time right before this one, so maybe the bar is just too high now, but this is... it's a beer. I feel much the same way about this as I do Blue Moon and all the Samuel Adams beers: It's by no means bad, I get why it's on the shelf, and it is what it says it is. But I find myself yearning for something more, and especially with Dogfish Head, I've come to expect something more.
Straw-colored with disappointing head and no lacing. Smells sweet, tastes sweet. Fruity, almost, but not quite- something in my head goes ""strawberry?"" but then goes ""huh. no"". No comment on the malt. It's there. More malt character would be nice. The flavor is fine, but one-dimensional, and then there's an indescribably funny aftertaste. I was hoping for layers, and I did not get them. Mouthfeel's a mixed bag. It's nicely carbonated. I wish it was lighter.
A very middling pilsner. I'll finish the can, but probably won't buy it again.",2.84

Blue Hen Pilsner,"been some time since i had a new dogfish head beer, this is a cool pils, done with delaware grain, not sure i knew that was a thing. its a pretty basic beer, especially for these guys, but it is supremely well made and a real drinker, a good addition to their lineup and one that should stick around, a smart and appropriate entry point sort of beer for these guys. golden in the glass with pretty good clarity and an average height but fading white head. it smells awesome, somewhat more robust than a lot of these, and still kind of european on the grain even though it isnt, it has deep earthiness, even some german sort of dustiness to it, and to me seems fresher and higher in minerals than a lot of these, bold but still not heavy, if that makes sense. the yeast is also a little bit european, obviously a lager strain and obviously patiently worked, and the taste and mouthfeel confirm what the aroma suggests. the hops are pretty reserved, especially for these guys, they seem noble but maybe a little piney thing there too, all on the swallow, and still well behind the contributions of the grain and the yeast, even the water chemistry. i think the grain fits for the style but also brings something a little unique, call it terroir, to this, and they were smart to not dry hop over it or anything. i like how dry this is too, and even though it might feel just a touch watery, there is a lot to like about the texture too. nice four season pils here, just unique enough, infinitely drinkable.",3.91
Blue Hen Pilsner,"I just wanted to preface by saying this was on sale, maybe closeout? I didn't want to charm it by looking at the age, so I'm not sure about that. In any event, this is pretty good, not sure why it's received so many mediocre reviews. I just finished the work week, prepping some dinner stuff and this is good. First sip really reminded me of the opening of JA's Sunny Ridge (which is literally perfect). It sort of plays simpler from there, there's a noble hop bite, a good malt body. It's hazy, not sure why? Maybe a really short lagering so it's not fined or perhaps it's just a zwickel in a sense. In any event, easy drinking, rounded, great option if you're a lager person. If you're into DFH and only really drink their hoppy offerings/stouts, maybe this won't resonate, and that's perfectly fine, just like the beer.

Give it a try. It's (surprisingly enough) a great beer.",4.15
Blue Hen Pilsner,"So I bought a twelve pack of this last week and put in the main fridge, not the beer fridge.

F: sharp and subtly prickly... delicate caress of plush curves midway; faint residual resinous dusting... back end is wonderfully, frictive, and crisp... ultra light on the palate

Notes via stream of consciousness: Blue Hen Pilsner... that name sounds familiar. There used to be a Blue Hen Beer Co. that contract brewed out of the Lion in Wilkes-Barre, PA but I'm not sure they ever made a Pilsner. That was way back. Well, good for Sam to take up the state bird again! It's poured a surprisingly hazy golden body beneath a short head of white foam. Why would they not filter this? I doubt it's dry hopped. Anyway, the head doesn't hold up that well but we'll see how the lacing turns out later. The aroma is clearly of rich, grainy Pilsner malt and grassy, spicy, herbal, and floral hops. The malt is lightly sweetish and there's a touch of an apple and citrus-like fruitiness to it. On to the taste... as you may have expected it tastes just like it smells but stronger and with an added bitterness. The malt is rich without being overdone, sweetish, grainy, and grassy. The hops are spicy, grassy, floral, and herbal. There's a delicate touch of lemon to it. The bitterness is median, and it finishes dry and hoppy. They've certainly nailed the Pilsner style here, and this is better than a lot of the Pilsners that I've had in Germany and the Czech Republic. This is, of course, a Czech style Pilsener but there are plenty of German breweries producing the style as well. In the mouth it's medium bodied on the lower side, and it's crisp with a fine-bubbled, standard carbonation. The drawbacks then? The slight haze, the lack of head retention, and what's turned out to be limited lacing as well. Otherwise this is a great Pilsner that I'd turn to all of the time if the price was right.

S - Smell is more appealing than the look. Grain scents. Light malt. Faint citrus. Cereal scents as well. Still very light scents overall though.

T - Taste follows scent. A little bitterness from citrus. Even a little floral. Very light grain malts. Not too complex. Those are the flavors. Actually. More lemon comes through as it warms up.

F - Some carbonation. Soapy consistency. Thin.

O - This is an okay beer. Not offensive, but doesn’t wow you. Perfectly fine for camping or drinking after working in the yard. I wouldn’t put this in my regular rotation though. It came in a variety pack with Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA, 90 Minute IPA, (and the Slightly Might which I haven’t tried.) 60 Min and 90 are great beers, and I’m not really a big IPA fan.

Well, it's clearly past December, but this one was given to me for free. It was supposed to be a variety pack exclusive, but it seems all the stores around me were breaking up the packs to make this one available in single cans. I think that's a good mood personally but I doubt DFH would be fans of a move like that

Pours a hazy pale yellow with a finger of white head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

There's still some bite in the nose despite the age, and it's quite nice. I'm picking up on aromas of lemon zest, grassy hops, toasted grain, crackery malt, white pepper, and a touch of honey

Taste wise it's a touch too sweet for me. I know that's basically the distinction in this style of Pilsner, but I think this one overdoes it just a tad, even if only up front. On the front end of the sip I'm tasting honey, bready malt, grassy hops, and light diacetyl. The swallow brings notes of lemon zest, pear skin, crackery malt, herbal hops, toasted grain, pepper and light honey

A light medium body pairs with gentle carbonation, resulting in a crisp and biting beer. Finishes mostly dry with a decent balance

Double Milk Stout,"I am a brewer and have been for 25+ years now. An important note;
Karl Strauss was my friend and he taught me how to critique a unique brew.
I am not easily impressed, I would like to say that Coffee and Milk Stouts are my personal loves in small batch brews.
Mr Strauss recommended one of my milk stouts to the LA Octoberfest an number of years ago. I would very much like to meet and shake the brewer or brewers hands who created this wonderful dark liquid concoction. The color is deep, the bouquet is amazing, mouth is a tiny bit light for me but very quick to finish and the flavors of the double milks are superb.

Double Milk Stout,"Smooth, silky and dangerously drinkable, Left Hand Brewing slides its double-digit alcohol percentage nicely behind the malts, milk sugars and gentle roast to tease their beer drinking audiences with a taste that's chocolate milk for adults.

Generally black and layering patiently into the glass, Double Milk Stout releases a classic dense froth of slightly tanned hues. Holding firm throughout the session, the bubbles host a scent that's creamy, roasty, chocolaty and vanilla-like. Similar in its early sweetness, the taste is soothingly sweet and malted with chocolate, toffee, caramel, honey and a general nougat character.

As the sweetness slowly retreats, its roasted elements increase to form an impression of smooth espresso roast, burnt toast, roasted nuttiness and a turn from milk chocolate to something more of the bittersweet variety. Soft and woodsy bitterness decorates the late palate and hits that notion of dark roast coffee home.

Smooth, creamy and warming heading into finish, a late spice of broad and woodsy bitterness offers a taste of char with kahlua spice, warm cream and a long linger of sweet, chocolate-like roast for a savory, velvety session meant sipping but you've got to watch yourself. This beer is super drinkable.",4.04

Aroma: There is a light aroma of malt and a slightly stronger scent of alcohol.

Taste: Up front it tastes like alcohol, burnt caramel, raisins, and brown sugar. The middle of the palate is full of dark fruit characters like raisins, plums, and dates. All of these comingle with a light toasted flavor and a touch of brown sugar character. It tastes a bit like a Belgian Strong Dark Ale but without some of the sweeter notes, and a slightly more toastier character.

Mouthfeel: It is medium-full bodied and slick. It is a sipper given the obvious presence of alcohol.

Overall: The label states that this contains ""Ingredients: Rocky Mountain water, malted barley, lactose, dextrose, flaked oats, hops, yeast."" It also states that this is ""10.5% ALC/VOL."" It is a simple beer with a lot of complex flavors, however it also shows the high alcohol content. As a whole the interesting flavors and the complexity make it worth recommending at least a sample or a single bottle, but I wouldn't recommend more than that until you've made up your mind. I probably wouldn't buy it again but it was worth trying out.",3.36
Double Milk Stout,"From the 12 oz bottle in a snifter. This solid little brew pours a dark
brownish black with a very nice head of kahki foam that settles to a
fat ring, thin dusty layer, and sports some nice lacing. Nose of dark
sweet chocolate, rich cream, brulee, char, and some subtle dark fruit
notes. Flavors surpass the nose with rich dark chocolate, rich cream,
dark coffee touches, roasted nutty malt notes, moderate char, deep
roast, dark molasses, and dark berry hints of blue and blackberry.
Nice mouth feel; full body, smooth, moderately slick, coating, rich,
moderately warming, and finishing nicely sweet and well balanced
for a desert brew.

Overall, a solid little brew.

Double Milk Stout,Not bad-tasting. But -- for what's essentially an imperial stout -- it's sugary and bubbly. I'd acquired a single bottle at Woodman's and deigned to pour out half.,3.47
Double Milk Stout,"Best by 8/16/22. 12oz bottle poured into a tulip.

Pours almost black; small light khaki head that fades quickly leaving little retention and lacing.

The aromas are malt forward. Hints of cocoa and marshmallow. Malts are there. They open up slightly as it warms.

The flavors are on the sweeter side. Lots of milk and milk sugars. Lots of marshmallow. Some vanilla. Lots of heavy cream. Some cocoa and milk chocolate. Strong malt backbone. Mild warmth in the finish, but the alcohol is ultimately well hidden at 10.5% ABV.

Mouthfeel is full-bodied with active carbonation. It's sharp, spritzy and slightly fluffy.

This is an alright brew. There's something about it that I'm not personally crazy about and I can't quite put my finger on what it is. It's still not bad at all though.",3.4

Double Milk Stout,"Bottle poured into a Mountain Rambler Brewery snifter

A: Pours dark brown, basically black, with a creamy tan head that settles to a thin layer and laces very nicely.

T: Milk chocolate, vanilla, big dark sugar, a little coffee, earthy roasted malt, a touch of spice, and a hint of dark fruit.

M: Medium to full body, moderate carbonation, creamy smooth, with the faintest warmth.

O: Pretty much exactly what you'd expect from an imperialized version of the venerable Left Hand Milk Stout. Sure it's on the sweet side and not overly complex, but it's impressively smooth and rather enjoyable, though most days I'd probably rather have 2 pints of the original instead.",4.04

Double Milk Stout,"Poured from a bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a super dark brown, nearly black color with a small head of tan colored foam. The head fades almost instantly, leaving a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big and inviting, with lots of milk chocolate, crème, and coffee like aromas. At the same time there is a nice dark roasted malt smell as well as sweet vanilla and caramel smells. Aromas of a warm boozy smell mix in, along with a bit of brown sugar, char, and raisin, giving rise to an overall sweet and warming smell.
Taste – The taste begins with a rather sweet milk chocolate latte flavor that has a strong backing of brown sugar and cola, with some light fruit sweetness of cherry and raisin. Upfront there is also a bit of char and roasted malt, but these are rather subdued in light of the heavy sweeter flavors. As the taste moves forward however, the roast and char become a bit more pronounced, while the milk chocolate fades a bit. At the same time the sweeter cola flavor gets more pronounced, and with a bit of a boozy rum like taste, and a surge of a vanilla marshmallow like flavor, one is left with a warming and sweet taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is on the thicker and heavier side with a carbonation level that is on the low side. For the rich flavors and style the feel is good and makes for a dessert like sipper.
Overall – A rather potent and sweet stout. A little unbalanced on sweet:roastiness ratio, but overall not bad and one to at least give a try to.",3.76
Double Milk Stout,"This is a strong double stout, clocking in with a double-digit ABV, but the good news is you won't get overwhelmed by the boozy flavor. You can actually taste the notes of brown sugar and vanilla as the label promises. It's not quite in Avery territory as far as ""knock you on your arse"", so you can drink a bottle of this and not feel hung over. This was part of their Milk Box sampler 12-pack, which features four different versions of their famous Milk Stout.",4.03

S- nose is a bit muted at first but eventually opens up with some caramel, dry leaves, toasted bread crust and a hint of floral hops

T- sweet and malty up front with notes of caramel and toasted brown bread. Mid-palate gives some floral hops before finishing with a hit of sweet caramel that lingers long after

Oktoberfest,"Appearance: Pours a clear, dark amber, almost copper color with a moderate off-white head. SRM of 14-15. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of brown bread malt, rich caramel, some scotch and booze with darker fruit mixed within. Rich and boozy.

Flavor: Moderate flavors of brown bread malt, rich caramel, booze, scotch, and some dark sweet fruit undertones. A sweet, boozy finish.

Feel: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation, somewhat appreciable. Soft, but boozy-like flavor lingers.

It's too boozy, not unlike Bitburger's Festbier without the authentic German flavors.

Overall: A decent Oktoberfest here. Brown bread and caramel malts mixed with scotch and booze. Sort of reminds me of a light Dirty Bastard from Founders. Enjoyable and flavorful, but I think it sort of misses the style a bit. (Rating: 3.63)",3.63
Oktoberfest,"Attractive appearance (as I believe most O'Fests are). Clear deep amber, bordering on copper, with a large off white head and a fair amount of lacing. Aroma dials up a solid, if unspectacular, rendering of a marzen: malt focused, lightly hopped, crusty bread. Taste also hits all the right notes with toffee, dark bread, and herbal hops all contributing. Modest bitterness as the hops become more assertive. Smooth, medium bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel.",3.94
Oktoberfest,"Oktoberfest (2021) from Brooklyn Brewery. Picked up at Shangy’s, Emmaus, PA. $ 2.11 (Including tax)/12 oz bottle ($ 0.176/oz) on 18/09/21. On room temperature shelf at store, stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 25/06/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Smeared dating in yellow ink on shoulder of bottle. Served at 40.1 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 48.0 degrees.
Appearance – 3.5.
First pour – Deep Gold (SRM 6), clear.
Body – Medium Amber (SRM 12), translucent. When rear-lite, clear with moderate effervescence.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), antique white, high-density, short retention, diminishing to a 0.2 cm bubble ring and a large thin island.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 3 – Weak malt. No hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 3.5 – Begins slightly sweet with malt. Hops add a refreshing bite. No ethanol (5.5 % ABV, as marked on label) aroma or taste. No gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3 – Thin, watery, lightly fizzy carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 3.5 Actually a tasty Marzen, one that could easily be consumed all day. The hops mediate the malt sweetness and leave a refreshing twist on what would be otherwise a chore to drink more than one.",3.33

Biscuity and malty. Toasted malts, nutty. Light toffee. Has an odd spice or flavor to it that I can’t pinpoint. Maybe like a dried apple or pear note.

Oktoberfest,"Pours an amber with off white head. Some caramel and toast on the nose. Maybe a little bit of a fruity note. Getting a lot of bread crust, lots of caramel. This isn't what I want from a Märzen as it doesn't really get into that malty nutty character I enjoy, but it isn't bad to drink by any means. There is enough hop character to keep this from getting cloyingly sweet.",3.61
Oktoberfest,"Pours from the bottle a dark amber, thin ring of head. Nose is well developed darker malts, toffee, burnt sugar. Starts slow on the palate with slight malty sweetness, but develops with some tannic elements, almost like a dark tea. Mouthfeel is full, slight carbonation.",3.13
Oktoberfest,"12 ounce bottle poured into a tumbler style pint glass.

Clear and copper with one finger of khaki foam that fades to a ring inside of a minute but leaves a small amount of lace. The nose starts full and malty, bread and toast, but changes to an overpowering iron mineral aroma. Taste is better, starting bready, with a hint of malty sweetness and finishing with an herbal/floral bitterness. It is light, refreshing and crisp, easy drinking but lacks creaminess . OK, the mineral aroma is a distraction.",3.36
Oktoberfest,"Ive probably had this beer 100 times and never reviewed it. so here we go.
Pouring at cellar temp into my .5L dimple mug. the beer pours a crystal clear chestnut hue. A fluffy eggshell white head of 1.5 cm foams up and rests lightly on the surface. This foam fades to a wispy surface layer and leaves some dense lattice when I swirl the mug or take a sip.
The aroma is rich toasted malt and light caramel with a bit of breadyness to it. Seems a little sweet on the nose but does have a bit of spicy hop scent too.
First sip reveals a light crisp textured body that is very easy to drink and i find my glass getting empty fairly quickly.
Medium carbonation that gently rolls across my palate only adds to the easy drinking here.
Flavor is caramel and bready malts, with some light toasted grains too. I do get a little spicy hop on the finish to balance the malt sweetness. Beer finishes with a little dryness. Very easy drinking brew with nice malt character. COuld easily drink several of these in a session.",3.95

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"12 oz. bottle, looks like it was bottled May 18, 2022, expiration August 18, 2023. My first beer from this brewery, and my first beer listed under the style of Festbier, which according to BeerAdvocate is the modern day equivalent to an Oktoberfestbier, so that's what I'm expecting.

Poured into Brasserie D'achouffe stemware.

A - Pours a coppery amber orange body, some ok clarity, and little over a finger's worth of frothy khaki head. Looks pretty good.

S - Nose brings in some crisp bready malts, with slight notes of mineral water & coppery metallics. Soft notes of cream, earth, green apple come through. Pervasive mineraly well water type aroma throughout. A little dusty.

T - Taste brings the same; some crusty bread malts, green apple, herbal earth, mineral water. Notes of cream & green apple linger on the finish. The bottle does say this was brewed with hop extracts in addition to actual hops, but any fresh or piney, or i guess ""American"" hop flavors are absent. Typical taste per the style I'd say.

M - Feel is smooth, medium-light in body, easy drinking. Apt carbonation. I just burped.

Overall, an easy drinking beer from this German brewery, I'd be interested in trying more from them, and also in trying more beers listed under the Festbier heading. A nice intro the this style.

Malty aroma with a touch of old bread.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"From the bottle, it pours a clear amber color with a nice white head that slowly reduces as it is being replenished by a nice stream of bubbles from the bottom and leaves lacing. The nose gets as dose of light malt. The mouth gets the same, an easy drinking malty brew.",3.71
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Simply speaking this is a very nice Festbier, and in such it’s a nice alternative to endless Märzen that are presented to us as Oktoberfestbeer. In recent years (meaning: decades), beer style at the actual Oktoberfest, at other fall beerfests such as Stuttgarter Wasen etc. have shifted from the heavy, dark and sweet Märzen towards the more easily drinkable Festbier style. In Germany at most of these events, Festbier is what everyone drinks. Märzen has become a niche in that regard. My personal preference is (by far) the Festbier style, and not the Märzen.
If you want to compare to understand what that difference actually is, get a sixer of Paulaner Oktoberfest Beer and a sixer of Oktoberfest Märzen. Both good, I just happen to line the non-Märzen better. Allgäuer Büble Festbier is a very nice example of this style.",3.99
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,A nice amber color that seems to be hazy like an IPA but without the bite back of a hoppy bier. It keeps a foamy head and has a smooth taste. In keeping with fest style biers i recommend drinking a liter glass...or two!,4.14

$2.79 @ Foodery Beer, Phila., PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a clear deep amber body beneath a finger's width of off-white foam. The aroma is gently malty with bready notes and a touch of caramel backed by softly herbal hop notes. On to the taste... it's fuller than the aroma suggests but it basically follows suit. The malt is lightly sweet, grainy, bready, and softly caramelish and the hops are softly herbal and spicy. A moderate to median bitterness balances it and it finishes with just a dollop of sweetish malt lingering amidst spicy, grassy, and herbal hops that eventually fade to leave just bitterness behind. In the mouth it's medium bodied and smooth with a moderate, fine-bubbled carbonation. The lacing held up well and it's left some nice lacing with wide patches surrounded by smaller streaks and spots. It's readily accessible and highly quaffable because it straddles the fence between being delicate and being satiating.

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"A new one for me. Have had other Allgäuer beers before, but the Büble Fest is a new one.

12 ounce import -- interesting. Packaged 02.06.21, Expires 02.09.22. Poured into my tall Becher.

L -- Clear, deep brassy gold with a dense, firm white head that leaves good lacing.

S -- Mellow herbal hops with light DMS and a bready malt backbone -- even some melanoidin showing.

T -- Good blend of herbal hops and bready melanoidin with the first swallow. There's a dry yeasty character very reminiscent of Paulaner Amber Märzen. Finish is spicy bitterness and nice melanoidin character in the aftertaste. The hop bitterness is bolder than the malts, but it still invites another gulp. There's also an underlying white grape note, common in German beers using good malts and a good mash.

M -- Mouthfeel is soft to slightly syrupy with a crisp, dry finish. Body is light-medium to medium.

O -- A little different take on Festbier with its hop note being a bit more prominent than usual -- maybe a bit too hop-heavy for my tastes in Festbier, but it's a great drinker and doesn't stunt the palate. A Fest/Märzen hybrid with its color and body. Worth a try for its good malt character.",4.27

Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"Poured from the bottle into a Libbey style pilsner glass.

Beautiful looking lager, with a brass gold and chestnut hued clarity for the body appearance, maybe even a faint touch of red squeaking out in the darker areas. Capped with a great looking cream top, nice white not yellowed and not bright bleach like either. This 2 finger top sits nicely with slow settling and some good spider legs of lacing too.

Aroma seems different. A very noticeable ester of banana getting into more of a hefe clove quality. Clean, with light touches of crisp toffee also. The banana seems misplaced but not in a bad way at least.

Palate continues more of this banana flavor but still provides fest character. Clean mid palate, quite fruity actually somewhat with a toffee mix and almost banana and berry sweetness. Mild sensing hop, a bit of hinting pasty sticky lager flavor just by a hair in the finish. Mild sense of spicy herbal classic hop in the mix.

Aroma of caramel malt with a little biscuit, sweet bread and a little grassy malt, similar to a Märzen. Flavor is caramel biscuit malt with some graininess, wheat bread and grassy hops. Slightly astringent, but moderate bitterness in the finish. Medium bodied with light creaminess. I guess these Festbiers are a mellowed out Märzen style. This one smelled like the latter to me. The flavor has less of the sweet caramel and more grainy biscuit. Grassy continental hops are traditional. The finish on this was a little too grainy and starkly grassy bitter. A satisfactory Octoberfest style lager, but I think I prefer the old fashioned Märzen better.",3.81
Allgäuer Büble Bier Festbier,"I've had only two beers from AllGauer and the first was its O-Fest. Having covered them for one season, I prefer its Festbier... in part because this only my 3rd in the style. (Indicating I'm, like, back in the 20th Century.)

This Festbier is good for malt-heads like me. Pretty in my tall weizen glass, this golden brew stays bubbly and creates a nice lace all the way down. Smells are average, almost entirely malt. (At least gimme a grassy hop.) Tastes are the same, but it never gets sweet. Balanced. Soft in my mouth, somewhat like wheat.

Fancying myself as a traditional drinker, I want to like Allgauer. But they may be too traditional even for me to warmup to. I went on their website for a second time (two years later than reviewing their O-fest) and for a second time I could not find the English button. Their product is good enough to be exported, but the language flexibility needs to be improved.",3.63
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","12 oz. can, best by date of 12/16/22. My first new beer from BrewDog in quite a while. Brewed by BrewDog in Winchester, Ohio. Acquired this can of Lord of the Rings beer as part of a mixed six pack at the local Binny's.

Poured to a La Fin Du Monde tulip.

A - Pours a pale juicy yellow-orange body, About a finger of bubbly soapy white head that dies out quick. Leaves behind a beer that is flat in appearance.

S - A nice soft aroma, more biscuity than anything I'd say. Hop content is there, but not juicy or bursting. Earthy, twiggy, leafy, skunky. Smells like fresh, but indistinct dry-hopping.

T - Taste is pretty light for the style, but right for the abv I suppose. Again, earthy leafty dry-hopping lends a bit of a skunky sort of hop flavor. Not particularly piney, resinous, or bitter. A bit of a peppery, rye malt flavor lingers near the finish.

M - Feel is smooth, crisp, clean, light-bodied, & easy drinking stuff. The 5.0% abv is nice.

Overall, an easy-drinking and inoffensive beer, but short on hop character if you ask me, especially if you're gonna call your beer a New England style IPA. Not entirely sure what this beer has got to do with Lord of the Rings, or if this beer would appeal to fans of the books / movies / series. A strange brew all around.

BrewDog Fellowship IPA (The Lord Of The Rings) -----3.5/5",3.55
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","This is another hazy IPA. It’s a pale yellow color with a thin head and considerable cloudiness. The aroma has a little hops, some earthiness, and a little underlying malt. All in all, though, it is understated. Balanced in taste, and drinkable. This one is okay, but not outstanding.",3.66
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings",Straw in color. Little to no head. Nose is very citrusy. Taste is brilliant citrus with a spark of bubbles on the palate. Nice Hazy beer even though the ABV is low.,4.0
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","Teaming up with the HBO producers for Lord of the Rings, Brewdog meets the occasion with a fruitier, hazier and softer IPA that's simply fellowship waiting to happen.

Pale gold, hazy and floating a stark-white foam, Fellowship IPA makes sensory introductions with a citrusy, tropical and stone fruit perfume leading to a sweeter cereal-laden taste of honeysuckle, wafer and angel food cake.

Continued sweetness stretches across the middle palate with a firm and sweet breadiness and a smooth, nearly vanilla-like spice. As the hops rise to meet the occasion, a citrusy take on tangerine and pink grapefruit provide a racy balance while a sweeter and more succulent pineapple and passionfruit character adds support and complexity. Trending lightly spicy and herbal with hops, a late taste of fresh spruce, cedar and fresh cut herbs take on a slight hemp character nearing finish.

Lighter, crisper and refreshing, the beer is off-clean and citronella-like in a medium length finish and a gin-like aftertaste. Hints of peach and hemp lead the way in retrospect to an overall impression that's not pump or rounded enough to be hazy, but still not quite crisp or bitter enough to be traditional American IPA.",3.73
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","12 ounce can poured into a tulip glass. Enjoy by 12/16/22, so plenty fresh.

L---Lightly hazy, light, bright golden color. Medium white head faded quickly to a ring and left very nice lacing.

S---Tropical fruits. Strong pineapple, Mango & papaya.

T---Citrus adds to the tropical notes from the nose.

F---Light/medium bodied with good carbonation.

O---Good, not great.",3.93
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","Decent beer, though no point to go into the ratings as its a taste I haven't had dozens of times before from this company or many others. I often wonder if companies repackage these beers and simply release them under new names from time to time...",3.77
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","A very solid Hazy IPA. Not mind blowing, but good. Nice citrus aroma, with a smooth citrus taste. It was a little thin, with a finish that ends quickly. Overall I liked it and would drink it again.",4.23
"Fellowship IPA, The Lord of the Rings","A nice juicy session style hazy ipa. Gives the right lacing and mouthfeel to enjoy the experience. The juiciness isn't obnoxious though. It has a nice citrus, hop experience. The can is awesome, nice feel and look with the LOTR franchise collaboration.
I have a pic on my phone of the very cool can as well as my beer in a glass, but the limitations on size can't be met and transferring to the PC is more than I care to do.",4.06
"Duvel 6,66%","Picked up a four-pack from TW-Greenville, SC 7-27-22 for $16.99. Best by 08-2023; consumed 9-16-22.

Beer poured blond with a near perfect white head that has some great hang time.

Nose is pilsner malt forward and very yeasty.

Taste is a very light pilsner malt base which the yeast lends light pear and apple to. Finishes very balanced as the hopping is nicely handled.

Mouthfeel is perfect; very light and crushable but you want to relish each refreshing sip as it dances across my palate.

Overall a wonderful blonde, almost a Tripel lite!",4.2
"Duvel 6,66%",Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a tulip-like glass; best before 8/23 stamp. Pours golden yellow with plenty (2+ fingers) worth of foamy head that slowly recedes. Tastes of banana like esters (?) with good carbonation. Good.,3.96

S: musky, earthy highlights upon a spice, lemon meringue foundation... freshly-washed skin, wet cottony towel; urinal?... little potency or depth; all overtones

T: strange hoppy blend with an interesting flavor sequence/development... lemon-peppered, everything-seasoned cracker... grassy, yeasty middle... dandelion tea (flowers, roots) aftertaste... dry, water biscuit thing... 6 hops?! - now I'm curious... the orange addition expresses as a fragrant essence, but is it also contributing to the bitterness?... the bitterness is very Duvel: leafy, herbal, peppery, spicy

F: quintessential extra dryness for a Duvel... fleecy-soft texture, light, airy body

O: an interesting twist on Duvel... arguably a bit more color (flavor nuance) than the OG, but only marginally... can't say I'd crave another, but perhaps it pairs well with some buttery seafood? (1985)",4.01

"Duvel 6,66%","Brouwerij Duvel Moortgat NV ""Duvel 6.66""
11.2 fl. oz. brown glass bottle ""Best before end: 08 2023 L20708 1732""
$17.99/4-pk @ Wegmans, King of Prussia, PA

Notes via stream of consciousness: This is a lighter, and lower alcohol version of Duvel at 6.66% ABV as opposed to the usual 8.4%. It's also quite different. Right off the bat it's poured a hazy golden body as opposed to the usually perfect clarity when properly poured. The full and fluffy bright white head is the same, and be careful when pouring or it might try to rise up out of the glass! The head is made up of many very small bubbles giving it an airy and pillowy appearance.
It looks like a warm marshmallow that's just about to melt. The head retention and lacing are both quite good (I've already sampled three out of the four I bought). The aroma is bright with flowers, soft fruit (apples, orange, hint of lemon, background banana), candy sugar, sweet malt, delicate crushed black peppercorn, and a touch of spice. The flavor follows, and it's surprisingly rich. It's sweet and sugary but also floral, peppery, gently spicy, malty and subtly woody and earthy. A firm bitterness breaks through mid-palate and it starts to dry, eventually finishing with some earthiness and lightly spicy hop flavors. It lingers with some residual malt, crushed black peppercorn, earthiness, and those delicately spicy hop notes. It's impressively balanced with a fresh hop presence and bitterness that dances amongst sweet and sugary malt character. This isn't necessarily more hoppy than the original Duvel but the additional citrusy and floral character gives it a greater depth of character. Missing is the very well hidden snap of alcohol of the original Devil but the hops make up for it. In the mouth it's medium bodied with a gentle caress on the tongue that can sometimes be a little bit more bristling although it always softens to become quite smooth and airy. This version has less bite than the original, and yet I'm not really sure that it's really that much more drinkable - hence the original name, Duvel! It is remarkably enjoyable, however, and even more drinakble in terms of alcohol.
Review #8,193",4.28
"Duvel 6,66%","special version of this, a little lower alcohol but quite a bit more character than the single version, its hoppy in a delicate but distinctive way, has a beautiful ferment on it, and is still similar to the original from a yeast standpoint, really high quality and gorgeously refined belgian blonde here, shocked it does not have higher ratings, what more do people want from this style? golden straw colored and not quite clear from the little stubby bottle, high rising white head with great retention and undeniable effervescence. it smells rather complex, but also extremely cohesive, noble hop spiciness through a good portion of it, unique yeast esters from ripe banana to lemongrass, black and green peppercorn, and even rubbed sage or something truly herbal. there is a lightness and a brightness to this, a simple belgian pils type malt base, and really excited carbonation, seems super dialed in to me. the flavor is great, yeast forward, classically belgian, light pear and gum esters, cool spiciness super compatible with the hops, clean citrus, but the flavor is tied up intimately with the texture, and this fizzes and pops like no other before a rapid dry finish, its so refreshing and vibrant, tidy for a belgian without a long linger, and the higher hop content bringing some late bitterness to help snap it up further. lightly floral late, warms up peachy and clovey, but to me stays delicate and easy, very jovial and springy, and the hops do a lot for this. overall super impressive beer, again i am surprised to see it scored this low here on BA, its a winner. neat to see some innovation from duvel! i could drink a dozen of these.",4.2
"Duvel 6,66%","Poured into a Duvel tulip glass. Looks a lot like classic Duvel, including the massive head, with a couple of differences. The color is a bit lighter here compared to the classic, and the head is slightly less dense, but still stays around for a while.

Smell is classic Belgian, malty and yeasty up front, with a healthy mix of fruit, I am picking up mainly apple and pear and a hint of lemon.

Was not near as hop heavy as expected. Fruit really dominates for me, mainly pear and apple. There is a decent amount of peppery heat at the finish, leaving me with a slight burning sensation. Actually a pretty nice blending of flavors.

Feels nice and solid to me, quite a bit of carbonation. Really makes my tongue tingle.

A different but very nice variation on a classic. My main complaint with classic Duvel is it leans a bit heavy on the hops, this version feels more like some classic Belgian ales. This one really screams summer beer to me, drinking it on a 90 degree day, and really hits the spot. Highly recommended, really can't go wrong with it.",4.18
"Duvel 6,66%","Poured from 330mL bottle into my BeerAdvocate teku. Best by 8/2023.

Appearance: nice medium-golden hue with a moderate haze and a huge, pretty, and inconvenient head of about 3 thick fingers of frothy ivory foam. Lovely!

Smell: light, sweet malt, with a lovely apple-pear orchard-like aroma, topped with a light but notable dose of noble hops. Again -- lovely!

Taste: sweetly malty, with a share of that lovely pear character from the aroma. There's something here, whether it's the light booziness or the clash of the hops and the peary malt character, that makes it not quite as good as its aroma. Still, it's delicious -- just not quite as delicious as I want it to be.

"Duvel 6,66%","A: Pours a clear medium yellow in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising/streaming quickly from the bottom of the glass and moderate pale golden yellow + bright yellow colored highlights. The beer has a four finger tall dense fizzy sudsy foamy bright white head that slowly reduces to a large patch of thick film covering a little more than 80% of the surface of the beer surrounded by a large patch of medium thick film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Light to moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Slightly stronger than moderate aromas of spicy Belgian yeast (white pepper + coriander) over the top of moderate aromas of pale + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of light fruit (pear + white grape) sweetness. Light aromas of floral + herbal + grassy + citrus/lemon hops.

T: Upfront there are moderate flavors of pale + wheat malts with a light to moderate amount of light fruit (pear + white grape) sweetness. That is followed by slightly stronger than moderate flavors of spicy Belgian yeast (white pepper + coriander). Finally there are light flavors of floral + herbal + grassy + citrus/lemon hops which impart a light amount of bitterness which slowly fades away leaving lingering floral + yeasty flavors.

Mouthfeel is light and a bit dry. The aftertaste is fairly sweet. Overall, this is a fantastic beer!",4.24
"Duvel 6,66%","A large number of hop varietals without being too hoppy. Is that a good definition of balance?
Poured into my Duvel 150th Anniversary commemorative glass, 6.66 ABV Looks quite inviting: rocky head, mostly clear body until the last pour. Blondie Smells more modest, 6.66 could fling off more fruit. Tastes are balanced; much like its higher ABV parent, yeast and spices and malts all play nice. Cleansing and quite full in my mouth... which is masterful at 6.66 ABV.

This will be a better table ale than I expected, particularly for summer fare. Glad I bought a 4-pack.... and may want another.
Duvel is also my most favored brand manager among crafters. Duvel lets its brands loose to create... but it does that because Duvel knows itself how freedom, properly directed, can create.

6/21/22 On the summer Solstice when light is most prevalent, I am glad to report that 6.66 plays pretty darn nice with Bob's World-Famous Ratatouille. This complement is usually won by saisons, but 6.66 is a true premium Blonde. I'm keeping count over at UnTappd.",4.0

"Duvel 6,66%","The beer of the devil is now available on the shelves for us all to enjoy. Spicier, drier and fruitier, this beer makes one hell of a debut.

Light chrome, racing with carbonated streams and building a fluffy white crown, Duvel 6.66 teases the nose with a sharp and spicy scent of citrus zest, dried fruit, vinous spice, grassy and botanical perfumes. A low lying sweetness grazes the early palate with the lightness of wafer crackers, light bread and a hint of fresh dough.

As the flavors unfold on the middle palate, the malts retreat and the fruits begin to shine. Pear, apple and lemon all seem branch-dried in nature while the more spicy flavors of orange, lemon, grapefruit and lime zest play out partly fruity but partly spice. Those spices lean into the briskness of coriander, white pepper and vinous tanginess precisely. A late taste of bitterness is herbal, pleasantly grassy and herbal with lemon balm and sassafras.

Light, crisp and highly refreshing, the beer is plagued slightly bite the fruit tannins that amplify the hop bitterness and give the beer a decidedly bitter balance in finish and aftertaste. A quick fleeting malt presence leaves behind a long and spicy aftertaste.",4.09

Caramel, dill pickle, oak & bourbon heat notes in the nose.

Thick, sticky mouthfeel.

Smoked caramel & dill pickle flavors up front; oak, bourbon & fig notes on the finish.

Dead 'N' Dead,"Appearance - Pours a deep amber with two fingers of off-white head.

Smell - earthy and spicy hops, whiskey, cherry, some char aromas from the barrel, caramel, biscuity and toasted malts, and earthy yeast.

Taste - earthy and spicy hops upfront then quickly goes into the whiskey and char. The cherry is subtle but comes through next alongsdide the caramel. The biscuity and toasted malts accompanied by the earthy yeast rounds out the brew.

Mouthfeel - Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation. Finishes sticky from the malts alongside a pleasant alcohol warmth from the whiskey.

Overall - An interesting brew that is not for the faint of heart. This one is meant for those who like whiskey forward brews. They definitely did a good job on that. The ABV is pretty hidden in this one making it a dangerous sipper. A pleasant tipple on this fall-ish evening here in Cowtown.",4.19

Taste: Hot and boozy, with the oak barrel, and whiskey tones dominant throughout the whole sip. I did pick up some hints of plum and cinnamon, almost like a fruit cake. Toffee sweetness was noticable mid sip to the end. This would likely go great with Christmas dessert around a fire.

Dead 'N' Dead,"Tallboy can from the LCBO; dated Jul 28 2021 and served barely chilled. Always nice to see a new Rogue beer, as their presence around here has been spotty in the recent past.

Pours a foggy orange-amber colour, crowned with nearly an inch of smooth, creamy, off white-tinged head that gradually seeps off. Within five minutes, it has been reduced to a thick, creamy collar and filmy cap, with a gorgeous curtain of lace left clinging to the glass - a beautiful glass of beer. Plenty of bready malt and toasted grains on the nose, with vanilla and toffee also coming through pretty clearly; also some subtler hints of oak, plum, apple and booze.

It's a fine strong ale, boasting a firm oak-iness on the back end. It starts off with bready malts, toasted grains and toffee sweetness, with hints of whiskey and vanilla developing quickly. Suggestions of herbal hops, spiced & stewed plums, apple and a touch of raisin are quickly overtaken by oak chip/'wood tannins', which linger through the finish and into a moderately warming aftertaste of whiskey and malts. Medium-full in body, with middling carbonation that gives a gentle bite to this bock's smooth, satisfying texture. Fair drinkability - I was getting a little tired of the oak chips by the end of the glass, but finishing the can was no challenge at all.

Final Grade: 4.04, an A-. Much like its older, lighter brother, Dead 'N' Dead bears only a passing resemblance to the style Rogue has chosen to market it as - though I suppose in this case, the whiskey/oak chip treatments made that practically inevitable. If taken strictly as a German maibock (I'm not), there is ample opportunity for criticism - but as a strong oaked beer, I think it's quite enjoyable. In truth, I'd probably take regular Dead Guy over this... but then again, I've never been gung-ho about either oak or whiskey, so folks who happen to be really big on strong oaked ales might enjoy it even more than I did. Either way, give it a try it you have the chance.",4.04
Dead 'N' Dead,"Hazy, deep amber body, building a sandy bubbly head that crumbles down within a minute.
Sweet malty aroma of caramel apple, faintly of warm spice and vanilla, dash of maple syrup; pretty mild.
The taste follows suit on malt side of things - caramel notes, warm, a touch of toffee - and finds that well balanced by prominent, and clean, bittering hops. There's also whispers of oak, and the alcohol is noticeable to a small degree. Fine, medium carbonation, medium body, all in all a pleasant feel.

sweet honey malts. Flavors follow the nose with pine and herbal
hop notes awash in light bourbon that is pretty hot, subtle raw
oak, and notes of honey and caramel malts with touches of
vanilla. Excellent mouth feel; medium body, smooth, lightly crisp,
medium light carbonation that is brisk, and a herbal and pine hop

Pretty light bodied for a brew of the abv. Gets thin at times.

So, this was aged for me...I didn't ask for that. I would have preferred finding it fresh and then making my own decision whether to cellar it or not.
As is, it's not too shabby.",3.86
Dead 'N' Dead,"2018 vintage

Being a massive fan of OG Dead Guy, I knew I had to get this when I saw it. Hopefully this expands upon what I love about the original

Pours a turbid, hazy copper with just a cap of off white head that fades quickly to a ring and leaves no lacing

The nose is quite sweet, but almost artificially so. I get layers of vanilla, honey, and caramel with very mild pepper to back it up. The barrel doesn’t really do much aroma wise other than contributing the vanilla notes

The taste is more of the same, yet not as exciting. To start things off, I get caramel and a light whiskey tingle. On the aftertaste, this translates to a decent oaky sweet bourbon with hints of honey and a touch of chocolate

This has a medium body and almost no carbonation, yet it still drinks pretty light, especially for the abv. This is probably the biggest saving grace of this one

Well shit, here’s an instance where the base beer is better thab the barrel aged version!! It could be a freshness issue, as I noticed this was pretty much a malt bomb when compared to the delicate balance of the original. Regardless it was not a bad beer, but I know what I’ll be reaching for first",3.81
Dead 'N' Dead,"A special treat on the porch! Bourbon and honey malt aroma. The taste is full of rich, sweet raisins and honey and a lasting malt flavor. It leaves a nice tingle on the edges on the tongue and the classic, yet slight, bourbon burn on the way down.",3.83

Caramel malt aroma.

AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"12 oz can. Canned on 7/11/22
Pretty amber/gold in hue. Bountiful off-white head pushes 2 fingers with pretty solid retention.
Nose is instantly on the sweeter side. Fruit and caramel malt. Slowly a hint of breadiness comes in, but it's struggling to be noticed, chasing the spotlight but never getting a chance to shine.
Flavor is slightly closer to balanced. The caramel malts are not as dominant here, the bready note finally gets a moment, but just a moment. A mild herbal spice also takes its turn.
Mouthfeel has good carbonation, decent heft, and an almost balanced finish (a tad sweet still) with a tad of bitterness.
Overall, a decent offering but not outstanding.",3.46
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"This beer has a very nice crisp malty finish that makes it stand out.

Soft, medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation.

AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"This beer makes me think of the ""Chicken Dance"" and outdoor Octoberfest celebrations. Pours a rich caramel color with very active carbonation and a loose, thin head that leaves no lacing. Smell and flavor are both caramel, toffee, fresh warm wheat bread.

AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"12oz canned on 07/30/2021. Sample from the brewery.

Bright, clear, light amber in color with a thin foamy lace that quickly dissipates. Some toasty and caramelly malts in the nose. Medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and a bit flat on the palate. Malty, toasty, and bready with a dominate caramelly profile that's quite sweet. Hint of spice and faint bitterness, but the malty profile shuts that down. Finish is a bit dry with toasty bread crust.

Aleschmidt Oktoberfest is a pretty average, and somewhat one-dimensional, Märzen that doesn't look good in the glass.",3.02
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"From the can, it pours a clear amber color with a modest head that slowly diminishes, leaving some lacing. The nose gets a bit of malt. The mouth gets the same, decent oktoberfest with modest caramel, roasted malts and overall a pleasant taste.",3.94
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"Poured from fridge temp. Pours an absolutely gorgeous murky orange with white head. The nose on this is incredible. The crisp malts jump out immediately. Refreshing caramel follows. Figs, grapes, freshly-baked bread, and a bit of earthy grass. The taste is where this one really shines. A sweetness bites the tongue immediately. The depth of the malts really smacks the back of the mouth. Toffee, wheat, bread, raisins, prunes, wood, grass, and maybe a distant citrus peel bitterness on the back end. This one really hits all of the right boxes for a fantastic Märzen. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and, again, comes with a fantastic aftertaste. I would buy a bunch of this in a heartbeat. In fact, that's what I will do tomorrow! A great beer!",4.35
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"Poured from a can into a pint glass
Appearance – The beer pours a clear orange amber color with a small head of fizzy white foam. The head has a light level of retention, fading to leave a bit of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is strong of a toasted bready smell mixed with aromas of caramel. Along with these aromas are some light notes of harvest fruits of pear and apple as well as a touch of grain and herb.
Taste – The taste begins with a caramel and harvest fruit sweetness (apple, pear) along with a medium light toasted bready malt body. As the taste advances these flavors persist, while some light herbal and earthy tastes join in. The mix of flavors takes the taste to the end and leave one with a sweeter lightly toasted taste to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is average in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. For the sweeter malt flavors of the brew the feel is good and makes for a nice easy sipper.
Overall – A rather nice very easy drinking Oktoberfest.",3.84
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"It's smooth, very mildly sweet, crisp, refreshing. I tried it warm and cold since it is a German beer and cold is significantly better. There's no butter taste to this beer.",4.36
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"Poured from 12oz can into a mug. Canned 7/21/21.

Appearance: good golden-orange hue with a tiny touch of haze and a thin layer of fizzy white foam. The color is outstanding but the head dissipated too quickly.

Smell: richly malty with notes of dark bread and molasses. Perhaps a tad sweet, but still, very nice.

Taste: bready, a bit toasty, and a bit biscuity. There's a light but balanced bitterness; the overall effect seems very autumnal to me (as one might expect). I'm not usually a fan of the biscuity character in malt, but here it adds an appropriate dimension to a beer of this style.

Mouthfeel: medium body with a decent level of carbonation and creaminess.

Overall: a good example of the style, I think. Not sure what caused the head to die so quickly, but other than that, it's a good quaff.",3.95
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"From the bottom of the can: ""CANNED ON 07/30/21 5511""

Appearance: The body of the beer is a medium shade of copper towards the middle and a lighter shade of amber at the edge. It has moderate clarity with some light haze. It has a short white head that fades out to a medium white ring and a film on the surface.

Aroma: There are notes of cherry and a light oak character mixed with crushed acorn and walnut.

Taste: Cherry comes through with a light bit of caramel up front. In the middle there is a light roasted nut character with a hint of toasted bread. The back of the mouth has more of the same nuttiness that the middle does. Aftertaste has a light caramel sweetness.

Mouthfeel: It feels medium-light on the palate and watery. Very light toasted bitterness. It doesn't cling well to the palate or have much of an impact on it. It has a light bit of slickness which feels off for the style.

Overall: It feels like the average attempt at an Oktoberfestbier but it lacks texture, complexity, cohesiveness, and it doesn't look the greatest in a glass. It's drinkable and I probably wouldn't turn one down for free but it isn't something I'd likely buy again or recommend.",3.15

From: From: Trader Joe’s in College Area (San Diego), Calif.
Purchased: Sept. 25, 2020
Consumed: Oct. 1, 2020
Misc.: Canned on Sept. 3, 2020

Grabbed a can of this, a bunch of other stuff and a 6-pack of something else on a recent trip to Trader Joe’s. AleSmith does almost everything well (except hoppy beers to me, but everything else), so I was looking to try this. Was actually surprised that I hadn’t reviewed this before, let alone checked into it on Beer Advocate. Back of the can read, “This German-style Marzen Lager is our take on a classic Oktoberfest offering. AleSchmidt Oktoberfest is characterized by a clean, elegant, and toasty malt character. Prost!”

Poured a dark amber clear color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki white rocky-to-frothy head, which dissipated quickly. Lots of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Bad watery, spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled Outback bread, honey, wheat, sweet grain, mixed nuts, toasted malts, chewy caramel, toasted biscuit and graham cracker. Not quite as good from the can but got some earthier malts with some leathery toffee notes. (Smell - 4.00)

Tasted a little better than the nose but followed for the most part. A very clean beer. Got Outback bread, honey, wheat, sweet grain, toasted malts, chewy caramel, mixed nuts, Wheat Thins, toasted biscuit, leathery toffee, hints of tobacco and graham cracker. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, toasty finish. (Feel - 4.25)

This was an excellent Oktoberfest beer, something I would expect from AleSmith. (Overall - 4.25)

AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"Lovely coppery amber color with a handsome pile of foam in the Leute Bokbier glass. Quite malty and fragrant with roasted grain. Odd gummy flavor that seems to be a feature of some of these Märzen style beers. Hint of apples, even candy apple as the malt is quite sweet.

Plenty of raw flavors and the grainy finish. I don't rate this with my favorite Oktoberfest favorites. There is a bitterish metallic aftertaste that I don't find very appealing. Still it's well made and quite quaffable. From the 12 oz can.",3.49
AleSchmidt Oktoberfest,"12 oz can poured into a pint glass. The AleSchmidt pours a clear copper with a thin cap of foam. Decent bubble formation from the bottom of the glass but retention is lighter than hoped for.

Nose is slightly malt forward for the color yet not so much as for most American versions of the style. I think festbier is quite different than Marzen in style. This one is squarely in the middle. Offering some complex malts but without the easy and quick blast of gringo marzen/oktoberfest beers with a 2row base and a sloppy caramel malt boost. And that I appreciate. Still I'm not picking up the pils/munich I seek either. Does offer a decent finish but the muddled malt notes trounce the cleaner malt and hop notes this dude seeks. Better than many. Go to Munich for festbier",3.56

KBS - Hazelnut,"Nearly black with a thin tan head. Fairly strong nutty aroma with chocolate & coffee. Mild initial sweetness gradually intensifies to strong sweetness. Excellent combination of flavors: hazelnut & chocolate up front with coffee, roasted malt , vanilla, bourbon, barrel flavors & a little hopiness. It was a little thinner than expected, plenty of carbonation & lots of stomach heat. Overall: delicious!",4.42
KBS - Hazelnut,"the hazelnut smells and tastes almost too bold to be natural, like if this is real hazelnuts, its a whole lot of them, and infused somehow other than just resting in an ambient temperature barrel, at least it seems that way to me, but that said, its also not out of balance, and the nut seems to ground and balance some of the natural sweetness, it also makes both the chocolate and coffee pop, especially the coffee, and even though this is a small doses thing because of how strong and strongly flavored it is, its also delicious. desserty without being diabetic. the nose on this black shiny beast is nut forward, light smoke and dark roast from the coffee, plenty of bitterness there, along with dark chocolate character playing in the same space and quite a lot of oak. the bourbon is there with a little sweetness and alcohol warmth, both of which are exacerbated as it sits and comes up to temperature, the whiskey profile really flatters both the hazelnut and the coffee, big irish coffee vibes here. vanilla notes in the flavor, lots of nuance to the nut, more of a milk chocolate vibe after a few sips, but in the end its the coffee that pushes through all the dark malts and other stuff to be the dominant flavor, i taste bitter not quite perfectly fresh dark roasty drip coffee on my palate longer than any other element. its smooth the whole way, never too alcoholic, and really quite decadent. i think the hazelnut might be slightly overdone here, but it definitely brings new proportions to this iconic base beer. i always get nervous when breweries play with their legendary recipes like this one, but so far these variants have been fun and well executed. i dont need this much added flavor, but its good. cool to find this on tap too!",4.25
KBS - Hazelnut,"Bottled on 1/26/2022. Poured out of a 12 oz. bottle into my snifter glass, this beer pours a very dark brown, almost black color with a dark tan head that's about an inch thick when first poured that settles to an extremely thick ring lining the inside of the glass at the beer's surface along with a thick layer of surface foam and some pretty good lacing. Aromas of roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and notes of hazelnut. Also an earthy and herbal hop note. The flavors are pretty much the same, with roasted malts, somewhat bitter espresso and somewhat sweet chocolate notes, toasted hazelnut, and an earthy and herbal hop note that rounds it all out. The hop flavor seems fairly dank, which I was not expecting, and it is a nice touch. The hazelnut note is also quite enjoyable and well integrated into this beer. The roast level on the malts is just a bit too intense for what I prefer, to the point where it comes across on my palate as being slightly too acrid. Actually, this note seems to get more intense as the beer warms up. Not a good thing, as it really overpowers the rest of the flavors in an unpleasant way. Are all the bottles of this batch like this, or did I just get a bad bottle? Has a crisp, smooth, slightly oily, slightly gritty, medium to full bodied mouthfeel that really coats the inside of my mouth.

S- fresh, herbal & earthy espresso up front with an equal part of bold hazelnut to match. The hazelnut and fresh coffee really compliment each other.

Smell is decadent. Nutty bittersweet chocolate, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate ice cream, Nutella on toast. Slight roasted flavor covered up again by nutty chocolate.

Taste: starts off with a bit of milk chocolate, accompanied by toastiness and a light nutty balancing note. Middle has a lot more of the hazelnut, roasted. Finishes with a hint of alcohol burn and a lingering burned sugar sweetness.

Atomic Torpedo,"Clear amber body; sparse carbonation yet thick, sticky, white head. Malty, spicy nose. Big malt backbone taste with a zesty, spicy hop presence; light alcohol note; earthy sweetness; moderate hop bitterness. Heavy body; mildly coarse on the palate; some alcohol heat.

This is another beer that is probably past its prime. It's not really juicy at this stage, but still is tasty enough and has some great eye appeal. It does ooze double IPA character.

Atomic Torpedo,"Amber pour with excellent clarity; off white head of mixed bubbles; very good cap retention; heavy ring; bands of soapy lace; no legs. Caramel malt and citrus nose; a whiff of pine as it warms. Semi sweet caramel malt base gives way to bitter citrus and orange marmalade; lemon on the backend. Sticky resin feel, medium light body; moderate carbonation; no warmth from 8.2%; no astringency. Overall a very well balanced WC DIPA with a light bitter citrus linger.",4.42
Atomic Torpedo,"568 ml can, from Vinmonopolet, Nettbutikken. ABV is 8.2%. Clear deep golden colour, large to moderate white head. Aroma of malts, grain and orange marmalade.

Atomic Torpedo,"Is it “Atomic?” Or at least a Torpedo? At it’s ripe old age, I’m not really thinking either. Let’s go with with “light mist” and “.22 caliber.” Like, both could still affect you in certain ways, but there are bigger and bladder things, you feel me? It’s fine and ok. And ok. And fine. But like a first kiss, Raul will not recall it down the line.",3.6
Atomic Torpedo,"Drank from the 19.2 oz can. Aroma is very fresh. Wheatgrass, apple, very light citrus, some pine.

Overall, this is a nice balanced drink that I could see myself coming back to.",4.0
Atomic Torpedo,"This is one that I got in a Sierra Nevada mixed box. What a great surprise. If you like the original Torpedo, you'll love the Atomic. Taste is similar to the Torpedo but this one is definitely amped up and I love it. I would truly recommend it to anyone. Enjoy.",4.21
Atomic Torpedo,"Can dated 4/14/22. Golden orange in color, slightly off white , 2 inch head with nice clinging lace. Not much smell.... light pine, dank, earthiness.

Atomic Torpedo,"Can. Tulip glass.
Standard golden-orange, 3/4 finger head, mild murkiness.
Citrus scent.
After the midstream of grapefruit malt,
the East juicy style slides in easy.
Citrus tang epilogue, a defiant note which hovers in sharp contrast to the North East blanket.

Goes well with Banana Bread. Listening to the Melvins.",3.99
Atomic Torpedo,"Pours a slightly cloudy, deep amber coloration with a large, fluffy head. Smells of doughy, caramel malt and resinous, citrus hops, with notes of grapefruit and pine, as well as hints of floral and woody accents. Taste is a great balance of doughy, caramel malt and fruity, resinous, herbal, slightly floral, spicy and woody hops, with citrus notes of grapefruit and lime peel, as well as some pine and hints of cedar wood and nutmeg. Finishes with a medium bitterness and some grapefruit, pine and nutmeg lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

While this may lack the punch and expressive character one might expect of a Double Ipa, it's quite easy drinking for the ABV without a hint of booze to it, while featuring quite an intriguing array of hop characteristics, ranging from fruity and floral over bitter and resinous to more subtle spicy and woody. While it's dominated by that typical West Coast character of citrus and resinous pine, there's a good, East Coast, caramel malt backbone to this as well, while those other accents make for a very interesting drinking experience here.",4.17
Liquid Hot Magma,"16oz can poured into a becher.

A: Deep golden color, almost approaching amber. uniform haze is barely opaque. Billowy white head retains extremely well. Very chunky lacing.

S: Bursting with passionfruit and mandarin orange, pineapple, guava, peach. Meyer lemon. Faint whiffs of green grass clippings. Simple grain base is doughy with a slight toasty grain character. It is so pronounced and tropical, it isn't even funny. This is one of the most memorable noses I've sniffed all year in the IPA world, and that says a LOT.

T: Orange juice, pineapple, hints of mango and peach. Squeeze of meyer lemon and some pithiness. Tart passion fruit for an instant. There's an almost creamy pina colada impression too. Some green oiliness and perhaps the faintest hint of sweet onion buried far in the background. Quick brush of alcohol. Doughy grain base, slight toastiness. Bitterness is fairly minimal. Peaches and cream sort of finish with some green-ness.

M: Medium-full body. Even creamy and full/fluffy feel from stem to stern. Cloud-like. Well carbonated and airy, without being sharp. There's plenty of lift, but the easy and creamy texture is never broke. Very slight hop tannin grip.

O: In a sea of hazy IPAs, this is a true standout. Get it in a blind tasting with all the hype-bombs and watch it mop the floor with the field. It's so well-focused, with a simple and straightforward grain bill that adds awesome texture and backbone, and the hopping is truly unique. Ridiculously fresh and tropical to the point you could swear it was made with actual fruit. There's no hop burn, no muddiness, and it drinks so easily and sits lightly in the stomach. This is hazy IPA at its absolute pinnacle.",4.61
Liquid Hot Magma,"Here's another one. A pseudo IPA likely without much of an essential ingredient, barley malt. How can you tell? First, it's the big foamy mess on top of the liquid contents emptied from a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. The ridiculous mess recedes quickly, unevenly, unattractively and with slight lacing. Usually, this also means a brew lacking body and complexity, but we shall taste. The aroma is weak, with just a little wet hoppiness present. It rises above a dirty amber colored beer. To drink, the body is way too light for something in this category. But, there is enough depth to the sweet background to compliment a nice hop presence that seems more earthy than the self described fruit references. The ABV is included only as a positive taste inclusion.This is one more example of a not so bad IPA that would only be improved with more barley malt.",4.03
Liquid Hot Magma,"Man, I love Zero Gravity, one of the best New England breweries and one that delivers consistently tasty IPAs, pale ales, and lagers at a lower than usual price. I have the mix pack in my fridge right now. This new one pours almost a glowing orange, hazy but not thick. Smells a bit earthy and slightly fruity. Taste is pungent hops, bringing some sharp oniony grass but also some citrus fruit as well. Easy to drink for 8%.",4.29
Liquid Hot Magma,Really enjoyed this one. Tasted pretty green to me. From what I remember it's close to Other Half's All Green Everything. Aroma and flavors are both complex and keep the beer interesting throughout. Definitely a new favorite from Zero Gravity.,4.7
Oktoberfest,"Not sure if I expected more or the last Märzen beer I had (Spaten) altered my taste a bit.
Poured very nice looking golden amber but the head was nearly mia. Odd for an Oktoberfest beer.
The aroma was good, bready malts, a touch of sweetness, maybe caramel, and no discernible hops.
The taste followed, very pleasant bready malts that’s slightly sweet in an indiscernible way. Pretty traditional Märzen style, and good.
The feel was subdued just a bit, maybe the lack of head was an indication of loss of carbonation. But it was still really quaffable.
OA, glad to try this, it’s currently the highest rated Märzen style I’ve had but not my favorite.",4.05

Taste on the other hand hits all the right notes. Malty, toasty, sweet, and caramel. Dinner table bread in a glass.

Dryish mouth, light finishing coat on the tongue and throat.

In a style that floods the package stores by late August, Great Lakes' version is about as good as American Märzen gets.",4.37
Oktoberfest,"Haven't had too many beers of this style, but Great Lakes set the bar high for Marzens I have in the future. Doesn't lack in any category. It improves as it warms and finishes smooth and easy. 6 pk was $10.99 + tax. Recommend and I will be purchasing again.",4.21
Oktoberfest,"This is also solid and totally respectable. I think so far from what I've had from this area I like this one, Fat Heads and Thirsty Dogs the most. I think they're all about the same but this one has a real ""goes down easy"" feel to it. But overall a good standard Marzen",3.98
Oktoberfest,"1.5 x 12-oz Bottles
Best By: 17 Nov, 2021
Consumed on: 24 May, 2022
Glass: 0.5 L Fest Mug
Serving Temp: 51.2 F


Look:
Deep and bright golden-hued copper that becomes dark gold when held to a light. 2-finger off-white creamy head slowly dissolves to a very thin but consistent cover. Lacing along the glass is excellent.

Smell:
The nose is somewhat restrained. Lightly toasted grains and sweet bready malts. Biscuity. There is a very, very slight note of grass.

Taste:
Early notes of toasted caramel and bread dough give way to a noticeable but not overpowering hop bite and a moderate earthy bitterness. There is a nice balance. As the beer warms slightly, some vinous notes appear. Things finish dry, with the alcohol making an appearance at the very end and in the aftertaste.

Feel:
Crisp and dry. Body is medium, with a lean to the light side.

Overall:
This is not completely on-style for an Oktoberfest/Marzen, but it is a fine beer nonetheless. I view this beer as more of a Heller/Amber Bock (perhaps even a Maibock) and in that respect it is quite good. A good beer for a cool fall day or spring night. YMMV.",3.71
Oktoberfest,"12 oz bottle, best by 11/17/21.
Samuel Adams Ugly Sweater Run Pint Glass.

Burnt sienna/orange color with a half finger of head that runs out the back door with its hair on fire. No head left after 10 seconds.

Aroma of moldy grain and wet leaves, with hints of caramel, pumpkin, and faint citrus.

This beer is pretty full-flavored. Hoppy but not too hoppy, malty but not too malty. It opens with smoked caramel notes and hints of pumpernickel bread. Halfway through, the hop bite comes in and brings a robust medicinal bitterness a la Ricola but it's not gross and fits in nicely. It finishes on orange peel, smoked apricot, and spicy notes. The 6.5% is already hitting me.

Feel is crisp, moderately oily, semi-smooth, and brings a wave of alcohol heat on the back end.

Overall, this could be marketed as an imperial Oktoberfest, as it's quite the pumper. This is a very tasty beer and an excellent example of the style. I would absolutely buy this again if I were in the mood for an Oktoberfest. This would go really good with spicy mustard and doughy pretzels. Wow.

$1.66 / Binny's",4.12
Oktoberfest,"Frankly surprised by this beer being listed as Outstanding. It's a marginal marzen. It looks the part--amber, off-white foamy head. But the flavors, though malt forward, are weak and lacking in substance. There is a bit of Noble hop bounce that emerges late, but still a bland experience.",3.11

Flavor: Strong and bready flavors of bread, rich amber malt, caramel. Lots of toasted notes mix with the bread malt and caramel. Some floral notes and also some red notes as listed below. Rich bread malts, earthy, red, yet flavorful and sweet. (4.25)

Compared to 3 Sheeps Oktoberfest 9/5/22: Pours lighter, Milder aromas. Less toasted caramel and bread, earthy Munihc malt. More smooth bread and pale malts. Lighter and more pale.

2021 Review:
Appearance: Pours a beautiful, deep, but bright amber color with a small off white head. SRM of 13. (4.25)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread, grass, and earthy Munich malt with some flower and possibly caramel and bread spice. Hints of cherry and citrus hops too. (4.00)

Flavor: Bready and rich. A definite nice hint of earthy German flower and farm. Finishes very bready and with rich caramel. There is a rye, cherry and red apple hop flavor here too. Tastes like rich baking bread on a German farm on a rainy day. (4.25)

Feel: Medium-bodied. Well carbonated. Extremely balanced, and finishes clean and slightly sweet on the palate. (4.25)

Compared to Surly Oktoberfest: It's pours a darker amber with an off-white head. More bready and caramel malt flavors. Less spice and rye. Finishes smoother and sweeter. Less bitter.

Compared to Central Waters' Oktoberfest 9/5/20: Pours a lighter color with a lighter head. More dry bread and grass. Less dark bread, caramel, vanilla. Less sweet overall. Leans much more traditional festbier than American Marzen.

Compared to Founders Oktoberfest 9/20/20: Pours a similar color. Similar mild aromas. More red apple, cherry, and spiciness/tartness on the flavor. Less bready. More roasty, Americanizized and less roasty. More traditional.
10/31/20: Pours an identical color. More flower, citrus, cherry on the aroma/flavor. Less smooth caramel and honey. More red fruit and bitterness. Also more toasty. Nearly identical. (see below for 2021 comparison)

Compared to Odell's Oktoberfest 9/22/20: Pours a slightly lighter color. More bready aromas. Less spiced caramel and cherry liquor. Smoother, less spice and bite. Winner: Great Lakes.

Compared to Sam Adams Oktoberfest 12/30/21: Pours a lighter color. Hoppier aromas. More German noble hops and bread notes. Less rich caramel, cherry, and spice. More hoppy, bready, and Oktoberfest-like.

Overall: A very balanced, full, and American Marzen style. At first it drinks pretty standard and rounded. Nice flavors with some hints of flower and cherry spice. Wait until it warms. Caramel and slight chocolate malt shine as the beer warms. Exactly what I'm looking for in an Oktoberfest Marzen. Not overpowering but captures the right flavors. It's still slightly heavier bodied and stronger than a traditional festbier, but one of the best American versions of the style. This one is good, and It's bread spice in a glass. Strong, yet balanced and appropriate. Fantastic stuff here. (Final Rating: 4.23)
*Compare to any strong, yet balanced Marzen*",4.16

Oktoberfest,"Pours a clear amber from the bottle, brief head, no retention. Nose is brown bread, light baking spice, sweet malts - classic profile.

Oktoberfest,"Poured into a pint glass, a light, loosely carbonated two finger head forms, but begins to subside immediately. The color of this beer is beautiful.. it's golden amber inherently looks like autumn leaves.. apropo for an Oktoberfest beer! The nose is restrained, but good.. sweet grains with mild hops and malt notes. Adequate lacing does survive for 20 minutes. The taste of this Great Lakes brew, to me, is the styiistic definition of Octoberfest -Maarzen style. I have tried many other Octoberfests, first with Sam Adams, 30 years ago. This one gets everything right.. It is sweet, hops-malt balanced, with an earthy grain taste and fine mouth feel. More importantly, it does not bear the excesses of so many competitors.. no excessive hops skunkiness, no dryness, no lingering dirt aftertaste! It is a beautifully crafted, fully realized example of what an Octoberfest-Marzen should be! I'm sure I will continue to try other Octoberfests, but I expect to keep coming back to my fave by Great Lakes, every year!",4.21
Oktoberfest,"Dark in color and aroma, with a dark amber hue and no head and consistent toasted caramel note in the nose.

A little late hopping and a crisp, medium finish improve the final product as well.",3.93

Oktoberfest,"Disclaimer: I am using Oktoberfest to refer to any of the many styles brewed for Oktoberfest. I understand that Oktoberfest is not a style in and of itself.

Let me start this by start this by saying that, despite enjoying many Bavarian beers (and if I’m not a glutton for Bavarian food, I don’t know who is), I’m not sure that Oktoberfest-style beers have ever been my thing. I can drink dunkels for hours. -But give me 3 Oktoberfests instead? And I’ll probably drink no more than 2, and likely one 1. It’s not that I dislike them (as a group), just sometimes the Marzen’s are too pale, and in general they don’t seem to tickle me the way that something like a Dunkel would. That said, combine them with certain food styles, and they dramatically improve the drinking experience (for me, anyway).

Tonight is a new beer to me.

Great Lakes - Oktoberfest

6.5 %ABV, 20 IBUs

The beer is listed as a “Marzen style lager” on the can and on BA.

No canned on Date, but the can lists 10/25/2021, which I assume is a BBD, which I assume is a 90-day from Canned date, not a 45-day date, making this canned on 7/25/2021, putting this just shy of 2 months from canning. Picked up at a Kroger as part of a mix-6 pack of just Oktoberfests for this tasting. (Unfortunately I drank 4 before the tasting ever started, so…)

The beer was removed from a 45ish degree temp fridge after having been refrigerated for approximately 2 weeks. Beer poured into a classic Haufbrauhaus dimpled mug.

First Impression: Beer pours light in color – much closer to the straw-like yellows of a Pilsner than the golden-amber I normally expect from other Oktoberfests. No immediate aromatics.

Appearance: Pretty enough, but nothing special, although a little surprised at its’ light color. An appropriate amount of head for the style when first poured, which dissipated to nothing (with no lacing) almost immediately. Not swearing I am rating appearance correctly here, as appearance always feels quite subjective. 3.5

Smell: This beer is not extremely aromatic. My first test for any Oktoberfest beer is does it give me that quintisential “beer smell” and “beer taste”. What do I mean? It tastes like bier, bruh. I know this isn’t descriptive, but in my mind this is always what I think beer tastes and smells like. I’m tried to smell and describe this for 5-7 minutes now, and nothing is coming to me. It’s just non-descript except as “bier”. Think I say this every year. 4.0

Taste: A distinctively ‘bier’ taste that is not a pale as I might have expected for being called a marzen. Interestingly, this doesn’t strike me as being true to style, although I am no expert. I get some hints of banana and clove that I typically only find in dubbels, tripels, and quads. Maybe even a little bit of bubbelgum. It’s not on the front end, but the back, but also not much really left in the aftertaste. It’s right at the moment you swallow. (That’s what she said.) 3.75

Mouthfeel: Nothing unique or special. It feels (get it) true to style. If anything, it’s almost slightly too viscous for a marzen, as it is encroaching on dubbel territory. 4.25

Overall: This is fine. I’m not sure I like it that much, but I do appreciate that it’s a good beer. I also understand, truly, why so many people like it, and why there are so many fans here on BA. That said, again, I don’t think it’s really right for me. I won’t be buying a 6-pack or multiples each year, but I very well may buy a single most years. 4.25

BA Review Score: 3.95
In retrospect, I think a score of 3.95 is pretty fair. I think it’s close to or right around a solid B. I’d be hard pressed to give it any higher than a B unless I am comparing it to other beers. Of the 5 total Oktoberfests I have had this year so far, this isn’t the worst, but it’s also not my favorite. I’d probably say it’s right in the middle. This beer did make me go fry up a Knockwurst and a Bier bratwurst, though. Spicy bratwurst mustard ready.",3.95
Hater Blockers,"Poured from a 16 ounce can dated 6/27/22 into a snifter.

Flavor: Strong and candied flavors of lemon, candied pineapple, sweet mango. Some lightly astringency citrus and pineapple notes, almost a burn. The finish is sweet with some hopburn.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Leaves a hop burn and sweetness on the palate.

Compared to Equilibrium Mast Theory 8/6/22: Pours a lighter color, milder head. More sweet candied pineapple, orange, and paint. Less creamy mango, papaya, guava, creamsicle.

Overall: Not the best offering from Drekker. This one has appreciable hop burn. Overripe orange, pineapple, and cantaloupe flavors. Paint-like. A lingering hop burn. Finish was sweet and low carbonation. Not up to par with their usual products. (Rating:",3.52

T: Tasted of a decent shot of tropical fruit (mango, in particular), some coconut (more than expected; a good addition), a moderate amount of hops (less than usual for a DIPA), light malt (mostly in the finish - it gets drowned out by the fruit), and a lot of citrus (tangerine).

feel: nice smooth carbonation. body feels heavier than you would expect, but medium-light at the same time. easily drinkable, goes down smooth.

overall: pretty good pale lager. more interesting than some other macro brews, but not quite up to craft standards. locally it was purchased at $10.99 for a 4x pack of 450mL glass swing-top bottles. not the cheapest for what you get but still an overall nice drinking experience. i would recommend this to a friend.",3.37
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Grolsch was made for cigar smokers. It holds up really well to the muting properties of cigar smoking. Hardly a beer fares better under the scrutiny of the cigar’s influence on the palate, yet remains subtle and refined.",4.33
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"April 2002: Rerate: More flavour than the other Dutch macrobrew lagers, still I'm far from ecstatic. Clearly on the bitter (hoppy) side (too much bitterness for me), some sweetness too. Not as easily drinkable as Dommelsch. I had it on tap (in Holland) as well as can (have sampled the original bottle earlier), it didn't improve much from tap, unlike most beers.",3.02
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"So I deleted my last review and now I review again, as I think I just tasted my new favourite pilsner ever, Radeberger. An hour ago, this probably was. So I am going to review this again now to directly compare against it. From a corked bottle. If you try Grolsch from a can or an alternative bottle without a cork, it simply doesn't compare. I think the corked bottles are brewed in Holland, where as the others are brewed under licence, locally.

Fairly deep and dark for a pilsner...medium head with a combination of small and large bubbles.

Amazing aroma when you open the plastic cork...but actually the aroma from my pilsner glass is kind of frothy and a bit uninspiring. Especially after the Radeberger...

The flavour is nothing compared with Radeberger. That is now my favourite pilsner for sure. Now Grolsch really does taste like a mass market produced beer. I think the reason I gave it such a good review before, was linked to the rather terrible beers that I drank just before I drank it.

Hops are well balanced...kind of lightly Czech style. A little watery and uninspiring overall. Not much in the way of mouth feel, though there is some background bitterness that kind of lingers and comes to at the end. It tastes like it might have been pasteurised for a bit too long...but I guess for mass markets it needs to be.

One hour ago I really loved this, now after tasting it and reviewing while fairly sober, not so much ; )",2.44
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Pale golden / straw in color, and quite well filtered for excellent clarity. Rather good and “scrubbing” carbonation is evident (and is equally evident across the palate).

Nose is neutral and “lager” like, with a better than average, upfront Noble hop character. Slightly sour/sharp… Pils like, and somewhere between a Pils and a Helles if I had to place it, but clearly more character to my mind than that of it’s obviously more successful competitor, Heineken. On the other hand, the malt character is on not as evident. Perhaps a result of the use of corn or another (in the “classic” sense of the word adjunct) adjunct? All signs would point to “Yes.”

Sweet and very slightly sour/acidic/sharp across the palate on the first sip. Good aromatic character (the really carbonation helps, here), and an almost herbal quality beneath its sweeter malt base. Tastes at once both richer -and- lighter in body: a contrast and a conflict. Even though it is not as “hoppy” as anything in the c.f. “Craft Beer era”, the hop bitterness does linger quite nicely throughout the drink.

Good mouthfeel, and the carbonation although ample, is much gentler than it first seems to be.

The taste for me is where this brand, Grolsch, has always shined over others of its very broad style of Euro Pale Lager. This is of course, judging from both memory (many previous encounters in many packaging and draught formats over the past thirty plus years), and re-reviewing a fresh, flip-top bottle — Best By: March 14 2023.

My rating is doubtless high, but for what it is Grolsch is a classic example of its style, and a longtime personal favorite.",3.56

Grainy and grassy, with a hint of peppery spice and lots of pleasant bitterness. Finish is clean and crisp, with no lingering off-flavors and no skunkiness. So is it a Pilsner or a Euro Pale Lager? Either way, it's pretty good.",3.82
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Attractive clear gold body with a large white head that left good lacing. Subtle aroma; malts impart a biscuit-like quality that pair well with the noble hops. No off notes, nothing skunky. A grainy, crisp, clean texture to the taste.

Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Drinking one of these takes me right back to my well-spent youth. I always preferred this to its other macro equivalents, Heineken and Stella Artois.

Yeah, I'm being a bit generous with my score, but this is a whole lot better than Heineken, and definitely better than Stella, so there you go.",4.0
Grolsch Premium Lager / Premium Pilsner,"Beautiful thick bottle, really really cool. Typical clear Pilsner look with a frothy white head. Smells like barley, unbaked bread, and other non sweet bakery goods, with I hate to say this, but a touch of weed. Simple taste, but clearly there is quality hops used which I can appreciate. Classic European Pilsner taste with its own thing going on coming from the hops. Refreshing but not exactly a summer type beer, like the lager of Guinness for myself (meaning, refreshing, but.. not a warm weather beer per say). Normal watery mouth feel, leaves a small aftertaste, especially at the back of your tongue. As you keep drinking the taste gets more casual, and being a Pilsner it’s not too complex, but you can still enjoy that different hoppy character that we see differently in European Pilsners, but that’s all you really get.
Short Verdict: better than ok, not great, but still enjoyable. Though I did drink it out of a old style beer bottle which could have enhanced it.",3.37

In the glass: golden/ light amber looks tasty, if only it was

Even though this brand has been passed around almost as much as my old girlfriend it still has the same qualitative taste. Many, many stories where the Grolsh was involved.

Hop-forward nose suffused with passion-fruit, lime zest, pink peppercorn, and grass. Bright, faintly tropical, and clean.

Medium-dry, faintly spicy, moderately bitter palate entry with hints of tropical fruit. Taste follows the nose. Crackery dry finish with a lasting smooth bitterness. Wonderful showcase of hops.

Faintly sticky, medium-light bodied, crisp, riding the line between satiating and refreshing.

Excellent, balanced, hop-forward WC IPA from Port - also a great value.",4.26

La Chouffe (Blonde),"Poured from a 330mL bottle, best by April 2023 into my belgian mini chalice

On the pour a 2 finger white head of fine and medium bubbles forms on top of a very hazy golden body with quite lively carbonation.

The aroma is very big and a bit musty right off the bat. This beer is all yeast and almost a bit barnyard like. Behind the immediate funk, there are banana esters that mingles with the coriander and light hops quite nicely to make a spicy orange like sweet aroma.

The flavor loses a lot of the barnyard that's on the nose but the esters are still present and quite nice as they lead into the once again spicy coriander and phenol character. That is followed by a nice light blonde malty crackery note that mixed with a solid but subtle bitterness.

Feel is not as big as the ABV would imply, as it is honestly a refreshing beer. The carbonation bite is quite intense and the head makes for a nice creaminess every sip. It has a very long finish and the malts coat your mouth on the final evolution.

Overall this is a very interesting belgian, however I don't have a lot of experience with these big blegian light beers. Very similar to a tripel but with some barnyard notes and extra hopping. Quite a strong beer.",4.21
La Chouffe (Blonde),"Appearance: Pours a clear, medium orange color with a massive head. SRM of 9. (4.25)

Aroma: Strong aromas of orange citrus and wheat predominate. Belgian spices including coriander and floral notes. European bread malts present through the end.

Flavor: Strong flavors of orange, coriander, Belgian spices. Some floral notes, but a nice dose of coriander in the middle that dissolves into a strong yeasty and bready mouthfeel. Plenty of Belgian and German spices. More German bread and oranges on the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Massive carbonation, yeast, and a billowing mouthfeel. Finish is bready sweet, but so much yeast to balance it out.

Overall: A very authentic and classic Belgian Pale Ale for a reason. Fantastic orange, bread, coriander, flower and Belgian spices. This is only upfront. Then comes a large yeast mouthfeel to completely dry the palate for the rich and smooth bread malt that follows. Rounds out into an absolute banger of a Belgian Ale.

$8.79 @ Total Wine & More, Cherry Hill, NJ

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured an opaque black body beneath a finger's width of brown foam although that eventually fell and now I have nothing left, not even a thin collar. That's OK, this is a strong beer at 13.5% ABV so it's to be expected. The aroma is quite rich with notes of Bourbon, coconut, hot chocolate fudge, oak, roastiness, alcohol, and a very distant smokiness. The flavor follows with everything found in the aroma and additional notes of soft ripe banana, sweet apple, some nuttiness that includes almond, and cinnamon. The label states that it's aged on cherries but I get very little of that, and only at the swallow and in the lingering finish. It's sweet, and I'm not sure how much bitterness it has but the alcohol helps to dry it in the end. The alcohol is noticeable but I feel it's at a good level, and maybe even a very good level for a beer of 13.5%. If it wasn't there I think it would probably seem weird. It's full bodied and dextrinous with a moderate carbonation level that at least partially explains the lack of head retention. If that's a trade off for the slick and oily mouthfeel I'll take it. I've had richer, stronger, and more complex beers like this but there's something incredibly compelling about this one. I drank the first half of it way too quickly and now I have to wonder if this would even work for me as a late night sipper while reading because I might just drink it all and pass out! It just occurred to me that this is listed as an ""IMPERIAL MILK STOUT"" but there's no mention of lactose on the label. I'll assume it's in there, and it doesn't bother me, but for someone who's lactose intolerant it could be an issue. This was a pricey beer, I have to say, and I don't usually mention the cost because it has nothing to do with the beer itself but I want to say that even at $8.79 a bottle (73¢/oz.) I'd happily buy it again. I doubt that a 4-pk is going to get me through the winter, but 2 might work. Absolutely worth trying.
Review #8,230",4.36
Dismembers Only,"Dark mahogany with a finger of dark khaki foam head. Dissipates fairly quickly into a wisp and crown that leave rings of lacing.

Dark malts and chocolate brownies in the nose. Not much cherry or banana to speak of, but maybe a hint of nondescript fruitiness.

The roastiness and high quality chocolate stand out again in the taste. There is some detectable banana, but I’d have a hard time picking it out blind. Instead, it rounds out the edges. There’s a touch of cherry in the finish.

Huge creamy thickness to the mouthfeel. Just enough carbonation to keep it lively.

The fruits very subtle, adding some depth to the superb malts and chocolate and world class mouthfeel. Excellent beer.",4.33
Dismembers Only,"I was hesitant to buy this as it seemed, well, not my cup of tea. But I did and that’s not a bad thing.
Poured black and capped with a brown head that dissipated but managed to exist for the entire drink.
The aroma was roasted malts, bourbon, banana and chocolate.
The taste followed, sort of. Got the bourbon up front, tons of roasted malts, tart cherries and chocolate. The banana, for me, was more like an essence than a flavor. I think it served to soften the tart of the cherries. No bitterness at all.
The feel was smooth and viscous, just what one would expect for a BBA Imperial Milk Stout.
Good beer, despite my misgivings.",4.27
Dismembers Only,"Extremely cherry forward. Excessively sweet. Remarkably tame and not hot for 13.5% and quite gentle on the mouthfeel.

Overall, after one sip I knew I was glad I only bought a single of this. Way, way, way too much cherry.

It's literally 1/3 marichino cherry juice and 2/3 solid BB stout. Literally. Popped some berberine because I feel pre-diabetic. Dumped the rest.

Solid beer when you only want 0.5oz. Beyond that it can fuck off.",3.88
Dismembers Only,"I don't see any date listed on the bottle or the label.

Appearance: The body is black and it looks a little dark brown near the surface. The head starts pouring dark brown but becomes more of a khaki color as it forms into a short cap over the surface. The head fades out rather quickly and it leaves a thin creamy textured ring on the surface of the beer, with a few larger bubbles along the edge of the ring. It leaves small spots of lacing on the glass that are spaced apart but manage to stick to the glass. Smaller bubbles cascade off the edges of the glass but don't last.

Aroma: There is a nondescript alcohol aroma that hits the nose at first, but it is quickly displaced by the light aroma of wet wood and bourbon. Notes of chocolate come through around the edge but it mostly is a mixture of alcohol and bourbon. The aroma as a whole is pretty mild but as the nose approaches the glass closer to pick up more aroma it is always met with a strong nondescript alcohol scent.

Taste: Up front there is a pleasant flavor of chocolate which tastes like milk chocolate at first, then transforms into dark chocolate shortly after. It is like biting into a Hershey's milk chocolate bar then biting into a Hershey's Special Dark bar. The middle of the palate is more of the same; a slightly sweet chocolate flavor with a touch of bitter dark chocolate. It finishes without much of a change in flavor but there is a very light boozy quality on the finish. As a whole it just tastes like chocolate and it leans on the sweeter side.

Mouthfeel: It is smooth, full bodied, and very easy to drink. The label says that this has an ""ALC. 13.5% BY VOL."" and from the perspective of drinkability, it drinks exceptionally well. There is a light bitterness in the beer that comes across as dark chocolate but it is mostly on the sweet side.

Overall: It is a pleasant chocolatey beer with a high ABV that is mostly hidden with the exception of the aroma. The label says that this is an ""IMPERIAL MILK STOUT AGED IN BOURBON BARRELS WITH COCOA NIBS, CHERRIES AND DRIED BANANAS ADDED."" The milk stout portion definitely comes through with a smooth body one would expect from a milk stout, and a sweeter edge. This beer is actually sweeter than a lot of the Milk Stout and Imperial Milk Stout beers available on the market. The bourbon barrel character comes through in the aroma but it seems to be missing in the flavor department. The cocoa nibs definitely come through as the beer has a lot of chocolate character. The chocolate is really what steals the show here and it is quite excellent. The cherries and dried bananas don't seem to come through at all unless they are contributing to some of the residual sweetness. As a whole I would recommend the beer because it drinks very well and it has a great chocolate flavor. I would not recommend it to those looking for all of the advertised flavors. I would probably drink it again, knowing that the beer as a whole is good.",3.8

Cyber Scream,"16 oz can, no date printed on the bottom (risky move, I know).
Served in Dogfish Head Nonic Pint.

Has a nice juicy body, blonde in color, quite a bit of creaminess, with a creamy head of 1 finger. Leaves a few splotches of lace here and there as it recedes to half its size.

Aroma is juicy pithy citrus and a nice hit of diesel and kviek yeast. It's pretty dang juicy smelling. I get notes of peach, mango, grapefruit, and orange pith. A little cantaloupe action, too.

Flavor is bitter pithy grapefruit, some lemon peel, diesel, orange peel, and then burnt rubber. I also get a little bit of adhesive or paint thinner. You can taste every bit of alcohol in this beer. It's abrasive and harsh. The rubber aspect also really distracts from anything else in the beer. You taste it last, and it stays on the palate like an unwelcome guest. It doesn't encourage further sips. I feel this one needs more malt peeking through.

Feel is juicy and slightly acidic, with lots of paint-peeling ethanol burning a hole in the throat. The beer continues to burn after its finish. The 10% is the main attraction.

Overall, their way of putting beer together is a mystery to my palate. It never seems to work. Always homebrew quality, always professional-level price tag. Definitely one of the shabbier 3xIPAs I've ever had. It's a super hot beer; lots of paint thinner and bitter citrus rinds. Not tasteless like their other IPAs, but wrought with flaws. Working through this one has become a bit of a chore as it does not invite the palate back for more. I drank 60% of it over the course of an hour (and a few other beers) before retiring it to the drain. I gave it a fair shake.

Galactic Rhymes,"Sweet pineapple tropical hoppy, hint of stonefruit, and hint of earthy galaxy nose on this one! Taste follows with a soft and delicious, pineapple juicy, and earthy hoppy bitter finish. I'm not the biggest galaxy fan, but this is well done!

Reviewed as: New England Triple / Imperial IPA
Glass: North Park 16.5-oz. Munique glass
Price: $24.00 for a 4-pack
From: Monkish Brewing Company in Torrance, Calif.
Purchased: Aug. 26, 2020
Consumed: Aug. 26, 2020
Misc.: Canned on Aug. 25, 2020; Used to be named Galactic Rhyme Federation Championship

Was lucky enough to pick up a 4-pack of this one and other one with my stay up in Manhattan Beach. Monkish’s website called it, “TRIPLE IPA featuring G-A-L-A-X-Y hops (new shortened name of ""Galactic Rhyme Federation Championship.”” Have to say I prefer the name Galactic Rhyme Federation Championship. But anyway, I used to hate Galaxy but have really been coming around to it this quarantine. Looking forward to it.

Poured a golden hazy color with three fingers of frothy white head. Lots of bubble streams coming up along the sides of the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent foamy lacing. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled big Galaxy, passion fruit, nectarine, peach, pineapple and some grapefruit rind. Not as good out of the can. (Smell - 4.50)

First thing I thought on the taste was how smooth it was for 10.2 pct. Second, damn this was good. In order got Galaxy, passion fruit, peach, nectarine, pineapple, grapefruit rind and some peppery spice. (Taste - 4.50)

Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, juicy finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Damn. Just a terrific hazy Triple IPA, especially for a single-hopped beer. World-class. (Overall - 4.50)

Trappist Extra,"Despite its 17 year history in the U.S, I just bought my first Extra from The Beer Temple (Chicago, as there may be others explicitly or implicitly.) I feel more than a little blessed that this copy is under six months from its bottling date. And I doubt seriously the rest of the 4-pack I bought will last 2022... even if I try to show show some extra monastic discipline.
That said, here is my first cut at a review.

Poured into my Westmalle goblet, Extra Looks like it has had careful breeding: the head is full, the remaining foam is semi-active and the lace is average. Smells tell me what I'm getting: fruit and balance. Tastes deliver: not heavy, not trying to prove anything; just trying to get along with a humble meal; whatever it may be that evening. Medium-mouthed, Extra does its job as a table ale and, actually, improves my mediocre cooking.

As for my high Overall Rating, that belongs to Westmalle. The Brothers now have graced me with the same ale that they drink. I will try to be more transcendent and more worthy of Extra.

9/23/22. The leftovers needed a pick-me-up and Extra did its job very well. I hope to visit this more than every 17 years.",4.02
Trappist Extra,"11.2oz bottle. Poured out a slightly cloudy, golden yellow color with a large, white head of bubbly foam. It left sudsy trails of lace on the glass. It smelled of bubblegum, fruity notes, caramel and hay. Sweet fruity taste with caramel, some spices and a mild bitterness.",4.02
Trappist Extra,"Lemon-gold body shimmers with a slight haze, forms a vigorous frothy white head, solid and lasts forever.
Aromas of spicy and fruit yeast notes, banana, lemon zest, whole grain cracker.
Flavour is predominantly crisp fresh grain malt, a bit grassy, some hay, with a bitterness like a peach pit; dash of lemon acidity, white grapefruit; feel is super dry, very fine medium carbonation, medium/light body, flavour lingers.

Super refreshing, tasty yet sessionable, a great summer choice.",3.88
Trappist Extra,"330 ml bottle served cold into a Chimay chalice. LCBO purchase for$3.95 CDN.

Appearance - Semi hazy golden brew, with two plus fingers of rocky white head and lots of visible carbonation. Outstanding head retention.

Smell - Candi sugar, lots of grainy, some powdery doughnuts and other bready aspects. Light fruit accents, maybe pears and peaches.

Taste - Light and grainy. Some candi sugar, fruit accents of apples and pears, just a int of bitterness on the back end to keep things balanced. Delightful.

Mouthfeel - Quite fizzy, medium light body, goes down so easily. Refreshing brew to drink and just semi-dry to close.

Overall - Excellent brew from one of the best Belgium has to offer. One of those beers you can appreciate without trying to go too deep. Layers of complexity that sometimes I might notice one day and not another which makes Trappist Extra simultaneously more nuanced and also easier to enjoy than almost any others in the style.",4.09

The nose smells like Yankee Candle so it’s a surprise when this delivers a lean and mean pale ale.
The malts are barely there, the water is salty, the cloves + hops double up to deliver real spice, and the scraping bitterness scrubs everything before it. You could not have designed a more direct, minimalist beer.
Lighter, fizzier, more bitter + less estery than St. Bernardus 4. Plays out almost like a baby Duvel, but not as full and sweet(!)
It’s wonderful for what it is, just be ready for it.

Drinks like a beer made by men who prize simplicity.",4.24
Trappist Extra,"Pours a hazy golden color with a huge top of white head that dissolves slowly and leaves some sticky lacings on the glass.
Aroma is of ripe bananas, citrus peels, honey, white bread, grass, spices, herbal and floral hops.
The taste is dry with grassy and herbal notes allong with some yeasty fruit notes. The finish is medium bitter with some herbal and floral hop notes. Quite nicely ballanced, and it leaves a long aftertaste. Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth with a medium carbonation and a medium body.
A really nice and tasty belgian pale ale. Perfect for a summer day.",4.13
Trappist Extra,"Pours a clear golden color with a huge, spongy white head atop.

On the nose, this offers aromas of dried garden herbs, floral chamomile and lavender, as well as fresh cut straw among buttery white bread dough.

Drinks refreshing with a sparkly effervescence during the beer’s finish, making it easy drinking and utmost thirst quenching at the same time.

Tastes of whole grain bread, lighter toffee and a well nuanced, lighter hop dryness, featuring a note of blueberries, old lime zest and flowery garden herbs, which lend an intriguing bitterness to the flavors. Has a dry, hay supported middle part, which effectivly cuts out any sweetness, while producing a refreshing, mineralic effervescence. Finishes soft, crisp with a late, yet typical Belgian spice profile, featuring Kardamom, allspice and a note of cotton Candy, getting wrapped up by lingering leafy hops.

The beer is perfect for the summer, dry and refreshing with a rewarding complexity, while it has a remarkably low abv, in regards of other traditional Trappist brews.",4.17
Trappist Extra,"the one of three held in the lowest esteem, obviously, but it’s still rather pleasant, thing pours bloody all head, what beer is there is a cloudy golden colour, good levels of carbonation within, lot of belgian yeast aroma on the nose, herbal, floral, vanilla, minerally, sweet, caramel, orange, lemon, beer tastes nice, some white bread and biscuit malt, bubblegum, lemon, orange, floral, vanilla, banana, little bit of bitterness on the finish, beer is super light bodied, highly carbonated, quite dry, a little bit watery, it’s a nice beer, but of course not in the same league as the other two",3.76

Bright golden & translucent, topped with a 1cm, bright white head that's foamy & holds really well too. It's floral smelling with some faint earthy malt bitterness with touches of yeast & spice too; there's some grassy notes & grain with a hint of banana at the end too. It's very effervescent & lively with more of the banana sweetness on the taste, a lot of floral hops & herbs too then the earthy bitterness towards the middle. A very lively beer on the palate before getting dry at the end, with a little yeast & faint cloves to finish.",3.8

S- Floury grain plus some of the same spicy notes, though mild here, found in weissbier.
T- Bright, refreshing, mild grains, into some hoppy dryness.
F- A pleasant beer for summer, bright and with some flavour to keep it a notch above mass-market lager.
O- But, I'm quite surprised by this beer. I lived for three years in Berlin (incl. drinking every variety of German beer I could find) and this just seems a really pedestrian beer versus it's current rating of 89% here; just shy of 'Outstanding' hmmm?

Bright solid golden color with a thick head with great retention.

Surprisingly refreshing and original flavor with notes of oranges, floral fresh hops, pineapple juice foam, wheat sourness and a bit of candied sugar. Dry aftertaste with a flavoring mild bitterness.

Interesting Belgian Blonde Ale with nice fresh hop and wheaty notes.",3.71
Trappist Extra,"2 fingers of white foam, fine, medium and coarse bubbles, lasting long time. yellow body, poured without the sediment from the bottle and therefore clear. plenty of fine carbonation
Belgium yeast character, more banana then phenols, a bit of Pilsner malt expressed by a little grainyness

Plenty of carbonation makes it burpy but also really refreshing, very fine prickly carbonation
Refreshing dry and bitter everyday beer for the monks",4.08
Trappist Extra,"33cl bottle, both fresh and 2d before bb.

Slightly hazy light yellow, nice foam.

Aroma is honey and white fruits when young, when aged, the honey dominates.

Taste has a strong bitterness component, speaking relative to the style. Some of it is coriander seed. The body is medium. The focus is on the honey from the light sugar mixing with fruit notes from the yeast. As the beer ages, the honey intensifies and hop bitterness recedes. So, best drunk fresh for sufficient complexity. Would benefit from a bit more body in my opinion. The use of sugar to this extent in a this low abv beer would require darker/crystal malts and hop aroma to counterbalance it.

In summary, worth looking for when fresh. But not perfect for the style at least when bottled. Would probably be at its best from tap.",3.83
Trappist Extra,"Have been wanting to try this for a long, long time. I very much enjoy Westmalle Dubbel and Tripel, so this is a special treat.

Best before date on bottle is 11/10/19, so quite fresh. Shipped to me from Belgium.

Colour is beautiful golden yellow, a bit of haze — not transparent, but translucent. Aroma of spices, light coriander, faint citrus — maybe lemon — underlaid with a pleasant hop aroma. Slight white head, not a lot of lacing.

Wow, this is carbonated! Almost like drinking mineral water or a soft drink. Body is excellent for the gravity, not thin. Surprisingly hoppy, bitterness stays with you after a sip. Yeast character is present, but seems much milder than in the dubbel or tripel. Slight Juicy Fruit-like flavour, rather nice.

Overall bright, not too sweet, ample hopping and carbonation. A nice Belgian pale, although not as balanced as its burlier siblings. Would prefer a bit less intense hop character here given the gravity. I enjoyed Taras Boulba yesterday, and it may seem crazy, but there are aspects of this beer that are reminiscent of that one. Prefer TB, but this is probably the best patersbier/enkel I’ve had yet. Not worth going out of your way to buy, but pleasant and interesting if you can get it.",3.83
Trappist Extra,"Look: Golden yellow, visibly heavily carbonated, and a huge frothy white head.

Smell: Sweet citrus, fruit, honey, and a bit of wheat and grass.

Taste: Very mild. Hints of grass, malt, and a faint hop bitterness at the end.

Mouthfeel: Thin and extremely, sharply carbonated.

Overall: The monk's equivalent to a lawnmower beer. Light, refreshing, and extremely effervescent.",3.99
Trappist Extra,"Poured from fridge temperature. Pours a nice golden yellow. Nice white head that sticks around for a while. Aroma is pine, lemon, and other citrus peel.

31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"The pour was a deep golden color with a haze. The head was about an inch thick of a tan white color. The taste to me was like a regular Oktoberfest but with a hint of pumpkin. Overall, this is one I'll be drinking again.",4.0
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"Very similar idea as the beer I had the night before (Munchen on Pumpkin from Devil's Backbone). A good lager that just happens to have pumpkin spices too!! Poured from a 12 oz can into a pint glass, this beer featured a mostly clear brownish/amber color with a lot of light coming through. The medium sized off-white/light khaki head had better than average retention and there were lots of patches of light filmy lacing on the glass. A good looking beer!!!! Aroma and taste were mostly rich bready and caramel malt with some pumpkin spicing and a little vanilla. Very pleasant, with the pumpkin spices subdued. The rich malty beer was featured, the pumpkin spices were a mild enhancement. Mouthfeel was rich and slightly sweet. A very easy sipper!!!! I would drink this one again.",3.77
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"The pour is mahogany brown colored with a fair amount of carbonation. The taste is pumpkin, mild pumpernickel bread note, cinnamon, & all spice. Cheers! B",3.89
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"From the can, it pours a clear pumpkiny amber color with a nice off-white head that slowly reduces. Pumpkin spice in the nose. The mouth gets a sharp pumpkin spice flavor with a roasty caramelly malt base. Mild caramelly aftertaste.",3.51
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"All treat and no trick indeed. Dark amber color, very smooth and medium bodied, this German style pumpkin spiced lager was a delight from start to finish. Cinnamon, clove and pumpkin tingling my senses throughout this experience. Munich dunkel + fall spices = Halloween gold. Cheers DuClaw!",3.97
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"Pours a burnt orange color with a bit of head. Maybe didn't pour hard enough, because the carbonation was almost too intense like Coke. Smells faintly of pumpkin and an okay scent. Taste is like a lager with a hint of pumpkin, with spices like cinnamon following. Not bad at all for a lager, but not my preference for pumpkin beers.",3.77
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"Brown cinnamon oatmeal. Raisin dotted yam casserole, browned mallows and all. Zucchini bread. Unspecified fruit and nut muffin. The flavor is artificial but homey like chocolate coated Christmas Tree Shoppe. High style marks.",3.75
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,An okay pumpkin beer. The appearance is the best aspect of this beer. It pours a reddish hue with a decent head and lacing. Overly spiced and a bit cloying. But at least it's drinkable.,3.16
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"September 17, 2018
I've had too many pumpkins lately. Or maybe too much brown ale with a little pumpkin. Some boozy. Some not. This one is a bit different but with a similar result. A pumpkin-ish brew.

It pours light brown with very little head. This was a can. The aroma is nice and malty. The taste is just a tad sweet for the style with a nice full, nutty aftertaste.

Seoptember 3, 2022
This seems nice and soft and creamy. The base is more of a lager but the head and nose are quite good. The taste is pretty big on spice but not over the top. A very drinkable pumpkin beer.

Recommended. A nice change of pace from the brown ale based pumpkin brews.",3.75
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/27/2016. Pours crystal clear deep orange/copper color with a small dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, light chocolate, herbal, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, spices, and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with solid strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, light chocolate, herbal, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal hop and spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cinnamon, nutmeg, herbal, pepper, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, spices, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness, increasing through the glass. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and moderately grainy/bready/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.7%. Overall this is a very nice spiced Munich dunkel lager style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, spices, and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; very smooth, clean, and easy to drink. A bit more bitter/drying than the classic style due to the spice presence; but very well balanced and spot on otherwise. A very enjoyable offering.",3.78
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"Pours clear, amber in color with 1/3 inch head. Taste is caramel, dark bread, with medium amounts of vanilla, and lesser amounts of cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove at the end. Sweet and medium bodied. Tastes like a marzen with light pumpkin spices that slowly build up. Not over the top spicing at all. A pumpkin beer for those that like more of a beer taste. Above average, worth a try even though I prefer others in the style.",3.59
31 Pumpkin Spiced Lager,"12 oz bottle served in a snifter. 5.7% ABV listed on label.

Slightly heavier than moderate amounts of lacing are observed.

S: Light to moderate aromas of roasted pumpkin, roasted pumpkin seeds, caramel malts, and pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and allspice).

T: Upfront there is a light to moderate flavor of caramel + bready malts with a light to moderate amount of brown sugar sweetness. That is followed by light to moderate flavors of roasted pumpkins and roasted pumpkin seeds with a moderate flavor of pumpkin pie spices (nutmeg and allspice) in the finish. No perceptible hop presence.

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,"My first Weihenstephaner, the Dunkel pours a cloudy tea color and has a thick creamy head that looks like a root beer float. The smell is awesome like their hefeweizen and is a bit muted on the fruit aromas. The taste is pure joy. Is close competition to my favorite Franziskaner which isn't readily available lately. The mouthfeel is pure heaven and is just so smooth and sweet, words can explain it's greatness. Overall I will be picking a couple of these up at the store to keep around. Greatness in the bottle. Love at first taste.",4.7
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,"I HOPE to revise this review. Banana, toffee and butter are all present in a delicious way, but way too much muted metallic flavor. I'll give it another shot from a different store but its hard to say that this bottle was spoiled in any specific sense.",2.48
Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,"Had on tap at rhein haus in Denver

On arrival a fine 1 finger head was present with very nice retention and thick foamy rings of lacing. The body is an extremely hazy caramel amber with lively fine carbonation.


Aroma is strong Weiss esters with a strong banana note. Quite a sweet aroma from the malts as well but any obvious malt smells are covered by the big traditional yeast. Sweet and yeasty.

Taste is much drier than the aroma would suggest with a big hit of yeast up front without a lot of sweetness, but some bright fruity and banana notes, then some nutty almost caramel roasted malts come in. The yeast here has a lot going on, and the malt lends an extra layer to the traditional hefe taste.

Feel is again very dry, but surprisingly drinkable bright and refreshing for how much much flavor is going on here. On the palate it is actually drying, but the finish is relatively long. The epitome of an anytime beer.

Overall this is a pretty fun weisse and Dunkel. Not as big as some craft interpretations, but the yeast is super traditional and the brewery is steeped in history.",4.01

Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier Dunkel,"Look: Poured at a slight chilled temperature from a 500 ml glass. Light brown pour but turns darker as the beer sits. A little bit of lacing as the foam dissipates from the beer.
Smell: As soon as this poured I got strong immediate aromas of banana bread - similar to the banana bread beer. Also got notes of slight caramel, toffee, maybe even some fruits in there too. My mouth is already watering!!
Taste: Getting a sweet taste of banana bread (this flavor is the dominant flavor) with hints of caramel molasses and toffee. Nice malty drink!!!
Feel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Very easy to drink.
Overall: I have to say I’m impressed. I had this beer not to cold but it really packed a punch of flavors. Also for the price of $4.50 for a pint - after taxes is a really good deal!!! I’m surprised how affordable this good beer is. I’d say it could be a $6 beer easily.",4.37

Semi-dry with medium-high bitterness, Toasted malt with a hint of juice, again the big hops are balanced by malt. The dryness and bitterness are consistent throughout the drink. The finish is lager-like, fast and almost crisp with the malt rounding out the finish. Bold, bitter and spicy hops linger during the aftertaste.

Medium light bodied with soft and lasting carbonation. I must say balanced again, in spite of the big hop profile the malt is plentiful and complimentary to the hops. No surprises here just malt and hops with a hint of fruity esters. I consider this an East Coast IPA and my favorite so far.",4.67

Lager Town,"16oz can purchased from the fridge as a single for $3.75. Canned on 07/18/22, so this is 8 weeks and a day old.

Look: Pours a rich amber color with a fluffy, slightly rocky beige head. The head gradually died down to a very thin layer.
This beer is crystal clear. Looks awesome.

Smell: Has a very nice combination of aromas - it's bready and toasty, with notes of caramel, toffee, root beer, and cream soda, which is counterbalanced by a spicy hop character on the finish that smells grassy and herbal, almost minty. It's cool that this can smell both creamy and spicy. There are some nice secondary notes of honey and fresh Spring floral aromas.

Taste: Very refreshing. Personally, I think that they really nailed the balance of flavors. Up front, it has a touch of acidity along with a malt-forward profile of caramel and chocolate. It doesn't take very long for the malt-forward profile to quickly fade away and yield to the hoppy, relatively dry finish. The finish has a mild to moderate, lingering bitterness with woody, coffee-like and roasty notes. Lingering notes of orange zest, pepper, and black cherry soda on the finish also.

Feel: Lighter side of medium bodied with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel. It's really crisp and clean, and perfectly carbonated.

Overall: It's no surprise that I like this. I'm a big fan of Half Acre and while this is a lot hoppier than a traditional Marzen, I find it to be very flavorful and drinkable. The maltiness up front is nicely balanced by the hoppy finish. Prost!",4.25
Lager Town,Clear copper color with a finger of dense head. Slight caramel aroma but mostly bready and earthy. Munich malt flavor with a hint of caramel and toast. Slightly sweet with a bit of astringent finish. Good carbonation and medium body. This borders the line between festbier and marzen. I would have no problem drinking a lot of this in a beer garden.,3.72

Light scent, creamy feel, a depth of malt character that keeps me sipping: nutty, extremely sweet bread with just a kiss of pepper",3.56
Lager Town,"Appearance: Pours a clear, deep orange to mostly amber color with a strong off-white head. SRM of 15. Darker than most. (4.00)

Aroma: Moderate aromas of bread malts, earthy Munich malts, A smooth sweet and earthy caramel aroma. (4.00)

Flavor: Moderate flavors of bread malt, baked bread, and earhty honey sweetness underneath. Some caramel and booze linger as well. Finishes on the sweet side.

Feel: Medium to heavier bodied. Moderate carbonation to match. Finishes with a boozy caramel note, but not too sweet.

Compared to Eagle Park M.C. Hammerschlagen 9/8/22: Pours a darker color. Similar aromas. Slightly darker. More caramel amber malts, booze. Less light honey and honeyflower. Sweeter and heavier.

Compared to Revolution Oktoberfest 9/8/22: Pours darker, stronger aromas. More baked caramel, amber malts, booze. Less smooth honey and bread notes. Sweeter and heavier.

Overall: A pretty decent Märzen here. Nice baked bread and caramel flavors. Slightly heavier for the style and the booze shows here which is the one downside. The flavor is there though and it drinks very nicely and appropriate for a Marzen. (Rating: 3.90)",3.9

Lager Town,"November seems like a wonderful month to try an Octoberfest marzen. This one is poured from a pint can into a clear glass liter mug. The extra space is necessary. The temperature of the beer is probably less than or equal to 55 degrees American. The pour was bartender's experience gentle. Yet there's a huge foamy head, at least four inches high, taking up the upper third of the vessel. More troubling is that it's that starchy foam that recedes unevenly and warns that there's wheat in a wort to a level it doesn't belong. The part of the mug the head doesn’t hog is a bright and somewhat translucent dark copper. For a marzen, this one smells a little peculiar. There's some hoppiness, but nowhere near the malt character expected from the style. No, this just doesn't measure up to a good marzen. Doubtless, it wouldn't had it been consumed a month earlier. There's so little barley malt character to taste here, it might be a valued learning experience if it were explained how that was accomplished. The only sure characteristic typical of this style that's included is there's no hoppy bite. Other than that, it falls way short. Once again, the big foamy topper, instead of a nice proper head, proves to be an accurate harbinger of bad things to come.",3.03
Lager Town,"draught
Ivory, medium bubbled, thick head. Deep, medium light orange, with a bit of chestnut to round out the appearance. Aroma of malted honeydew melon, with a little sweetness to the aroma. The melon is in the taste, and clashes a bit with the other flavor, which is a subtle medium caramel toast malt.",3.83
Lager Town,"An excellent example of the category in true European style, which means minimal ingredients and maximum flavor. One has to ignore the American reviews pining for overloaded flavor: more bitterness, more this, more that. If you like true to the style European beers, and like Marzens, try this one. It's pretty similar to the Hofbrau or Ayinger versions.",4.43
Lager Town,"A decent, approachable Marzen but lacks complexity. This probably needed some bitterness to balance it out. Overall- light, not objectionable but also not noteworthy. Worth trying just to have another seasonal from this brewery",3.57
Lager Town,"Pours a deep opaque amber, frothy 2.5"" head that slowly recedes in thick pockets, lots of chunky lacing. Nose is rich brown bread, light brown sugar, earthy and spicy hop notes. Taste is certainly on the sweet side - leads with some pronounced malt sweetness, but there's a bit of tropical fruit lying underneath as well. It isn't too strong, but it lends a bit of brightness and juiciness. Not much bitterness to balance this out, which makes a full pint of this, at least to me, a bit of a drag. Mouthfeel is full and soft. Overall, would like some more bittering agent in here to scale back the sweetness, but its moderation keeps it from becoming a mess.",3.54
Lager Town,"Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a pillowy khaki colored head that has nice retention.

The aroma is of toasted brown bread and metallic notes. Touch of caramel.

The taste is of light brown bread and pennies. A grassy hop bitterness. Not much German notes.

Notes via stream of consciousness: It's poured a hazy deep copper colored body beneath a massive head of rocky off-white foam. The secondary pour to finish the glass has compacted the head a bit but it's still rocky on top, and displays both large and smaller bubbles within it. I don't find a lot of bubbles rising within, but the ones that are there are fairly small and rise slowly indicating that its got some body to it. The aroma is both malty and hoppy with notes of grain and spicy and floral hops. The flavor follows suit and it's bready, toasty, caramelish, spicy, lightly floral, mildy herbal, and a hint fruity with plum and raisin. It's sweetish but there's enough hop spice and bitterness to balance it perfectly and bring it to a dry conclusion. The hoppy spiciness and a touch of earthiness linger shortly. I'll certainly call this well-balanced and rounded. The body is medium and a bit dextrinous, and the carbonation is fine-bubbled and moderate.

Light body, soft on the tongue, not that dry or crisp with a low bitterness.

Crystal clear with a light gold color. The moderate head remains throughout the tasting with minor lumps and a continuous cascade of upward bubbles from the base of the glass. Minor spots on the glass remain after each sip.

Clean, refreshing soft malt start. It's a bit like a Helles, but the floral hop is distinctive, making this a beautiful example of the style.

The taste is a touch less soft on the tongue. There's a small berry-like presence. The body is neutral to full, richer than most pilsners. The carbonation is high as expected. The hop is still bittering but on the subtle side. Overall, a great example closer to the Czech version of pilsners.",4.37
Prince Percy,"Slow poured at Delaware Supply in Albany, NY.

This one pours a clear golden yellow color, with a big fluffy head and lots of lacing.

This smells like grainy malt, spicy hops, lemon rind, orange zest, and pith.

This is a little bit more hop forward than the typical pilsner, but that doesn't bother me too much, as it's definitely not overhopped. The malt character is really nice, with a light graininess, some breadiness, and a restrained sweetness. The hop character is spicy, herbal, slightly lemony, with a hint of citrus.

Prince Percy,"Prince Percy Pils

Pours a brilliant pale straw yellow - nearly crystal-clear, and topped with three fingers of rocky white foam with good retention. Significant pacing and visible effervescence.

Nose: Very rustic, grainy pilsner malt. Almost saison-like, with wholesome, grainy, hearty notes of rye, wheat, barley, and crackers. Very dry aroma. Lots if floral notes, some hop spiciness, tons of grass, hay, farmhouse, fresh rain, and a lemon-lime note. Extremely bright, zippy, and fruity for a pilsner.

Palate: Greets the palate nearly bone dry with lots of grain - almost like pale malt, and a really nicely hoppy profile with fresh grass, lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit pith, as well as a European spiciness and a kiss of resinous bitterness. There's a very lively minerality to this, similar to Suarez or Hill Farmstead. Thr finish sees a reduction in lemon-lime, and an increase in grapefruit pith, grass, spicy hop resins, and raw grains.

Mouthfeel/Body: As with most MBC beers, this is light, crisp, snappy, vibrant, bright, and and refreshing as possible. No malty sweetness or weight to weigh it down, but plenty of flavour to keep it full. Effervescence is incredibly lively and fizzy which really suits this well. Drying, slightly resinous finish.

Overall: I could go on and on about this, but all I really need to say is - this is the single greatest pilsner I've ever had. It's perfect. It's perfectly balanced, perfectly hopped, perfectly carbed, and just... Perfect! This is a world-class beer, so questions asked. If you enjoy pilsners, you need to have this. You'll understand.",4.55

Prince Percy,"Bottled on 5/29/20

Pours a clear and effervescent pale golden straw body topped with multiple fingers of tight, eggshell-white foam; good head retention leaves a steady finger of cap, with massive, foamy mounds eventually comprising the collar and chunky, thick strands of lacing covering the glass.

Aromas of crisp, crackery malt evolve to fresh black bread crusts, and a building, grassy hop presence upfront; floral tones, and semi-sweet cracked pepper mark the mid-palate's transition to highlighting underlying suggestions of sulfur, grapefruit and stone fruits developing on the close.

Taste opens with peppery bread dough and fresh grass as a floral mid-palate peaks; rounded fresh bread with hints of lemon, peach essence, and grapefruit on the back end offer nuance to an otherwise clean, toasty finish.

Mouthfeel brings a soft, light body with a deftly rounded moderate-high carbonation; effortless palate, delicately fluffy peak into a mildly gritty back end sporting an even milder, bitter finish.

Ample complexity drawn from a straightforward pilsner profile in large part due to a calculated dosing of hops, this is an overall satisfying, unencumbered American-made take on the style with near-universal drinkability courtesy of a delicate touch throughout.",4.2
Prince Percy,"Pale gold body; lively carbonation; thick and sculpted white head. Bright, light, and herbal aroma; soft sweetness.

S: It takes a little bit to open up. Once this warms, all the baked bread goodness come out that I love. Soft brown bread, doughy malts. A bit of toffee in the nose as well. Wonderful.
T: Like the nose, that nuanced malt character is amazing. Its like walking into a bakery. Doughy malts, brown bread. Toffee, a bit of dark fruits, just enough earthy hops to balance.

This is one were it really helps to let this warm. As it opens up beautifully. As usually for Ayinger, the malt character is on another level. This is the first time I have seen this on the shelf around me, I don't know why this has been hiding from me, but I'll be searching it from now on.",4.29

Aroma: Fresh baked brown bread, lightly toasted grains, melanoidin, toffee, wafts of dark fruit, bread dough, and light earthiness
Taste: Bread, dough, and grains intermingle up front and develop depth as toffee and earthy notes begin to weave their way in and join. Toffee holds center stage in the middle and oddly, the carbonation seems to dominate the dark fruit notes as I’m not getting much of them in the taste
Mouthfeel: Full, pretty high carbonation, clean, and a spritzy finish
Overall: I dig it. This is a tasty Dunkel and one I haven’t had in a while so it was fun to revisit. However, I feel like the carbonation needs dialing back a tad unless I just had an older bottle as it cut into several subtleties that the nose was alluding to but that seemed to instead be smothered by the spritzy and spicy carbonation. Still pretty good though",3.84
Ayinger Altbairisch Dunkel,"Poured the color of strong tea and the light brown head was never more than a cm tall but for all the world the carbonation looked like I had just poured a Coke.
The aroma, as for most to my poor, damaged nose, was mild. Only impressions of malts made it through. (Hence I seldom mark higher or lower)
The taste was not what I was expecting. Certainly very tasty and had elements of a dunkels that I have had in the past, but far lighter in density of flavor (if that makes sense) Still, it was quite refreshing and served its purpose well.
The feel I was less than amazed by - it certainly wasn't bad, but I think maybe the bottle I had was either old or something as despite the cola looking carbonation there was almost no carbonation ""bite"" in this for me, which helps cut through the thirst, ya know?",3.94

Look:
Chestnut brown that is difficult, but not quite impossible to see through. I can vaguely see my fingers through the glass, especially when I hold the mug up to a light. The beige/light tan head is initially 2+ fingers (it fills the remainder of the glass) but quickly dissolves to a ring and a very thin cover. The lacing is decent.

Smell:
Rich dark malts. Lightly toasted dark bread. Semi-sweet or even milk chocolate that is a hint dry (like a chocolate powder).

Taste:
Follows the nose. There is an earthy note here. Also some metallic notes that tell me that this beer is showing its age (its bottle date is 37 months ago). A light bitterness and tartness can be found in the background. Each sip finishes somewhat dry and slightly bitter or astringent.

Feel:
Soft with the aforementioned slightly astringent finish. Medium body.

Overall:
A pretty solid and good Dunkel. Easy to drink and would go well with food, especially German food. Unfortunately, this bottle is a tad old, and is starting to show its age. This beer is better than what my rating indicates. I will re-review and update my rating(s) when I get a fresher bottle.",3.84

Flavor: Strong flavors of toasted and roasted Munich malts giving flavors of dark breads, brown bread, black malt, some light tobacco notes, before a strong brown bread crust, sweet caramel malt finish. (4.25)

Aromas of orange juice open to peach creamsicle, meandering to a syrupy mango peak; resins edge the back end of the bouquet as vague tones of gritty, grassy subtext linger.

Taste highlights orange zest upfront, with an oncoming each/mango sorbet dominant in the face of toasty coconut cream undertones; a slightly dank, grassy edge comes through toward the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium-thick and sports a subtle prickle of carbonation phasing to taut yet creamy textures through the mid-palate, leaving a slight, residual grit lingering in contrast to glossier, semi-juicy resins into the finish.

Not my favorite King variant. Solid ipa but I am losing the base beer. Lots of tropical flavor but a pass for me. I think I would have been fine if they would have called this Tropical Storm or something but KJ has certain expectations.",3.57
Salvator,"Notes from 7/2/2022.
Poured from a bottle into a Rastal nucleated Teku glass.
The body is dark reddish-brown with almost a finger of beige head. Retention is average.
The intensity of aroma is medium-low. There are notes of mostly sweet malt, milk chocolate and caramel malt. I detect a slight hop aroma.
The intensity of taste is medium-high. Wow! That's good! The flavor has a deep malty, chocolaty, caramel flavor with a mild hop finish. It's sweeter than other Doppelbocks I've had.
The feel is thick, fairly creamy, the carbonation is medium-low, the astringency is medium-low giving it a long dry finish.
Overall, I prefer that it's sweeter which is more to my liking than Celebrator. Although, I consider Celebrator a obviously superior Doppelbock. I will probably purchase this one more often.",4.43

Salvator,"1.5 x 0.33L Bottles
Bottle Best By: 2022-aug
Glassware: 0.5 L Stange
Temp at Pour: 55.8 F / 13.2 C


Look:
Light and clear mahogany that leans to the red side. Initial 1-finger beige head that dissipates to a very thing coating. Some lacing, but not a lot.

Smell:
Sweet and malty. Dark fruits, toffee, and some lightly toasted caramel. Notes of honey and light brown sugar. A faint earthy tone can be detected.

Taste:
Definitely sweet, but not as sweet as the nose. Dark fruits and toasted caramel. Hints of nuts. There is an noticeable underlying earthiness that is lightly bitter. I also pick up faint hints of dry chocolate here and there.

Feel:
Smooth and slick. Somewhat syrupy. The body is on the full side of medium.

Overall:
A solid doppelbock that is on the sweet side. In some respects, it reminds me of an Old Ale.",3.73
Salvator,"Poured from a 11.2oz bottle into a pint glass. Most definitely an old bottle.

The look is a bit lighter than expected, a light brown to amber, with a very light haze. On the pour very little head formed, I am unsure why. What did form completely disappeared over a few minutes until zero head remained. Honestly a beer without any bubbles floating on top is a little offputting.

The aroma brings us back to normal here, although I can smell a bit of age, it's not skunked or anything, just perhaps more fermentation notes. Some caramel malts peek through. Perhaps even some dry fruit notes.

The taste follows the smell but much more malty. The fermentation flavor is there alongside the dry fruits. But right behind that is a malt explosion. It's not a very sweet beer and a wave of dryness and bitterness hit at the same time but it rounds out the beer well.

Feel is largely dry, but somehow it seems like a head forms nicely with each sip only in your mouth where you can't see it. I'm not sure what happened here exactly.

Overall a nice tasty doppelbock. Would be better fresh I'm sure but some beers are just hard to get fresh so that does factor into the score a bit. Malty as a Doppelbock should be.",3.77
Salvator,"Finally picked this up in a variety pack, always wanting to try more dopplebocks when I can as they are infrequently stocked here. This one drinks very light for its abv, a tad thin. Some decent flavors of sweet malty goodness. Going to enjoy all 4, but won't likely seek this out again if it required purchasing 8 other beers I'm not jazzed about. If sold separately, this is a pretty darn good dopplebock.",4.15
Salvator,"Pours a ruddy brown, hazy copper with a thigh two inch thick head that dissipates over a few minutes. Aromas are mild but pleasant, mostly sweet malt, caramel, a little bit nutty. I only get very mild fruity notes myself.

Interesting and straightforward, but subtle and complex tastes. The thing that distinguishes this from other Doppelbocks I’ve had is a bit of this savouriness in the middle. It’s a little funky in spots like a lambic or saison, and a little sweet, nutty and savoury like a thick bodied very sweet beer. Almost a cheesy like thickness and aftertaste. I’ve tasted this in a few other German beers so I’m not sure what it is. I’m still new to all this, so I’m sure I’ll discover it as I go on, but for now I just don’t know what it is.

Malt forward with mild bitterness, very doughy, yeasty flavours that are particularly sweet. Roasted caramel malt notes abound, and strong toffee. No fusel alcohol notes here. There is a very mild dried fruit flavour of dried raisins and figs. Not as strong as Aventinus (regular or Eisbock) which particularly features these types of fruity notes. In comparison to that and other doppelbocks, Salvator is more sweet, sticky, and sticks to the bready desserts. I do notice some enjoyable banana flavour here as well, especially as it warms. As with many complex beers, a lot of notes are strengthened by it warming up, particularly the dark fruit notes.

Very much medium bodied, slightly on the heavier side, the feel is thick and creamy, and just a tad oily. Feels like you can chew on the doughy malt. Mildly carbonated, which really allows the flavours to rest on your palate, giving it a nice long evolution of tastes with a lasting finish. Very creamy sip, it gently foams on the back of your tongue on the way down. As I noted above, the alcohol/abv% is not noticeable.

Paulaner brews are definitely ones that pick styles and a few good flavours and aim to hit the bullseye on them. So they’re not as complex as some others out there, but excellent benchmarks of whatever style they choose to brew. Salvator is a very interesting Doppelbock. If your favourite thing in the world is sweet, malty beers, your rating will likely be higher than mine. If you like more hop notes, or bocks that are mostly fruity, more dry and less sweet, you will likely rank this lower.

Salvator has a lot of great flavours that are melded together quite well, subtly complex, with a unique sweet savouriness. This makes it feel less clean and crisp than the slightly more boozy, less sweet, more dry examples of doppelbocks. But what it doesn’t have in those arenas, it makes up for in its creamy, less biting drinkability, malty sweet tastiness.",4.09
Salvator,"Picked this up over the holidays at Gary's in Wayne, as I hadn't had anything from Paulaner in years. Love their beers and the ability to get them in these parts, and this was a great example of a Doppelbock as it was true to form, well-rounded, and easy to drink. In other words, it was fitting on a chilly winter's night such as this!

This had a lovely, almond hue to it with a frothy and full tan head that settled beautifully and evenly. Loads of bread, caramel, and chocolate in the nose as the taste contained some plum and fig along with a bit of toffee, dark nuts, and apple. Slick, moderately cloying, and nicely carbonated, this felt great on the palate as it went down nicely with a hidden alcoholic presence. Smoke, banana, and raisins lingered in the aftertaste as the warmth settled in once I finished this off.

Loved this beer and it's underlying potency as it was plenty strong but wasn't overt in it's heft. Without even realizing it, the ""Enjoy best before"" date on the corner of the label was 2/22 as this tasted great and held up well since it's bottling. The complexity of this emerged as it warmed up as this has me wanting more examples of the style - most of which would not measure up to a benchmark such as this.",4.04
Salvator,"Personal notes only: Needn't buy again. Has a bit of that Lambic Ale flavor I don't care for. Maybe it's the higher alcohol. Very caramel malty, but there are a lot of other options.",3.5
Salvator,"Pours a dark red/copper colour. Nice thick frothy white head that sticks around noticably long.

Smells like chocolate,caramel, toasty, and definitely really sweet. Can't tell if the sweetness is from the chocolate smell or if there is something else there, almost fruity sweetness.

Taste is great. The caramel really comes out along with the dark chocolate, has a toasty and spiciness too it as well. It hides the high ABV extremely well. If someone told me this was 5% I would believe them.

This is my first doppelbock and I must say, I'm extremely impressed. Hits all the notes I wanted it to, some sweet, some toast, medium bodied, very drinkable. Delicious.",3.96
Salvator,"11.2oz stubby bottle

Smells like alcoholic cocoa puffs. Taste is hearty, like I'm drinking a dissolved coffee table, but surprisingly drinkable. Creamy and slightly slick with oil, it drinks heavy, warming you with a slight burn in your belly

Leffe Brune / Brown,"LOOK: Pours a deep mahogany brown with an outstanding tan head that maintains good retention and plenty of side glass lace.

Leffe Brune / Brown,"Pours a dark mahogany with rich cherry accents, huge 4"" fluffy tan head with exceptional retention and lacing. Nose is roasted malt, light smoke, charred wood, a caramel. Taste is interesting with notes of caramel, baking soda, raisin, and a small amount of raw sugar on the finish. Bit of warming alcohol lingers after the finish. Mouthfeel is ultra soft and smooth with only a hint of carbonation. Overall a nice, drinkable beer, though the sugary finish is a little off-putting.",3.7
Leffe Brune / Brown,"I had this beer with some excellent mussels in Arlington, VA. Surprised this was my first opportunity to review it.

The beer was poured from a bottle into a shaker pint glass. Dark clear brown color with a nice creamy beige head and great curtain lacing. Smell and taste of dark fruit and caramel. Apricots and dates with a nice malty background. Very tasty and excellent with the food.",4.23
Leffe Brune / Brown,"Pours a nice dark mahogany brown with a half finger of dense foam that quickly returns into a spotty cap

Strong yeasty and caramel malt notes are forward on the nose, mildly toasty. Figs and raisins, dried dark fruit. Bananas as well as spices such as clove and allspice.

Taste follows the nose pretty well. The yeasty notes are lightly doughy, pleasantly toasty caramel malt, the lower abv% (in comparison to other strong dark Belgian ales) gives it less of a rum/alcohol tinged inflection on the notes, which does let the lightly peppery and spicy esters and fruits have more of a fresh character. Mild bananas, banana bread, cloves, maybe even bakers chocolate, and plums and fresh figs.

Medium-light bodied, moderate carbonation, gently tickles the sides of the mouth and tongue. Average length finish that tends to the dryer side, relatively sweet, the spicy yeasty and bready notes most relevant on the finish.

Leffe is the slightly cheaper, super available popular Belgian ale you can find everywhere. It’s an excellent dip into these kinds of beers. Hard for me to ever dislike any kind of beer that is malty and yeast forward. Question is, how to judge this beer? Against all others in the Belgian category, or against beers in general? These notes are practically explosive compared to macro brews, likely to blow your mind the first time you pick up this 6 pack instead of Bud. But it’s a little light and mild in flavour profile compared to other dark strong ales from Belgium. Overall, it’s quite a fine beer, balanced, not overtly complex but it’s very crisp and enjoyable.",3.99

Leffe Brune / Brown,"Pours a deep, dark mahogany coloration with a large, creamy, lasting head.

Finishes with a medium sweetness and some caramel malt and estery fruit and spice lingering in the aftertaste. Smooth mouthfeel with a medium body and carbonation.

I think it's interesting how this basically tastes exactly like Leffe Blonde with darker malts. The general flavor profile really is incredibly similar here, with the yeast profile being very recognizeable, just with more bready, slightly toasted malts and hints of chocolate. I still like it a lot better than the Blonde though, because those dark malts really make a difference here.",3.77

First up I notice it's carbonated, then sweet, feels slightly syrupy on the tongue. Tastes of sugar with fairly subtle hops gradually asserting themselves to some sort of Kendal mint cake effect. Definitely a sipper and this is a 750ml bottle, so it lasts a matter of hours.",3.77
Leffe Brune / Brown,"My first beer of this style. Poured from a 11.2 oz bottle into a Chimay goblet. This beer has a brown dense color with a big frothy off-white head. Head retention is excellent and there is lots of filmy lacing on the sides of the goblet. Aroma is sweet caramel malt and some Belgian yeast. The taste is similar but also includes a bit of dark fruit (plums figs etc.) The flavor is somewhat complex and very inviting. Mouthfeel is rich, malty and smooth. A very easy-drinking beer. I would gladly try this one again.",3.94
Leffe Brune / Brown,"Bottle dated 10/09/22. IDK if that is Oct 9 or Sep 10. Never mind …

The aroma is a bit subdued. Spicy. Peppery. Clove. A bit of a banana bread aroma.

The beer is dark from the front, clear ruby with a back-light, with ample small bubbles of carbonation. It is topped with a thick, tan-to-off-white, head with excellent retention. Thick lacing remains on the opposite side of the chalice as I take a sip.

The taste is much richer than the subtle aroma would lead you to expect. Rich and malty. Banana bread, toffee, pepper and clove. Sweet caramel controlled by the spicy, slightly bitter middle and finish, resulting in a finish on the sweet side. While it would be classified by me as a sweet beer, that is overstating. It is nicely balanced and enjoyable.

The mouth feel is smooth with a creamy remainder on the tongue and throat, broken up by the carbonation.

Overall, quite delightful.",4.13
Leffe Brune / Brown,"Poured into a wide fluted glass similar to the Leffe Branded glassware. The beer pours a dark brown that is slightly translucent when held up to the light. The head that forms is fluffy off white/brown. It settles to a cap that leaves a nice lace as the glass empties. The smell is light but full of dried fruit and a hint of booze. The taste follows the smell, rich with dried fruit and little warming booze. The feel is good, and the carbonation is just right. The mouthfeel is a little slick, but not in a bad way. Overall, I like this beer. I only bought a single for a tasting, but would gladly purchase a 6 or 12 in the future. I think the big beer connection and easy availability works against this very good beer's ratings (I wrote the last sentence before I posted my review and saw that I gave Leffe Brune a slightly lower than than average rating, oh well).",3.77
Leffe Brune / Brown,"Sampling a cellar temp 11.2 fl oz bottle poured into my snifter. Freshest before 10/09/2022 on the label. Cheers to a clear date code that I dont need a ring, black light, calculator to figure out!
the beer pours a clear mahogany color with rich ruby highlights on the sides of the glass when held to the light. Several active streams of carbonation rise to the surface. A large pillowy khaki colored head of 4.5 cm foams up even with a very gentle pour. This foam recedes slowly and leaves some dense lattice as I swirl the glass. the foam never fully fades and is a very sturdy surface covering throughout.
Aroma is malt forward with some toffee and a bit of brown sugar, but also a rich dose of cloves and other spice notes. Maybe cinnamon mixed in there. No hop presence and the nose is appealing to me.
First sip reveals a medium body with soft tingly carbonation. Texture is a little slick and the beer drinks easy.
Flavor starts with a bit of caramel which then rolls to spicy yeast character. I get cloves again but here anice flavor comes through, which was undetected on the nose. No hop presence again and the booze is well hidden. This is a nice approachable beer with a good amount of complexity in its yeast profile, without being over the top.

Looks splendid in the glass. Deep, deep auburn colored body. Decent off white head persists in good form throughout, leaving scattered lacing

Kind of a caramel aroma without the sweetness.

On tasting, sweeter than the nose would suggest. The balance is a little more bitter than roasty.

Mouth between medium and full, finish a light to medium bitter roast.

Overall, an okay beer. Appreciate the effort at balance. Haven't had many Belgian brown ales, this was just okay.",3.78
Nectarous - Banana,"16 oz can.

Pours a hazy pale gold color with a large, very effervescent white head. The head has pretty good retention. Leaves some splotchy lacing.

The aroma brings notes of tangerine, grapefruit, and orange juice. There's some very faint banana lingering in the back.

The flavor has a lot of zesty citrus, bubblegum yeast, and the absolute foggiest idea of banana. Like someone dropped a banana near the tank but not actually in it. Disappointing.

The feel is typical Tree House. Creamy and very soft. Surprisingly dry on the finish.

Overall, this is a good NEIPA, but also a disappointing one. There's, at least according to the can, banana puree in this beer? Could have fooled me. I probably wouldn't even pick up that flavor in a blind taste test. Sometimes added fruits can overpower the base beer, but in this case, it's like they forgot to actually put the fruit in that they advertised on the can.",3.58
Nectarous - Banana,"Hazy yellow brown gold, very fluffy white head, pretty good lacing on the glass. Smell is fruity, creamy, green banana. There's a dryness to the smell that I wasn't expecting. Taste is tropical fruits with a backbone of banana bread if you made the banana bread with fully green bananas, it has that dry banana almost bitter feel to it... like a plantain chip. Honestly, I wouldn't have bought this if it hadn't come in a mix pack, but I'm not disappointed. It's an interesting rif on their usual flavors to me.",4.09
Nectarous - Banana,"Pours ultra hazy, pale gold in color with one quarter inch head. Taste is big citrus, tangerine and light banana. Medium body and carbonation, bitter.

Taste follows the aroma well. Lots of toasted bread, slight green apple, lightly caramel iced brown sugar without getting sweet, plum, earthiness and slight floral from the hops.

Medium body. Appearance made this look a little under-carbonated, but it drinks just fine. Slightly crisp, slightly soft, slick, and slightly gritty on the finish. Smooth and quite drinkable.

Pours a clear, deep copper body capped with two fingers of dense, fluffy, off-white foam; great head retention recedes slowly to a thin veil of semi-creamy cap, a slight, frothy collar, and a temporary array of large, splotchy lacing around the walls of the glass.

Aromas of fresh green apple dominate upfront, with a caramel malt undertone steadily combating the fruitiness; heartier undertones of brown sugar and burnt toast nod toward the otherwise slighted roaster notes as hints of prune give a brightness to the close.

Taste shows a lighter green apple presence against balancing caramel malts mirroring the bouquet; a touch of brown bread, root beer, and brown sugar form over the mid-palate before inviting a light, grassy undertone into the finish.

Mouthfeel brings a light-medium body alongside a moderate carbonation fizzing out into the mid-palate, where a semi-dry/crisp texture develops into a more rounded, oily malt character on the back end; the finish brings a distant heft and even grit with a refreshing peak into the swallow.

A genuinely eccentric and untraditional Märzen that, against all odds, comes together fairly well; prominent apple tones blend steadily with an unexpectedly subdued malt profile for a sweeter take on the style with a distinctly autumnal overtone.

Octoberfest Beer,"Honestly a little disappointing to me. It looks nice with a good amber color and nice bottle, smells like a good Märzen, but honestly wasn't as tasty as I was hoping. I don't know what it is. It has a simple hearty malt and bready flavor, but but it also has this kind of has this gross almost watered down bottom of the barrel cheap American beer side to it too. Almost like someone took a Märzen and mixed it with a Bud Light. I don't know if it's me, but just that particular six pack got like to warm and in the sun at one point, but it was off. Not entirely gross, just not as good as I was hoping with some gross notes.",3.63
Octoberfest Beer,"This is a 12oz. bottle poured into the Bell's pint glass. The brew is a nice dark looking amber, just a thin cap of tan foam, this beer is clear with light carbonation.
What this marzen lacks in appearance, it makes up in aroma. From the time the cap was popped there has been a pleasant malt, fresh biscuit aroma, slightly sweet.
The flavor is mighty fine also, following the aroma perfectly. The mal is up front, sweet fresh biscuits, caramel, finishing with a nice light bitter touch of hops, with a touch of pepper spice.
The mouthfeel is slightly creamy, the carbonation does not much to the feel.
This one is all over the rating map, it lacks a bit on appearance, smells great, tastes like a marzen, but misses on the nice creamy feel. This is very good but not great.",3.86
Octoberfest Beer,"Look: Hazy orange. One finger of white head that immediately dissipates.

Smell: Sweet malt, spicy and slightly metallic hops.

Taste: Biscuity malt, a little metallic and citrusy hops, sweet and crisp finish with lingering bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Average body, high carbonation.

Overall: A mild, drinkable, unspectacular fall beer.",3.69
Octoberfest Beer,"Poured into a pint glass, producing a pure white head that slowly dissipated into a thin film with nice clinging. Body is an amber gold. Nose is typical of marzen beers...light notes of bread, malts and very light caramel. Taste is better than most domestic marzens I have tried, maltiness with a touch of sweetness and a slight hop presence. The feel/ body has a little more weight to it than some others of this style, which I really liked. Overall, a nice Oktoberfest that I will buy again",3.84
Octoberfest Beer,"This is a good one! Poured from 12-ounce bottle into a vintage hollow-stemmed goblet. Clear golden copper color, with a finger of white head that settled rather quickly. Medium bodied, good carbonation (enhanced by nucleation points etched into the bottom of the stem), plenty of malty goodness without being overly sweet, and a finish that is slightly astringent with an understated hop bite and a little tart apple lingering on the palate. I'm no expert, but this is what I look for in an Oktoberfest beer. Don't forget the brats and sauerkraut!",4.37
Octoberfest Beer,"12 oz bottle, poured into a willi becher at ~40 degrees F.

L: Pours a crystal clear honey-amber, and forms a thin layer of white head that vanishes relatively swiftly.

S: Toast, bread, and caramel, with a hint of something not unlike damp fallen leaves.

T: There's definitely toast and caramel present, starting right from the jump. A vaguely medicinal tone emerges midway through the sip, and the aforementioned wet fallen leaves from the nose are also there. Something of a tea-like quality appears as well.

F: Medium of body, and quite lively.

O: A solid marzen, if not particularly spectacular. The medicinal note detracts a bit for me.",3.05
Octoberfest Beer,"Drinking this about half way through my yearly sampling of all things O'fest related and, while not blown away, neither is it a drain pour. Sports a clear amber appearance with a small white head and light lacing. Subtle toasted malt aroma and if you stick your proboscis deep enough into the glass there is some faint herbal hoppiness. Notched some sweetness early on in the taste but that faded away while the softer malts remained the focus. Hops played a minor supporting role. So what's the average rating for a marzen style O'fest? Didn't look it up but think this one should be right about there.",3.69
Octoberfest Beer,"Sampling a cold 12 oz bottle poured into a .5L dimple mug.
The beer pours a clear copper to almost golden color. Lighter color than I anticipated. A thin eggshell white head foams up, maybe .5 cm. This foam fades to nothing pretty quickly.
Aroma is lots of toasted grain and even a little nuttiness. Not any caramel notes here and hops are kinda absent too. I hesitate to say the nose is one dimensional, but it sort of is. Not a bad nose, just not complex.
First sip reveals a light to medium body with fine, gentle carbonation and a very smooth texture. Beer drinks very easy for physical traits.
Flavor is similar to nose, lots of toasted malt and grainy flavor. There is a little bit of nutty flavor and here, the faintest wisp of caramel. Only the faintest hop presence on the finish. Sort of a black tea note. No hint of ABV.
A drinkable tasty brew, that is good for what it features. Tasting events really call attention to differences in examples. Id try others again before this one.",3.83
Octoberfest Beer,"Growler into pint glass. Pours a clear deep copper-gold with a fine white head. Good lacing. Initial impression is toast, honey and a very subtle spiciness.

Octoberfest Beer,"Canned 7/20/21

Bell’s is honestly not a brewery that impresses me all that much. Everyone seems to love them but nothing I’ve had has felt much better than average. Anyhow, we keep on trucking through this tasting event, with yet another beer coming from Half Time’s mixed 12 pack. Let’s see what it’s all about

Pours a cloudy orange gold with 2 fingers of white head that fades to a thin cap and leaves minimal lacing

This is yet another one of these that trends quite sweet in the nose. I’m picking up on aromas of caramel malt, rich honey, orange rind, cracker, and earthy hops

In taste, this shows promise early on, but loses the plot a bit after the swallow. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting herbal hops, caramel malt, toasted brown bread, and light pepper. The swallow brings notes of sticky honey, toffee, caramel malt, golden raisin, and a touch of vanilla

A medium body pairs with moderate tingling carbonation, resulting in a crisp yet slick beer. Finishes a touch sticky but still refreshing

This one was also not that great. I don’t know what it is lately, but some of these just haven’t been impressing me. Oh well",3.64
Octoberfest Beer,"The first impression is everything; it's a Marzen with all the soft creamy mouthfeel you expect and caramel, muffin, bread, but also distinctly light and crushable, as I expect a festbier to be. As it is lower abv and lower body than expected, it does let up on the gas, and the profile goes from start to finish pretty quickly, lingering flavors is lightly lemon, barely herbal. Really one to crush en masse, won't slow you down.",3.89
Octoberfest Beer,"2021:

Appearance: Appearance: Pours a deep fiery orange, amber color with a creamy, white head that is lattice, lacy, and clinging to the sides of the glass. SRM of 10-11. The color looks very similar to the label on the bottle which is interesting (4.25)

Aroma: Mild aromas upfront of breadcrumbs, brown bread, toasty malts, with a bready finish. Hints of herbs. (3.75)

Flavor: Mild to moderate flavors of pale malts, bread dough, bread malts. Toasty, but then overall finishes balanced and smooth. Mild. (3.50)

Feel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Bready and creamy, finishes smooth. (3.75)

Compared to Surly Oktoberfest 9/6/21: Pours a slightly darker color. More bread crumbs, toasty malts on the aroma. Less lemonflower and honey.

Compared to Great Lakes Oktoberfest 9/24/21: Pours a lighter color. Similar aromas. More toasty and balanced. Less rich caramel and cherry sweetness.

Overall: I found this one to be slightly better than 2020. It has a nice toasty malt profile and drinks fairly smooth. Nothing spectacular and lacking hops, but the malt flavors are on point.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2020:

Appearance: Pours a deep, broze orange color with a creamy, milky off-white head that clings to the side of the glass. SRM of 14 (4.25)

Aroma: Mild aromas here. Mostly toasted bread with only hints of caramel and even less cinnamon. Mildly bready. A light touch of tropical orange underneath. Faint bread mostly, but it's there. It get's breadier as it warms. (3.25)

Flavor: Flavor follows with mild flavors. Bready and creamy. A rubbery yeast in the middle, before it finishes with more bread and cream. Slightly earthy, but not really. Finishes bready and smooth with a bit of cream. Mild, nicely subtle, but underwhelming. (3.50)

Feel: Bready, full, and creamy. Medium-carbonation and creamy. Finishes full. (4.00)

Compared to Sierra Nevada's Oktoberfest 2020 8/30/20: Pours a slightly darker color. Milder aromas. Less orange and pine soap. More bready overall, but milder.

Overall: Like last year this is a milder version of an Oktoberfest Marzen. The It is bready, creamy, and smooth. Could use more spice as it is quite simple and fails to define itself a flavor. Mildly bready, but it's there. Not bad, but I want a bit more here. (Final Rating: 3.68)

2019:
Appearance: Pours a deep fiery orange, amber color with a creamy, white head that is lattice, lacy, and clinging to the sides of the glass. SRM of 14. The color looks very similar to the label on the bottle which is interesting (4.25)

Aroma: Aromas of lemon, honey, and lots of corn. Very much like an adjunct lager or cream ale. A touch of grass but no breaded malts like I would expect. (3.25)

Flavor: Flavors follows the nose well with lemonflower, honeysuckle. Drinks like a cheap American or Czech-style pilsner. Slight bread but no toasted flavors at all. Finishes relatively dry. (2.50)

Feel: Medium-bodied for the style. Creamy and low to moderate carbonation. (3.50)

Overall: This is a let down of an Oktoberfest as some others have mentioned. Drinks like a slightly heavier, cheap American lager. Could also be mistaken for a blonde or cream ale. Not an Oktoberfest or Marzen. It malts taste like cheap adjunct malt flavors. Very simple beer. Maybe a cheap Vienna lager at best. I don't really know what there is here to appreciate. (2.99)",3.68

25th Anniversary Ale,"This beer looks great, the first sip was damn near immaculate, it tasted like the cinnamon gum drops but with a more intricate spice blend. However after that I've never gotten it again. This would be a solid Belgian style Christmas brew though regardless",4.0
25th Anniversary Ale,"Guess i'll just be lazy and award it a straight 4 all across the boards. Pour is lovely, a ruddy copper with a 2-finger off-white capper, quickly receding to a thin gurgle on the surface and perimeter. Nose of citrus and floral notes, a little booze to burn the nose hairs. Taste is bittersweet, notes of grapefruit and overripe mangos. Not a bad melange, but the bitter hops are quite dominant (almost IPA-ish?). Swallow & aftertaste the same bittersweet, more the former than the latter.

Nice to try, but i doubt i'll be slobberin' to grab up any more than this 4-pack.",4.0
25th Anniversary Ale,"Built like a dubbel ale but scaled like a darker and stronger Belgian ale, the brewery of Ommegang is settling into their mid twenties with a clever spiced ale that's deeply rooted in tradition.

Pouring a rusty and ruddy reddish brown before building a slight sepia stained froth, their 25th Anniversary Ale leads with a sultry scent of brown sugar, dark fruit, bright spices and a tingle of spiced rum on the nose. Sweeter to taste, the malts lead the flavors with those brown sugar, cream caramel, toasty breads and savory molasses to suggest something of spice cake or coffee cake.

As the flavors roll along the middle palate, the fruit flavors spring forward with plum, red grape, date, fig and raisin. Hints of maraschino cherries keep the sweeter tone in focus while a balance of fresh cracked peppercorn, orange peel, paradise seed and coriander offset the fruit and sweetness while adding a brightness to the finish. A late drying trend allows for the taste of spiced rum to emerge with a warm red wine character.

Full bodied, creamy and nougat-like, the beer's bold stature closes with a warm brandy-like sensation but with a flavor profile that's friendly like abbey dubbel ales. Its a clever recipe with pristine brewing execution for a beer fitting for a quarter century celebration.",4.23

So I am glad to celebrate Ommegang's 25th anniversary and their 19th anniversary together as the North American crafters' wedge to bring the Belgian tradition to this side of the pond. This is an appropriate brew to commemorate their great success.

I just bought a 4-pack in a beer run to Woodman's in Kenosha Wisconsin. And I'm glad I did.
My first bottle tells me that this Grains of Paradise makes a powerful malt; spicier than any grain I'm familiar with other than rye. Of course, that much spice means that the brewer needs to be skilled. And of course, Ommegang is.

I will give a more detailed review of the second bottle.",3.97

Whole wheat dough leads the flavors. It is dry up front with light sweetness and faint bitterness. Lots of toasted grain gives is a similar flavor to wheat thins, although without the sweetness. The finish is light and quick. It is sharp at first, then lingers to a whisper.

The creamy texture works well with the medium to light body. There is just a hint of alcohol, as expected. The carbonation is soft and, ultimately, this one is dry.

Copper Legend is a pleasant finish to the official Oktoberfest. This one is possibly the most enjoyable of the batch so far.

Taste is lovely and smooth as hell. It is malt heavy, which is right up my alley. You get a little reacharound from the hops which lends a little bite to the finish. Aftertaste is light and inoffensive. Finishes squeaky clean. Sessionable and very very drinkable. Approach with caution.",4.53

Smell: The aroma is malt-forward with a nice biscuity and bread crust character and prominent sweet munich malt. The aroma is almost creamy - I get some vanilla sweetness in there. There is also a nice floral hop character with a grassy, mildly peppery and bitter finish.

Taste: This is a very drinkable beer. It has a really nice maltiness up front, and the finish is very gentle - crisp, mildly bitter, barely spicy, and dry. It has this really nice sweet, grainy flavor character that reminds me a bit of a Bavarian pretzel.

Feel: It has a nice mouthfeel - it's medium bodied but I would say full bodied for a Marzen lager. Nicely carbonated.

Overall: This is the first time I have reviewed a Jack's Abby beer. I haven't had a lot of Oktoberfest beers, but it seems to me that this is a very traditional style of Marzen especially for an American beer.

Appearance – The beer is served a deep amber-orange color with a one finger head of fizzy white foam. The head fades rather fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the brew is heavy of a caramel and brown sugar smell mixed with a good showing of roast and toast. Along with these smells comes aromas of a light spice and some harvest fruit.
Taste – The taste starts with a breast and sweet taste of caramel and brown sugar. There is a good amount of roast upfront that ends up fading a bit as the taste advances. At the same time some apple and pear as well as a bit of spice develop as the taste moves forward, taking the taste to the end, and leaving a moderatly toasty and toasty, moderately sweet taste to linger on the tongue.

Poured into my personalized Jack's Abby Octoberfest 2021 stein. Rich copper with deep orange hues and a foamy white head. Toasty and bready in the nose with a touch of caramel. Incredibly smooth, soft, and creamy on the palate. Nose carries over to the tongue with more toasty and bready malts, caramel, toffee, graham cracker, and baked pie crust. Moderately sweet.

Cold Torpedo,"Why not try two brown twelve ounce bottles at once? The best way to do this is to empty both bottles into a clear glass liter mug. Here's another one that provides a stark white foam, rather than a proper IPA head. OK, it's far from the worst offender. The brew itself is a light golden amber and it's fairly translucent. There's a mild piney and earthy hop aroma to be had and there's almost no maltiness. The taste is disappointing. Although it's not lopsidedly out of balance between malt and hops, overall it's just lame. From their beginning, Sierra Nevada has offered decidedly hoppy beers with a good malt backing, way before most other American brewers. This has neither. The body is thin and the hops are bland and one dimensional. There's absolutely no hop taste transition that usually occurs in a good IPA. Those usually change from some sort of taste reference that is citrus, pine or fruit, into something either dry or bitter. It doesn't happen here. In a blind taste, this would be below average. Knowing that it came from this brewery, it's demoralizing. Mild demarcation by an otherwise scanty glass lacing can't salvage this one.",3.62

For the most part their beers are above the industry standard and I have enjoyed their beers for many years now. Having said that, this Cold Torpedo beer does NOT live up to their reputation. The appearance once again is very well done, although the aroma of hops is present is is very weak and seems one dimensional and that follows through with the taste, I very much wish it had been much stronger as the taste/aroma of regular Torpedo brings across. Granted, with all the competition and styles and etc., etc. going on in the market today breweries are trying this that and the other thing to increase or even maintain their piece of the pie, this beer fails to meet SN's standards, but I did drink it all while typing this so its not a bad beer by any stretch, just not up to SN's standards.",3.68

Overall the incredible mouthfeel and above average taste more than make up for the lackluster appearance and smell. It’s a good filler for a mix pack but I wouldn’t buy a case of it when the regular torpedo or SNPA is available. Still, worth a try!",4.04
Cold Torpedo,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter glass and from a mix-o-pack. The beer pours a light golden in color with a hint of haze. Bit of wheat 'green' look to it though not sure what the malt bill looks like. Light cap drops some lace and regenerates with a spin. Firmly carbonated.

Aroma is clean and spicy/peppery with some subtle tropical fruit notes. Expands a bit with warming.

Taste is lightly bready with a touch of fruit and finishes with a flash of bitterness which also expands a bit with warming. Overall the jury is still out. My first Cold IPA and not sure where it fits in my universe. Agree with others that the use of the word Torpedo is a bit misleading, beer vs. machine. Still, an easy quaff at 7 percent.",3.59
Cold Torpedo,"From the Sierra Nevada blog: ""We brew our Cold IPA using lager yeast, fermented warmer than usual, to give Cold Torpedo its light and clean backbone. That temperature bump helps reduce the sulfur-like notes that lager yeast can create when kept at its normal range of 42–55 ºF."" I guess this temperature bump is the argument to give this style it's own name, but this is not an ale! I would call this an India Pale Lager, which I am a big fan of.

This 12 oz bottle was from a 12 pack mix I picked up at the grocery store and is dated 06/03/22, then consumed on 08/17/22. I have to rate the look lower because they are labeling this as an ale when it's actually a lager, but it has that traditional golden color a lager would have. The smell is fairly mild, a subtle but funky piney aroma. The taste has a light malt flavor, followed by a well balanced bitter aftertaste. The feel is crisp and light, good level of carbonation.

Overall, I actually love this beer, but I hate the name. This is a biased review because I am a fan of hoppy lagers and Sierra Nevada, but I am disappointed in the name choice. It doesn't taste anything like their Torpedo Extra IPA, or any ale for that matter. Probably a bad marketing decision, but at least it tastes good!",4.25
Cold Torpedo,"Packaged 03/31/22 -- from the SN Hoppy Sampler Pack. Poured into my Libbey Imperial Pint.

How to rate a ""Cold"" IPA? As an American IPA? Dunno.

L -- Clear, pale gold with a tall, dense white head that leaves good lacing.

S -- Citrus and stone fruit nose with a touch of alcohol. Light white bread aroma back and DMS in the ""fresh"" form. Pretty light all around.

T -- Citrus fruits and spicy, bitter hops up front. Alcohol hotness and a light breadiness back. Fruit esters in the finish and into the after taste, but after taste is more hot, peppery alcohol with spicy, bitter hops dominant -- even a touch solvent.

M -- Mouthfeel is dry and crisp with a light-medium body.

O -- This brings to mind hoppy malt liquor. Something about the light malt and hot alcohol character reminds me of strong U.K. lagers -- with fruity and spicy hop accents. Probably couldn't drink more than one or two.",3.39
Cold Torpedo,"Pours a clear bright yellow color, fairly nondescript aroma. Meh, a bit thin in flavor and mouthfeel. Bitter as expected, but not really balanced.

Cold Torpedo,"Bottled 3/31/22 from a Publix supermarket.

Pour: Golden clear with a touch of haze but not enough to hinder seeing through the beer. Beautiful white head of foam.

Smell: Like a fruit filled garden that a semi truck full of hops just crashed into. Its beautiful with a hint of lager? Loving it.

Taste: When that hop filled truck crashed crushing that fruit garden the juices ran into a bottle. That bottle was poured into this beer during brewing. Its so drinkable that it would surprise the most snobbiest of beer drinkers.

A+ love it!",4.4
Cold Torpedo,"A very good beer but a little dishonest with the marketing. If you look at the Sierra Nevada website you can clearly tell that this beer is not an IPA. In fact this beer is not even an ale. It is fermented with lager yeast. It tastes like an IPL or a stronger pilsner. Delicious hoppy flavors and a crisp refreshing lager feel/body. I guess they wanted to capitalize on the allure of the ""IPA"" marketing label. This beer is 100% hoppy lager and I love it.",5.0
Cold Torpedo,"COld 12 oz. bottle poured into stange glass. dated from june, so pretty fresh by local (sub)standards. Looks nice, light golden and fairly clear, with a nice white head that has longevity. Aroma is faint but pleasant. My sniffer is toasted from nose hits. Taste is very good. Very nicely balanced, lager-like ale that is hiding the 7%abv, and very drinkable. Nice clean and dry finish. One of the best ""new"" ipa's lately. Just grabbed the hoppy mix box of 12 ipa's because of the good deal on it, and it's always a safe bet when trying a new Sierra Nevada. Even if you don't like it, you know it was well made. I think this could convert my lager only friends into ipa territory. Recommended",4.25
Cold Torpedo,"Went ahead and bought the variety 12 pack, because hey, 3 of the beers in there are the greatest ale of all time. Easy to take a chance on a new beer when they package it up with the gold standard (SNPA).

This pours noticeably lighter colored SRM than OG Torpedo. This is straight up yellow. 1/2"" white head. Not the best clarity I've seen from Sierra Nevada (below average for them). The hops seem to be similar to regulare Torpedo, that is, for bittering. I think they stuck w the hop bill, something Magnum, maybe Simcoe and C hop(s).

The taste is basically a less malty, less caramel like Torpedo. It does have a crisper snap to the mouth feel. Ample bitterness. Lots of pine if you have never had Torpedo. Some grapefruit rind.",3.73
Cold Torpedo,"PKGD: 4/20/22 opened and reviewed on 7/13/22

Look: A totally clear.. (did I just say clear??) Gold color. Light, white foam cap covers well and sticks around a bit too.

Nose: slight pine and pineapple, zingy citrus and sweet, spicy golden malt. Subtle, yet interesting aromatics.

Feel & Flavor: A long and slick malty feel, pretty clean overall with an excellent straight ale flavor to balance out the zesty fruits and tanginess of the frigid fermentation. Zesty pineapple and peppery citrus notes are only outshined by the malt complexity.

Overall: I really like IPA'S that have a solid and clean malty backbone, especially when it's a golden malt. The ""Ale"" forward flavor's make it seriously drinkable for 7% and the hops are mid-level complexity at best but still stands as interesting.",3.79

Beer poured a clear gold with a beautiful white head that is leaving lacing behind.

Nose is floral hop forward.

Taste is a nice bready malt base infused with a light touch of Cascade giving a touch of citrus finishing with nice peppery hop bite leading to a crisp smooth and bitter finish; 7/10 on my scale.

Mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and refreshing.

Overall a nice effort from the brewing team, like the lager like vibe!",3.97
Cold Torpedo,"From the rear label: ""PKGD 03/31/22""

Appearance: The body is a medium gold color with a medium haze, making it difficult to see through the glass but items are clearly identified. The head is short, white, and creamy textured. It has good head retention and leaves nice sheets of dense bubbles on the glass.

Aroma: There is a light minty pine aroma that comes through at first, then a light bit of alcohol.

Taste: Pine hits the tongue first, then it picks up a touch of mint with a light candy sweetness. There is a bitter pine and a touch of grapefruit peel towards the middle of the mouth. It doesn't change towards the back of the palate or in the aftertaste. Mostly it has a minty pine character which is nice but also mellow.

Mouthfeel: It is very smooth with an almost slick consistency. It has a nice bitterness which is on the stronger side. It lingers on the palate with a smooth finish.

Overall: It is an interesting beer. The back label states that this ""DELIVERS THE FRUIT-FORWARD HOP RUSH YOU'RE AFTER"" however it seems more pine and mint focused, with only a touch of grapefruit. It also states that this ""FINISHES ULTRA CRISP AND CLEAN"" which it does not. It sticks to the palate and lingers. The beer is still good and I would recommend that people try it if they enjoy a lot of pine in their IPA's, but it seems to miss the brewer's intent. It is fairly one-note and has this smooth slickness which just feels odd when compared to the relatively high bitterness. I could still drink it again but I would probably buy regular Torpedo if given the choice.",3.38
Cold Torpedo,"12 ounce bottle poured in a tulip IPA glass.

Translucent gold color, no haze except for the condensation on the outside of the glass. White soapy cap, 1f, sticky lacing.

Caramel malt and citrus hop flavors. Orange, grapefruit peel, and herbal.

Medium bodied with a nice mix of malt smoothness and hop bitterness. Dry finish line.

It goes down easy. Its 7% abv is covered up. The hop flavors are mild, yet it’s bitter.",4.17
Cold Torpedo,"Bottled 04/08/22

Appearance - Pours with a light haze and is golden orange in color. White, half finger width head that dissipates rather quickly, leaving behind a thin, broken layer of suds with a thin, consistent ring hugging the edge of the glass. Sparse lacing, with a handful of small spots making a virtual sad face.

Smell - Floral hops and a juicy citrus aroma really stand out.

Taste - Follows the nose. Bright citrus, orange and tangerine, and floral hoppiness take the stage here, with a bready malt backbone and a kiss of caramel sweetness. Touch of grapefruit mid-taste. Finish displays a trace of pine and light citrus pith bitterness.

Mouthfeel - Light-to-medium in body with fair carbonation. Slick, smooth drinker before a lightly dry finish.

Overall - Really solid brew. Easier drinking than the standard Torpedo but hopheads would probably prefer the former. It's lighter, brighter profile certainly makes for a friendlier summer drinker. I would by more of this if it came in it's own sixer instead of only being able to get it in their 12 pack mixer.",4.03
Multiple Ectogasms,"Appearance: Pours a completely hazy (5% clarity) light and pale yellow color with a creamy looking body. A strong, creamy white head. SRM of 6. (4.50)

Aroma: Strong and dank aromas of tropical melon, berries, some nectarine with a dank foresty malt underneath. Slightly sweet aromas.

Flavor: Strong dank and juicy flavors of tangerine, dank berries, melon. Blackberries, blueberries. Some phenolic notes. A sweet finish. Dank, and somewhat bitter pine off the finish.

Feel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation. Finish is crisp and somewhat bitter.

Compared to Modist Midwest Mindset 8/29/22: Pours a lighter, hazier color. Milder aromas. More dank berry, melon, tangerine. Less citrus rind, flower, herbs, mango, pineapple. Sweeter, danker, and more hop burn.

Overall: Certainly showcases the DDH Mosaic here. Dank berries and melon. Some appreciable bitterness here, whether from the hops or the hop burn I am not sure. Sort of cleans the palate of the sweetness. A bit too bitter and hop burn for my liking, but the appearance is there and the body wants to be there, but consumed by hop burn and/or bitterness. (Rating: 4.07)",4.07
Multiple Ectogasms,"A: The beer is very hazy yellow in color - too hazy to see if there is any visible carbonation. It poured with a quarter finger high white head that quickly settled down, leaving just a narrow collar around the edge of the glass.

T: The taste has flavors of lime and lychee along with notes of mango. Little to no bitterness is perceptible.

Multiple Ectogasms,"Really enjoyed ectogasm and was excited to try this one, but found it to be a step too far. Starting with the feel, where the orignal was pillowy, smooth yet had a good hope finish, this one is broken up by the imbalance with the hops, making the body feel watery with jagged hop textures as the only diversity. This undermines the taste with the flavors besides hop bitterness, citrus pith and lemon being taken out of the equation almost immediately, but the hops are flavorful and full. Nose is all hops, airy and bitter with huge citrus and lighter melon tones. Looks great though, hazy bright yellow with a full white head and light lacing. Balance is just off here",3.83
Multiple Ectogasms,"Hazy lighter golden almost milkshake like look with a thin white head, this brew looks quite nice. An immediate almost orange juice like scent just jumps out of this can when cracked. Juicy and well balanced with a gentle lingering grapefruit juice like bitterness on the end.

Multiple Ectogasms,Pours a standard mimosa color with a smaller white head that dissipates after a minute.

Multiple Ectogasms,"16 oz can, was swayed by the salesman on this one.

Pours a milky smooth creamy pale blonde with a creamy head of 2 fingers, leaving tons of lace behind as it recedes to a thick ring.

In the aroma, Citra and Mosaic come forward with gooseberries and some slight cattiness. Some damp dirty laundry accompanies this somewhat, detracting from some of the cleaner hop aromas.

Flavor is not impressive at all and brings Arm & Hammer, grapefruit, lemon peel, soap, and slight popsickle stick. I checked the can again, and it does indeed say it's double-dry-hopped. Yet it tastes like some half-assed session beer. There is absolutely no way this is 7%. It's practically water.

Feel is juicy and creamy and acidic, on point. Good carbonation, moderate alcohol presence. But none of this matters because the flavor profile is non-existent.

Overall, no lie, this had to be the worst - or at least most boring - Citra/Mosaic IPA I've ever had. Did they brew this beer, cut it in half with carbonated water, and THEN release it?

Either I'm getting the turd out of every 4 pack or other people are smoking crack. Seriously - Drekker sucks, after half a dozen beers from them I have not found a single one worth finishing. This was laundry water. Expensive laundry water.

Oktoberfest Weissbier,"0.33 L bottle
Best By: April, 2022
Glassware: 0.5 L Weizen Vase
Temp at Pour: mid 40s F


Look:
Golden yellow that is hazy and somewhat opaque (I can see the shadows of my fingers through the glass). Initial 2-finger pillowy off-white head that fades quickly to a thick ring and inconsistent cover. A bit underwhelming for a Hefeweizen.

Smell:
Bananas and bubblegum with some citrus notes. Grainy wheat malt. Minimal spices

Taste:
Ripe bananas and sweet citrus notes with very noticeable wheat grains. Cloves and allspice come through towards the end along with some flowery notes. As the beer warms some tartness becomes evident.

Feel:
Smooth and somewhat creamy. Body leans to the lighter side of medium.

Overall:
An interesting beer. This is a grainer variant of a Hefeweizen that has a higher ABV than most others and more inline with Oktoberfest beers. Though unspectacular, it is inoffensive and hits the classic Hefeweizen notes. It is eminently drinkable. It would be a find beer to introduce someone to the Hefeweizen styles.",3.46
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"Gem clear and gold until the yeast floods in. A big, voluminous, white meringue fills the bulb of a Pretentious Glass Company weizen glass. The head slowly settles to a thin blanket, leaving spotty lace beyond a spool of hair-thin glass.

The aroma has a nice, doughy/banana bread quality. It does, however, become muddy, with dusty straw as the head settles. Warmth reveals the expected clove.

It is sweet, front to back, with faint bitterness building into and through the finish. The banana flavor is very muted, though present. This is definitely a wheat beer, however, I suspect it was not as fresh as I had hoped. The bottle says ""Best By April 2022"". I drank it in November of 2021.

The medium body and soft, Jersey cotton texture give it a fluffy sensation. Alcohol is light, as expected, however, the carbonation should not be light and fizzy as it is here.

Appearance – The beer pours a hazed orange color with a one finger head of puffy white foam. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a light level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma is big of a grainy and wheaty smell mixed with lots of orange and banana and spice of clove. Along with these smells comes a bit of toast and hay. Overall, very nice.
Taste – The taste begins with a sweeter wheaty and grainy taste with the sweeter being mostly of an orange and caramel taste. As the taste advances flavors of clove and coriander spice as well as banana comes to the flavor profile. At the same time a touch of herb and grass hit the tastebuds, all while a yeasty flavor comes in and some of the grain leaves, leaving one with a nice, somewhat sweeter but very pleasant weisbier flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the brew is medium in thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is slightly higher. Overall, the feel is great for the style and makes for a very nice easy drinker.

T: Definitely a hefeweizen. Clove, banana, and bubblegum hit right up front, and roll into the background by the finish to allow a biscuitlike bready quality to come forward.

F: Creamy and full, though with a bit of a lighter breakdown by the swallow.

O: Not a bad weissbier.",3.94
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"A wheat version of an Octoberfest style. Appearance is a golden cloudy color with banana, clove, taste. I find this more of a Hefeweizen than an Octoberfest and that is why it is categorized as a Hefeweizen, instead of an Octoberfest beer.",3.75
Oktoberfest Weissbier,"A- This pours out of the bottle, which I may say has great artwork and color, a cloudy golden hue, but only after some careful swirling of the 'nutrients' at the bottom of the bottle with a bit of the liquid, otherwise this would be a light yellowy golden color that is rather clear! The carbonation seems to be fairly aggressive in nature, and the head is white, and shows up as a small circular glob right in the middle of the glass at the top of the brew, with many columns of fizz bursting around it. There is modest lacing that graces the inside of my glass, but over time becomes more of an oily looking residue that doesn't stick at all. Overall this does have some characteristics of a Hefe, and looks decent enough.

S- The aromas are of medium banana bread, cloves, nutmeg, yeast, and sweet caramel malts. There are perhaps some muted grassy grainy wheat aromas, but definitely stay put in the background. I also detect some, again, muted hints of hop presence. Overall the smell is mild, which for a Hefe is probably not ideal, but for an Oktoberfest style, is great.....a blend of both styles here.....

T- Much of the aforementioned aromas carry over into the flavors. Muted banana, baking spices (clove and nutmeg), creamy yeast, bread and/or biscuit, and a dry finish that is of grain/wheat kernel. I find that the overall malt profile is fairly robust, and is noticeable from start to finish. I find that it is also reasonably clean on the finish. I like it!

M/O- As my eyes suggested, this one is definitely heavily carbonated, which is what I like to enjoy for an Oktoberfest. The body is medium and I find it to be highly drinkable (it helped that I found these 5 packs that came with a sweet glass for $13.99!) Think this does well with a meat pizza, as I had with this, as it cuts the oily pepperoni well, and it works well as a palate cleanser. An overall mild Hefe that doubles as a flavorful Oktoberfest....I can enjoy more than a pint in a sitting and see this as a great hot weather refresher!",4.07

Pours completely pitch black with a finger of creamy light tan head that fades to a ring and leaves minimal lacing

Oh man, this is very sweet and boozy in the nose. I don’t know why, but I was expecting something with more bite. Still, I like it. I’m picking up on aromas of toasted coconut, sweet vanilla, oak, chocolate fudge, molasses, brown sugar, light raisin, marzipan, and light rye

Likewise in taste it is quite sweet, without much punch to keep it truly balanced. On the front end of the sip I’m tasting molasses, sweet bourbon, toasted oak, honey, spicy rye, caramel, light coconut, black cherry, and brown sugar. The swallow brings notes of brown sugar, molasses, spicy rye, sweet bourbon, caramel, toasted coconut, oak, and milk chocolate

A full body pairs with gentle tingling carbonation, resulting in a boozy sweet beer. Finishes neutral with a bold sweetness

From the Revolution Stouts I’ve had, I’ve noticed that many lean more into Barleywine territory. I don’t mind that, but in this one it’s perhaps a bit too sweet. Still, it’s enjoyable other than the feel being hurt a bit",4.11

Phenomenal, just like batch one when fresh. Dark brown appearance with a good bit of foam forming upon aggressive pour. Smells and taste of plenty of chocolate, sweet bourbon and rice spices. This beer should be allowed to warm closer toward room temperature, as it really opens up on those notes then. Medium feel, which is great because it makes it approachable and not like you're eating dinner out of a bottle.

If batch 1 is any indication though, this should be drank on the fresher side and not 'aged'.",4.71
Thundertaker,"12 oz. can. Black, slightly transparent at the edges. Smells of bourbon, chocolate, brown sugar, stronf rye spice. Tastes of chocolate, booze, bourbon, oak, rye spice. Finishes with a lot of rye. Medium heavy, pretty sweet, quite boozy. Tasty, but excessively boozy, which makes it very tough to drink.",3.65
Thundertaker,"Thanks to Jinx989 for this 12 oz. can as I continue to try to cram as much Revolution Deep Woods stuff into my body as possible. More success!

The pour is coffee dark with a short, quick-moving head. The nose is hefty rye, bourbon, with a backboard of chocolate.

Thundertaker is a stout to be dissected; it’s like a beer layer cake. And it took a good 45 minutes to open up. I initially thought this was kind of dull. It’s not. Rye finally rises & the bourbon settles in right between my eyes. Behind is chocolate, loads of sweet molasses, brazen spiciness that leans towards mélange, with a touch of brown leather on the finish. Thick & spicy. I am going to hide the other can from my wife.

Not the mind-blowing rye I was seeking but this is bloody excellent.",4.15
Thundertaker,"Canned on 9/10/2020; consumed on 8/18/21

Pours a glossy, inky black body capped with over two fingers of soapy, pale mocha foam; great head retention leaves a quickly fading cap, a razor-thin, frothy collar, and no lacing whatsoever holding to the walls of the glass.

Aroma brings rye spice to the forefront as the malt profile expands upon big, fudgy chocolate tones into shaved almonds with a bourbon imbued epicenter imparting an undercurrent of oak and vanilla, while culminating in a chocolate pudding toast crescendo through the close.

Taste opens with burnt brownie crust as spikes of spicy rye malt form caramel brittle and vanilla-tinged fudge into the mid-palate, where decadent layers of melted dark chocolate and tinges of molasses being sensations of chocolate pudding crusts, while subtle bourbon and oak coat the increasingly decadent malt finish.

Mouthfeel offers a medium-full body with minimal carbonation, slick, semi-creamy textures evolving and glistening over the mid-palate to deliver a prickly warmth; trending toward a stickier characteristic which never quite materializes, instead highlighting a softer char into a subtle dryness on the back end.

Rich expression of malt decadence blatantly attempts to compensate for the immediate affront of rye spice, seeking a tenuous balance, occasional clashing, and ultimately settling well to satisfy both the sweeter tooth and barrel-forward leanings.",4.04
Thundertaker,"12 ounce can into a snifter. Canned 9/10/20, had 12/3/20.

Pours an opaque dark brown, thick looking, with a brief quarter inch head and light foamy lacing. Aromas of bourbon, rye, chocolate, malt, tobacco, oak, some char, molasses, some vanilla as it warms, light raisins and leather. Smells fantastic. The flavor is more bourbon forward and wow, is it good. Then rye, chocolate, malt, oak, tobacco, raisins, vanilla as it warms, light molasses, a little char. Has a definite spicy flavor. Tastes about as good as it smells. Silky smooth, a solid full body, well carbonated.

This is my favorite stout of the Deep Wood series, no doubt. Incredible barrels, a heavenly aroma, a cornucopia of aromas and flavors. The rye malt is a knockout, too. That extra five months in the barrel from the original planned release certainly did no harm. Revolution just continues to amaze.",4.64
Thundertaker,"Poured from a can, the beer pours the expected blackish brown color. Head retention and lacing aren't this beer's strong suit, but even so, the beer looks quite rich and viscous. When I first tasted this beer (fresh out of the fridge), I wasn't hugely impressed, as I picked up an overwhelming amount of molasses on the nose and palate. However, as the beer warmed and opened up, there was noticeable dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, light coffee and some light bourbon/rye whiskey. The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely in this rich, fairly sweet stout, with the beer displaying a soft, creamy, full mouthfeel. Not that it matters I think, but while I did pick up some rye on the nose, there wasn't much of that on the palate. Either way, I don't think the rye flavor adds a whole lot to this beer. Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the alcohol is up there a bit (I mean after all, the abv IS 14.6%). So this is definitely a sipper (I think I spent close to 3 hours savoring this beer, watching 3 episodes of star trek voyager).

This is the first beer I've had from this brewery, and to say the least I was quite impressed. This is very well done.",4.46
Thundertaker,"Deep near-obsidian almost-black. Oily. Small head fizzes up fizzes down and is gone.

Nose is more subdued than I'd expect, to be honest. Dark roasted malts, burnt coffee, dark dark chocolate... boozy, but not as much as you'd expect given it's massive ABV. Enjoyable flavours, but relatively muted.

Oily and spicy with spicy carbonation. Warm alcohol finish. Again, definitely very very boozy, but not as much so as 14.6% might suggest.

Sweet first off. Rich and oily. Dark plum, fudgy dark dark chocolate brownies, some espresso bitterness to go with the chocolate bitterness. Sweet, oily, rich, decadent. Less of the hard spicy rye than I got on the nose.

Another decadent IL-area stout from @FBarber's box of goodies. Thanks Frank!",4.13
Thundertaker,"This was fantastic from beginning to end. Look was above average, smell was above average with lots of bourbon, but the taste was where the magic really happened. I got lots of barrel char in this to accompany the rye spice, deeply layered malts, and sweet bourbon finish. Smooth as silk with a touch of alcohol burn.",4.53
Thundertaker,"Obsidian black with a short dark mocha head that fizzles out fairly quickly to a thin brown caviar chain, leaving a surface that appears somewhat oily and gloppy. A tilt will develop solid legs fully sweeping around the perimeter of the glass.

Delectable aromas of charred oak and dark chocolate give way to hints of toasted marshmallow and fainter hints of hickory smoked almond.

While a little lighter up front, first taste is fudge cut by a light sting of peppery bourbon and savory charred oak. It then thickens and smooths mid-palate to a more viscous consistency where a prickly carbonation arises before the semi-dry, lightly sticky swallow brings up a touch of heat.

Caramel glides in on the second sip, as do lighter notes of root beer and roasted nuts. Even though it thickens mid-palate, it honestly goes down so quickly as it transitions to a cola feel towards the swallow that it's hard to contemplate, but after one sip I'm exhaling char and fudge for days.

It's not QUITE as good as BCBS, but it's close. As I say this, I think to compare my ratings, and it's even closer than I expected, being only .01 off!",4.38
Thundertaker,"Pours a deep black with minimal head and no lacing.

The smell is very sweet dark fruits, char, whiskey, maple, and vanilla.

The taste is barrel heavy, sweet, vanilla, maple, char, leather, and some dark fruits.

The mouthfeel is low carbonation, medium/thick body, and very smooth.

Overall this is excellent, tons of great flavors, nice feel, awesome barrel. Really well done beer.",4.5
Thundertaker,"This one pours a very dark black color, with a small head, and not much lacing.

This smells like molasses, rye candy, dark bittersweet maple syrup, oak spice, tobacco, heavy roast, cocoa powder, and vanilla.

This is easily one of the best just straight up barrel aged stouts that I've ever had. So much interesting and complex flavor is wrung from the barrel aging process here. There's a killer and intriguing sweetness here - mainly feels like maple and molasses, with some sweet powdery chocolate, and vanilla as well. There's also spicy and heavy oak character, with a wonderful bourbon heat to it. The cool sweetness from the beer might come from the barrel, might come from the malt. The rye spice with the sweetness is just great.

This is medium bodied, creamy, and with no real booziness to it. There's some warmth, but no outward astringency. It's very drinkable.

This is just a perfect example of an amazing beer being made especially for an amazing barrel. Revolution should be extremely proud of this effort.",4.81
Thundertaker,"Pitch black body with a finger of brown foam. Aromas of semi-sweet chocolate backed up by rich and dark bourbon, oak, rye, char, earth, tobacco, molasses, and raisin. Taste is much the same, a touch of leather here and there, but less of the dark fruit flavors, booze is showcased in a powerful yet balanced way. Feel is warm, smooth, chewy, thick, and heavy with the barrel character really showing itself. Best rye ba stout of the year so far! The wife loved it",4.64
Thundertaker,"One of the best pure barrel beers I can remember having. Boozy up front that moves to vanilla as it warms. Nice body, toes the line well of having substance but not being overtly thick. A real treat of a stout with no added flavor.",4.62
Pressed - Stroopwafel,"16oz can from Tavour. Black pour, fizzy beige head fades to flat. Aroma is chocolate, cinnamon, light coffee. Taste brings more chocolate, vanilla, coffee, honey, cinnamon. Coffee bitterness lingers. Slick, not too heavy, ABV is masked well.",4.01
Pressed - Stroopwafel,"poured from a 16oz can into a TG MD snifter. pours a semi see through brown but gathers in the glass a light black with virtually no head. a thin collar of mocha brown foam presides around the rim of the glass. roasted malts, light toffee and chocolate and a kiss of cinnamon on the nose. as it warms there’s a slight alcohol sting. taste is chocolate, caramel, light coffee and cinnamon. i don’t get a lot of coffee but it’s still a nice flavor combination. incredibly full mouthfeel that finishes thick and sticky. drinks like an imperial stout. another enjoyable pressed entry. this one was actually less sweet then i thought it was going to be. lots of caramel, toffee and a bit of cinnamon. really good.",4.28
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Of all things, picked up a bottle of this delicious nectar at a liquor store in Clovis NM (hilltop liquor store).

The beer pours the expected blackish brown color, with very good head retention and lacing. The nose is fairly typical for a Firestone anniversary ale, showcasing considerable brown sugar, vanilla, light molasses, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee and light bourbon. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this rich, moderately sweet beer. The cacaphony of different flavors blend together very, very well in this rather luscious beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full, and the finish is long, soft, creamy and rather decadent. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell the abv is up there a bit. Drinkability is pretty good considering, and this beer makes an absolutely delightful after dinner aperitif.

Excellent beer from the folks at FW. Have had most of their anniversary beers, and this is clearly one of the better ones (IMHO). Impressive.",4.5
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"12 oz bottle. Pours dark brown with tall, creamy, long-lasting, brown head and nice lacing. Aroma is of rum, sherry, caramel malt, vanilla, chocolate and dark fruit.

Finish is long and dry. Outstanding brew.",4.88
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"I'd been looking with great envy at how West coast BAs regard the output of this brewery until my daughter came through with a Christmas present. Today was Father's day so why not.

Whoever does the blending of this really knows their craft because this is very refreshing in taste and mouthfeel. It doesn't feel complex so much as very easy to drink; probably dangerously so if I wasn't planning on remaining relatively stationary. I wish I had additional bottles to age because I think cellaring might do very interesting things but that's for some lucky soul to discover on his/her own. I'm just glad I had this. Sláinte.",4.45
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"After a few of these it’s time to crack my knuckles & type some words about it. 12 oz. bottle with a classy, severe label of blue & pale gold.

The pour is just light of stout, with some dark brown & cerise creeping around the edges. For all the components, the nose is surprisingly light: booze & chocolate. More coming, I hope.

Firestone Walker XXV enters the lower echelon of a fabled line of anniversary brews. Impressions I’ve had of this beer are confirmed: it’s thin & muddled. For all the marvelous beers dunked herein, what results is light barrel, mostly brandy, faint chocolate, light tequila (growing as it warms), leather, & a finish of oak. Splitting the bottle with my lovely wife, as I have in the past, seems like a good idea now.

Flipping back, this is the weakest of the series since XVII. A pretty good beer. Disappointing.",3.36
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Bottle Date: 2021
Palate Contaminants: none

Dark brown color with tan head. Not much of that, though, so not much lacing.

Sticky dark fruit on the nose, and there's a savory depth to it. A little raisin, a little prune, and a little fig. There's also some creamer/lactic scent going on, as well as vanilla and clove. Very pleasant.

It's even heavier on the fruit in the taste, and I'd especially say the raisin is dialed up. Distinct sweetness, although it's not overpowering. The next main flavor is coffee, and it goes along with moderate-light bitterness. The sweetness seems to link to brown sugar late.

Weight is heavy; it sits on the back of my tongue. Carbonation is fine and well integrated. Alcohol taste isn't much present, although one can feel the ABV eventually. Unsurprisingly, the aftertaste is coffee and raisins.",4.49
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Picked up a 12 oz bottle while visiting PHX 3-11-22 for $9.99. Also brought back a Crowler to share with friends. Consumed for review 5-17-22.

Beer poured dark brown with an okay tan head.

Nose is quite nice, bourbon, leather, vanilla, and tequila are very pungent.

Taste is superb, a large malt base comprised of five different beers allows the bourbon, vanilla, tequila, and dark fruits to express nicely with the usual amount of hopping still remaining, along with the barrel presence, to balance the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied and very smooth.

Overall another delightful Anniversary brew...will need to work on obtaining some every year!",4.43
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Appearance: Pours espresso colored with a thin beige head that fades to a ringlet; dots of lacing

Smell: Other than the blend of various barrel aromatics (Bourbon and Brandy, with a hint of Tequila) the caramel is significant along with a spice cake character

Taste: Caramel and spice cake forward with the barrel blend emerging; even though the Bourbon barrels predominate it is the Brandy barrel which directs the flavor profile; the Tequila arrives in the rear; sticky, sweet and complex finish that is reminiscent of a Dr Pepper

Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet

Overall: Just another great beer from the barrel aging pros",4.34
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Growler into pint glass. Pours an inky black with essentially no head. Initial impression is surprisingly easy-drinking, with notes of blackstrap molasses, caramel, roasted malts, booze, and a touch of bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium, thick and smooth yet dinitely not cloying. Finish is slightly boozy, but so well balanced that it is an asset rather than an issue.

Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,I am becoming a huge Firestone Walker fan. Everything I have tried has been excellent. This is my first Anniversary Ale.

Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"Pours black with two and a half fingers of dense khaki-colored foam. A deep foam ring forms around the top of the beer for a long while after the pour. Aroma is heavy roasty and toasty malts with thick caramel and earthy malts behind. Interstitial space is full of barrel, whiskey, brown sugar, dark fruits, and some faint notes of fudge. It has a sweet start, but is undercut by spicy whiskey, although in harmony, this works to create a beautiful balance. Flavor profile is roasty, toasty, and earthy malts. Dark fruits, caramel, and molasses develop a smooth sweetness, which is balanced out by late whiskey and barrel. The latter offers up some heavy, strong notes, without being hot. Some sticky, resiny hops sit in between the sugary notes, adding a little bitterness for balance. Mouth feel is thick with a near soft effervescence, carrying just enough silt to keep it from being plush. Instead, this silt works to elevate the texture out of forgettable. Overall, incredibly rich in depth and notes. It drinks smooth, without coming off complex, and yet there are layers to peel away in every sip.

Medium plus body, silky feel; burn on tip of tongue; warmth from 11.5% abv; light carbonation; dry wooden finish.

Dark brown, foamy head, lasting lacing. Notes of dark fruit, molasses, and brandy on the nose. Barrels are quite assertive on the taste. Dark fruit presence again, slightly sweet. It’s thinner than I expected, have to see if it rounds as it warms. Very boozy. I think with some age, this is going to be an excellent beer.",4.58
Firestone 25 - Anniversary Ale,"I very much want to find a couple of more copies and cellar them as 25 needs some time to blend its blend.
25 is only my second in this series (I'm always late to parties.) But this whole process of collaboratively blending with winemakers that is described on the sheet in the box is as elaborate as I can imagine for a brewer and very Californiana.

I will do this brew justice and finish this review after I've aged and mellowed 25. Great potential.",4.27

Big toffee and caramel from the barrels. The brandy barrel really shines and get some of the tequila barrel at the end. Nicely balanced and not very boozy given the abv and 5 barrels. This is a really good sipper",4.55
Space Dust,"Poured from a stovepipe can into a spieglau IPA glass.

On the pour nearly 4 fingers of fine white head formed that peeks out over top of the glass. Body is lightly hazy woth some hop sediment and is an orange brass hue. Some lacing is left.

Aroma is quite tropical and fruity woth a bit of darkness on the back. Quite a bit of citrus on this one and maybe even some guava. Like a better voodoo ranger, but not game changing.

Taste follows the aroma, and stays quite clean and fruity, but there is a definite sweetness and alcohol that gives away the abv. The hop bitterness creeps in as the sweetness fades, making this relatively balanced although the sweet and bitter don't happen at the same time.

Feel is big but still refreshingly hoppy and bright. The finish is long and quite full bodied, and as the sweetness fades it almost feels like it slowly coats your tongue. This one's pretty fun to drink but there are some heavy feelings that make me knock a few points.

Overall this is pretty good and also pretty predictable. Clean and hoppy with big tropical and fruity vibes as well as a solid dose of dank and bitterness. A bit heavy but solid quality.",3.73
Space Dust,"Look: Gold, decent head

Smell: Citrus! Oranges and pineapple mainly, smells amazing

Bits of just-right all around: hoppy and piney, citrusy and crisp, nice carbonation, refreshing, not too strong. Maybe a little weak in the feel catagory.
Had it on Draft, in bottles too.

Space Dust,"Damn, that's a good IPA. Hop forward, not too bitter but definitely bitter enough. Pours gold with light lacing. Smell is super citrusy - pineapple, orange and coriander. And it packs a punch in the abv department without being boozy.",4.55

Space Dust,"Poured from a 4 months old bottle. Slightly hazy, as a good IPA should be, IMO. Good head and lacing.
I love how unpretentious this beer is, just good old hops and a lot of malt flavor to back that up. It's bitter, and the hop oils coat and stay in your tongue for a while; but this is not a bad thing. Besides, by the time you realize this is happening, you don't care anymore from that 8.2 ABV.

Poured copper, bright reddish copper with very active carbonation but little head and no lacing.
Aroma was almost lost on my damaged nose completely, very mild. A bit of malts gets through and an indiscernible sweetness rather after the sniff. Hmmm.
The taste was very good actually, the sweetness found its way to the front, a bit of vanilla, touch of cherries and a hint of orange. All wrapped up in bourbon. At least to start with, after a few minutes it settles down and the rest of the flavors are back. I think I need to get a new one and try it fresh.

Highball Drifter is surprisingly tame. Delicate oranges shake hands with gentle bitters & a low level of bourbon. Sweetness winds throughout with a touch of vanilla on the finish. Alcohol sneaks up on one. Glad I split this itty bitty bottle.

Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Highball Drifter from Founders. Purchased from Franklin Beer Company, Franklin, PA, 12/08/22 for $ 14.50(Including tax)/four-pack of 12 oz bottles ($ 0.30/oz). On room-temperature shelf at store and stored at 37 degrees at home. Reviewed 26/08/22. Note that I use DD/MM/YY protocol.
Stamped “BOTTLED ON 06.09.22” on the rear label. Served at 51.9 degrees in a hand washed and dried Jester King Snifter. Final temperature 58.8 degrees.
Appearance – 3.
First pour – Medium Amber (SRM 12), CLEAR.
Body – Brown (SRM 20), opaque. Under direct light, same. When rear-lite, ruby and clear.
Head – Average (Maximum two cm, aggressive center pour), wheat, high density, short retention, receding to a 0.5 to 2.5 mm ring of tiny bubbles constantly being renewed by effervescence (No crown per se) and a small island for a cap.
Lacing – None.
Aroma – 3.25 – Not much, just a weak fruitiness. No malt, no hops, no yeast.
Flavor – 4.5 – Begins slightly sweet and generally citrus fruity, no malt, no hops, no yeast. No ethanol (11 % ABV as marked on label) aroma or taste. No distinct cherry or orange; instead, a mulled yet flavorful blend. Bourbon is not distinct but ties all the flavors together. Moderate lower gastric warming. No dimethylsulfide or diacetyl.
Palate – 3.5 – Medium, slightly thicker than water, lively carbonation.
Final impression and summation: 4.5 This far, this is probably my favorite from the Bottle Shop series, although I’ve never had a highball. The flavor is well-blended and tasty, with enough linalool (and hidden ethanol) to sedate. I’m headed to my local distributor later to pick up a case!",4.01

Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"A moderate pour into a pint glass yielded a fine one inch head, which replenished enough for the glass to lace nicely during consumption. I detected only bourbon and vanilla on the nose, which left me unprepared for taste explosion! chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, caramel, sea salt, and scotch with a toasted bread note developing on the nose. The taste is boozy and more complex than I expected, the mouthfeel is lovely... I cannot find fault with this brew! Yeah, two ice cubes and two cherries in a highball glass, why not! Founders has accomplished the cocktail feel they sought! I'm loving it!",4.44
Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"12 oz bottle, born on 7/7/21, poured into a Founders snifter at 55 degrees F:
L - brown and somewhat translucent with a hazelnut head that lingered
S - caramel, dark fruit
T - drinks like a barleywine, caramel and toffee with dark fruits
F - silky and thick with minimal carbonation
O - very nice, not what I was expecting",4.5
Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"From the growler in a snifter via Country Fresh Market Beechmont. This solid
brew pours a red tinged brown with a nice head of white foam that settles to a thick ring,
thin clumping layer, and shows light lacing. Nose of cherry, bourbon, orange, and
vanilla with rich caramel and brown sugar notes. Flavors hit the mark with
brown sugar and caramel mellowed by orange, cherry, vanilla, bourbon, light
oak, and golden raisin with a hint of cranberry. Nice mouth feel; medium body,
smooth, warming, light verging on medium light carbonation, and a medium dry
finish.

Overall----solid!

Cheers",4.21
Bottle Shop Series #2: Highball Drifter,"Look: Resembles a red ale liquid. Dense off white head that somewhat quickly dissipates to a 1/4 inch ring around the glass with wispy clouds in the center. Nice finger lace in the sides.
Smell and Taste: Hints of tart cherries and orange zest countered by sweet maltiness.
Feel: First I will say at 11% ABV I knew its would feel good LOL. Feel blend of crispness and smoothness.
Overall: Excelent. Rack up another win for Founders.",4.2
